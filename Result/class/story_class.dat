272411	how google can open up image labeler to entrepreneurs and accelerate a.i. progress	google image labeler	3
http://images.google.com/imagelabeler/	0
allows people to play a game labelling images, thus give data towards their machine learning research on image recognition. why don't they open this up to entrepreneurs ? (or amazon, yahoo, or some startups take up the opportunity to do the same)<p>what i'm suggesting is that a "gold rush" type situation form around the building of classifiers (a type of machine learning algorithm), such as that occurred with website creation. there are millions trying to get an income onlne creating content for adsense and affilate programs (and for free with wikipedia and open source). most will fail at generating reasonable income but in the process a large amount of wealth has been created.<p>the same could be done for classifiers/artifical intelligence. for each classifier it would require collecting a thousand or two pieces of data (image/sudio/text) to create a classifier, an effort similar to creating a small website. for each use of the classifier at customer would pay, say some fraction of cent (or whatever the market will bear).<p>i'm trying to draw a parallel between how content on the web is being created and how an artificial mind might be created.  if you sat down at tried to engineer a giant encyclopedia within one company/community, you would end up with britannica (within one company), and wikipedia (within a community of enthusiasts), however, the web at large is much larger than both of these because of the economic incentives for people to create articles. many people try and fail (in effect working for free), but the progress is rapid, as in evolution. in the same way, incentivizing people to produce classifiers would have the similar effect of rapid progress.<p>these classification algorithms are already available, boosting, random forests, support vector machine, and it would require some companies to host them and make them easily available so that ordinary people can start using them and get the ball rolling (how blogs and adsense made it easy for people to easily publish and monetize their content).<p>i might collect 1000 images of cats, send it to a classifier host that would then apply support vector machine to it for 2 hours, charge me 40 cents (at 20 cents per hour of usage of one cpu), i might then send the created classifier file to another host (whose business is to host classifiers) and set a rate of 1000 uses for 1 cent lets say (i might receive 80 percent of this, and the hoster 20 percent). then anyone who wants to identify if there are cats in their image would connect to and use the cat classifier, paying me a fraction of a cent each time.<p>for any given image i would probably want to apply thousands of different classifiers. somebody might have created a service that aggregates 2000 diffferent animal classifiers and i would send my image there and recieve results for a fee (each of those classifier creators would receive a sum of money, as would the aggregator).<p>initial applications for this include surveillance technology and is already in use. a much larger market is robotics.	0
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/video_analytics<p>if you think of intelligence as being the ability to predict accurately, having a giant web of classifiers that predict accurately could be construed as a form of artificial general intelligence, or a human type artificial intelligence. having enough data about the world, because you have created many classifiers that can recognize the semantic events in video and speech, would allow you to make all the same types of recognitions and predictions that a human would make.<p>machine learning and computer vision open source tools	4

1822872	please review my friends startup frently (no technical co-founder)	http://frently.com/ (clickable in comments)<p>so two of my friends created this frently. it's quite amazing to me since they have no real experience with the web yet so far they've executed so well. yes, no technical co-founders.<p>no it's not a dating site.	3
no it's not for those who are socially inept.<p>it seems very airbnb-ish. i personally think it's very useful for those who travel to unfamiliar places and would love to be "show around town". also, if your like my roommate who is very friendly and wouldn't mind having a little extra cash to help with her guitar addiction.	2010-10-23 06:57:23 UTC	2
5793900	ask hn: next round of financing	i own a brick and mortar business i started w 2 friends over a year ago. one partner and i put up equal amts of money to capitalize the business. i run operations and did all the legwork involved to start the business. the partner who put up money w me had limited involvement at the outset and has less involvement at present, since he has a career elsewhere. partner 3 runs operations w me and was compensated w a small amt of equity.<p>we broke even in yr 1 and are on track to make a profit this year. we've done a great job of branding, pr, and customer service which huge in a brick and mortar business.<p>recently, an investment group approached us. investment is an attractive option bc it would allow us to corner the market in our city and expand outside of it at a faster rate. growing "organically" w/o the help of investment is less attractive bc it is a linear process and the time horizon for expanding is further, running the risk of competition crowding us out of an already crowded market.<p>the group has proposed that they would buy the non-operating partner out of his shares and then capitalize us from there. this partner understands the attractiveness of investment and he also understands the potential stability and opportunity it would give me and my operating partner, but he's also expressed that he didn't invest in us to make a nominal sum of money a year later (even if it is 2-3x what he put in). question 1, what is an equitable way to handle this situation?<p>also, i have a realistic number of what our company is worth today, but i fear that if our non-operating partner were given his "fair share" for the company from that number and then we were flooded with the investment that the group is talking about, my other partner and i would be diluted to &#60;5% collectively (barring any additional guarantees). if that were to happen, i would be fearful of losing control of the company. what sort of guarantees should we ask for? red flags to look for?	2013-05-30 17:34:33 UTC	4

1218933	ask hn: looking for an internship this summer at a boston-area tech startup	i'm a college freshman looking for an internship this summer at a small boston-area tech startup. i have extensive experience in php/mysql/xhtml/css/javascript, but a purely technical job is not the sum total of what i'm looking for. i want to find a startup small enough that i can participate in the day-to-day process of generating ideas and plotting a way forward for the company. i'm constantly working on projects of my own, and there's nothing i enjoy more than brainstorming a new product on a whiteboard and then hacking it out all night. here are some of my past projects:<p>http://www.eduset.com/<p>http://www.songite.com/<p>http://www.spinjay.com/<p>i also created and subsequently sold songerize.com (now defunct), which was covered on lifehacker, mashable, and cnet.<p>my past work experience includes work at three boston-area tech startups during high school, ranging in size from 3 people to 40+. here's my linkedin profile:<p>http://www.linkedin.com/in/wjohnson191<p>if you think that your startup might be a good match for me, or if you know of a startup that i should get in touch with, let me know, either in the comments or at wjohnson [at] eduset.com.	2010-03-25 17:34:58 UTC	2

(as it appears new jersey is doing with email and fax ballots.) does this open a slippery slope to some employers requiring that their employees submit a voting receipt?<p>* are multiple-factor voting systems a realistic way forward. i.e., electronic systems that print out multiple receipts: one to take home and one to submit as a paper ballot for [proactive?] re-counting and checking the electronic system?	2012-11-06 13:01:00 UTC	0

254849	ask hn: are frameworks the way to go?	as both languages are new to me, i completed tutorials, scanned through a couple of books on the safari books online site regarding both ruby and python (day job is .net work).  though both were nice, i enjoyed python a little more.<p>i have an idea for a website that i think may be able to help folks out a bit, it could be considered a startup i suppose, but ultimately i am aiming to gain ‘real’ experience in the language that may be applicable in becoming a developer for a startup.<p>which leads me to my questions, are frameworks ultimately the way to go and are most startups using frameworks? also, both django and pylons are both appealing; i won’t ask a broad question like which one is better, but simply ask for any advice for selecting one instead of the other (or another one that i may have overlooked)?<p>thanks.	2008-07-23 22:05:59 UTC	3

7619831	ask hn: interview saturdays instead of interviews during work hours?	as i know people and as i have myself interviewed in places, it becomes pretty clear that the process itself is pretty awful. you have to take off from work and then meet the prospective employers - there is the obvious aspect of lying to your current employer as to where you are really going. then the whole process becomes even more difficult when you want to evaluate multiple opportunities. most startups want you to meet the team, and when i say team i mean the actual team, the ceo, the office manager, the spouse, the resident dog and the delivery man. the whole thing becomes this massive time sink which, although completely necessary, starts intruding on the day to day operations of the current job. some folks dont have the luxury of quitting before looking and i was wondering if the concept of interview saturdays make sense? the prospective employers and interviewers can get through their day jobs without constant interview interruptions. the prospective interviewee doesnt have to lie or get behind on work. everyone wins! except saturday, but then if you are in a hot startup, then tough shit. the time spent interviewing folks during the week will carry over to your nights and weekend anyway. this interview saturday will help you figure out people who are willing to make the sacrifices (saturday gone) and will lead to less drawn out interview loops - also more efficient tracking of time spent on interviews if you silo the time.<p>what do you think?	2014-04-21 04:47:16 UTC	1

5523992	how can we get google support?	the symfony project, an open-source project (http://symfony.com/), uses google groups to host its mailing-lists. the service is free and we really appreciate it, but for no reasons, google closed our access to one of our mailing-lists (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/symfony2).<p>that happened a few weeks ago and thanks to some inside people at google, the mailing-list reappeared. as the admin of the list, i received no email about the closing of the mailing-list, no explanations, and not even an email when the mailing-list reopened after a few days of black-out.<p>i was not happy with this situation but i thought it was just a glitch. but then, some days ago, they did it again. the mailing-list is not accessible anymore, not even by me (the admin).<p>there is no way to get support, no way to get in touch with someone at google. this is really frustrating. of course, this is a free service and google can do whatever they want, but i would at least expect a way to get some kind of support (hell, i'm even ready to pay fot it)... or at least, some kind of email (even an automatic one) telling me what we did wrong (and i doubt that we did anything wrong as the mailing-list is moderated and we are only talking about yet another php framework).<p>help! how can i get in touch with someone at google? how can we get by our mailing-list?	2013-04-10 09:02:53 UTC	2

3292873	ask hn, the influence of buzzwords in the it industry	hello,<p>i am a masters student and i have recently started preparing my thesis, i will present my idea and i want to hear your opinions on it. the reason i am asking is because i don't know much about the it corporate world and my thesis is aimed at it.<p>so here we go, as the title of this submission suggests, the topic is the influence of buzzwords in the it industry.<p>if you go to almost any website that sells an it product aimed at corporations you will notice a lot of buzzwords, a lot of marketing. my personal opinion, based on brief experience, is that because of this marketing clutter it is difficult for the reader to understand what the software actually does and what it's real features are but of course it makes the product more attractive to the potential (naive/ignorant) buyer. buzzwords and marketing talk are common in it so it must mean they work, they generate sales.<p>what i would set up to do in my thesis is, try and find out how much using buzzwords influences someone's opinion on a software product.<p>just to give you an idea, one of the things i could do is, take a a number people who work in it and ask them to chose between two products that do almost the same thing. one of them, product p1, is described straightforward, putting the emphasis on making it clear what the product's features are(like you would describe it to a friend, but still using adequate/formal language) and the other, product p2, is described pompously, using buzzwords and such.	3
at the end, see which product of the two gets chosen more often, expecting product p2 to be the favourite. i would also ask the ones who chose p2, why they did it, why do they feel p2 is better.<p>the example above is an unpolished idea, i haven't thought out much detail about how i will do the actual research yet, because i want to find out if my assumptions are valid, which is why i am opening this thread.<p>so my assumptions are the following:	1
1. buzzwords are abundant in the corporate it world.	1
2. buzzwords give a superficial image of a product, making it look modern and powerful without disclosing it's real features and a lot of people fall into this trap.<p>what do you think, does this have a potential of yielding some interesting results, is it based on reality or just the ramblings of an ignorant(me)? are my assumptions accurate?<p>i would be happy to hear especially from people who work in the corporate it world and deal with this sort of thing.<p>thanks!	2011-11-29 23:39:43 UTC	1

1737007	how often does one cofounder think he is contributing more than the others?	i hear about all these 2 or 3 person startups and get the impression that somehow they all have perfectly distributed the workload and each cofounder is completely content with the performance of the others.  yet, i have tried working with a few different people, and each time i get frustrated and demotivated because i feel i am contributing more than the others towards designing, building, and releasing a product.<p>i am wondering whether:<p>1) this is a problem with my attitude and my ability to work with others<p>2) my feelings are justified, and is why i need to choose cofounders very carefully<p>3) my feelings may have validity, but to be successful i need to do the best i can instead of worrying about who deserves what, and everybody will win as a result<p>i know distinguishing between these three depends a lot on the specifics of the situation.  i'm wondering what your guys' experiences this have been, and how you may have learned to tell them apart or handle it.<p>thanks.	2010-09-28 19:55:33 UTC	3

4616061	i host ~25 low traffic websites & have some questions about moving to aws	i've been using shared hosting, dedicated servers &#38; dedicated virtual servers with pretty straight forward pricing for years now, but after just hating the service, ui &#38; reliability most of the services i've come across (godaddy, 1&#38;1, network solutions, dreamhost, etc) and then recently running into an issue with mediatemple not allowing adult sites (i host 2 adult sites)... aws seems to be my final frontier of hosting.<p>so, since i want to put all my sites on 1 server (they're mostly side projects &#38; a few clients sites) to make my life easier... what does hn suggest when using aws?<p>~20 of the sites average 10-50 hits a day<p>~5 of the sites  average 100-300 hits a day<p>about once a month, when mentioned by a blog or new marketing comes out, 2 or 3 of the sites will hit 1000 hits a day for a day or two and then go back down to their regular traffic sizes.<p>~5 are magento stores<p>~15 are wordpress sites<p>~5 are static html sites with just a few pages<p>all but 1 of the magento stores are actually just magento sites being worked on, and wont live on the server for more than few months time. however there will always be at least this many on the box as i work on more stores.<p>my questions:<p>1. what service is right for me? ec2?<p>2. is aws just total overkill?<p>3. if aws is a good idea, what size instance/server/service should i use?<p>4. what kind of prices am i looking at?<p>i would love to pay no more than 100/month if at all possible, but obviously if i need to i'm open to paying more. i am a firm believer in you get what you pay for. if better hosting costs more, than so be it.	2012-10-05 08:20:20 UTC	0

5764692	ask hn: best time to visit sf this summer?	hi there, i’m a cs student from arizona with a year left before i graduate college. my passion for startups started about a year ago when i discovered hacker news. every time i read about startups and people building things to show on hn, it gives me courage to continue with my dream of diving into the world of startups one day, ideally once i graduate. i’ve been working diligently on a couple of side projects during my free time for a while now, which helps me keep engaged in web development. this summer i’m interning in seattle, wa as a software developer, and i’ll finally have enough money saved up to visit san francisco for the first time.<p>i was hoping to gain some insight from the startup community in san francisco as to what the best time this summer might be to visit “the city.” i have until august 2 before my internship comes to an end, so any weekend from now until august will work! i am looking to probably arrive on a thursday night and return to seattle the following sunday. this will give me a chance to use all day friday to pay a visit to any startups that would be open to the idea of me visiting their office space that day! i am also looking for a place to stay, so if you have any recommendation as to where the best places to stay are, i would greatly appreciate any suggestions you may have!<p>if you work at a startup in sf, or know of someone who works at a startup, who would be open to the idea of me visiting your office space, send me an e-mail at jlteran@cs.arizona.edu or comment on here!<p>cheers!	2013-05-24 19:02:46 UTC	3

908645	splitting from my business partner - my journey in self esteem	this is the story of my personal journey and my relationship with my business partner.  our business is still alive and solvent, but i've moved on.  even though i'll be throwing away 2 years worth of work, writing off a significant amount of cash, and having to start from scratch again i strongly believe i'll be better off starting again.<p>the business partnership started off great.  we tried a few ideas (all of which could have been grown into something good i believe), and then we settled on our first (and only) real moneymaker.<p>we were from different backgrounds – he had the gift of the gab, was an amazing salesman in some areas, had experience and boldness.  he was bankrupt, but that was no problem as i wasn't borrowing money off him (warning sign?).  i was an intelligent but inexperienced techy, who needed a bit of a confidence boost.  the early days of the partnership worked out great as we complimented each others strengths and weaknesses really well.<p>we built this organically, never over-stretching ourselves.  i quit my day job, and my partner took the same wage as me.  he didn't quit his work as he had substantial financial commitments, but he could do his work outside of our business hours.  (warning sign?)<p>the friction started as we became a little larger.  we were pulling in $10-15k a month, but all of it other than our ramen wage got spent.  larger offices, unneeded staff, lots of advertising.  basically the money all went into making us look good, and saving our time.  a lot of the costs could have been saved by being us founders being more hands-on, and i always wanted to cut costs, but let most of the spendings go ahead.<p>our next project was to copy a franchise idea we'd seen that we could do at a fraction of the cost.  the only problem with this was that the franchise was a dud in the first place – it's so important to do your own research.  once we'd pulled the plug on this (never an easy decision), we moved onto our next project.  more frivolous spending, and here's the painful bit.  we figured we needed investment and a larger space.  my business partner borrowed a large amount, and i personally guaranteed a property lease which was a similar commitment.<p>as you may have guessed, we then set about spending all this money with great haste, only slowing  down as we ran out of money.  as this was going on, i was building the new business almost single-handedly, working ever hour i could.  eventually enough got to be enough.  i was putting my whole life into the business, i'd loaned it an additional money and forsaken wages so that i was in debt, and while i could see the way forwards my business partner was not bringing anything helpful to the table.  the last straw was money that had been promised as a loan to the business by my business partner went to pay for his personal spending.<p>it's now been 6 months since i quit.  the first month was spent working at a good speed, building a new business (that i ultimately never did much with).  the next 3 months were spent sat on my ass, and the last 2 months have been spent working for someone else.  if i were to go through another bad time like this again, i'd have bitten the bullet and taken a job much sooner, as i believe that it's this that really pulled me back onto my feet.  i'm now starting to get the fire back into my belly, and am ready to start my next adventure.<p>what i've learned from this is that i knew for a long time that the partnership wasn't right, and that the business wasn't going in the direction i wanted to take it.  i should never have let things slide and let my business partner take financial decisions i wasn't happy with.  the business would either have been much stronger, or we'd have split apart much earlier if i'd been stronger.  i should also have trusted in myself and my own ability much more, rather than deferring to my more experienced business partner or our advisers.  never let anyone else make the big decisions for you.  being an entrepreneur is about leading, about creating something new, and making something big.	2009-10-28 20:07:40 UTC	0

(http:&#x2f;&#x2f;d.pr&#x2f;i&#x2f;lwar)<p>if a company is accidentally offering an upgrade at rmb 2.99 to chinese customers, should they honor it, even if it&#x27;s in error?<p>moreover, should users even be paying for this upgrade? boxer is running a &quot;get the $4.99 usd version of boxer for free&quot; campaign (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;d.pr&#x2f;i&#x2f;swgn). moreover, when you get in on this special offer, the itunes download page makes no mention of this actually being a trial version, nor does it state a paid upgrade is necessary when exchange is mentioned (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;d.pr&#x2f;i&#x2f;u5kg)(http:&#x2f;&#x2f;d.pr&#x2f;i&#x2f;kjto).<p>is this bait-and-switch, or has the strategy involved with in-app purchasing changed the definition of &quot;free?&quot;<p>i know a lot of you are in start-ups and are developers of some of my favorite apps so i&#x27;m curious about your ideas on the subject (from a business perspective) and advice (from the customer perspective).	2013-06-14 02:35:08 UTC	0

(how could i ever afford one?) will i get any benefit from putting my tiny projects up on hackerone or bugcrowd?	2015-02-04 22:11:38 UTC	2

5674293	dsl platform - domain-driven design based mda	we are proud to open our invasive software composition platform for a public beta.	3
in short, it's a compiler for model driven architecture based on domain-driven design.	4
beta is running on top of postgres. for now we have opened up php, with java and c# support coming by the end of the month.<p>what is it?	1
you write your application model in a dsl - which is meant to be easy to read.	1
our dsl platform takes your model, migrates your database and gives you back a compiled library to use (php for web, java for android, etc...)	1
objects in that library will map 1:1 to dsl you have provided and will be type safe; even php is kind of type-safe ;).	0
if you are familiar with ddd you should feel right at home writing dsl; if not, our docs should help you to quickly get started.	2013-05-08 14:30:39 UTC	4

3278089	ask hn: can you recommend a path to developing on linux?	hi,<p>i am, by profession, a .net web developer. i wish to start programming more in my free time, perhaps whip up a few interesting projects, and at the same time learn some new skills. so an obvious path is to start with development on linux as it's something i'm absolutely unfamiliar with. therefore i'm looking for advice, useful links etc. on how to get into the world of development on linux.<p>i really need help from the ground up so i can hit the ground running, but without being thrown into the deep end so badly that it's too much of an uphill struggle - i want to be eased into it basically!<p>i'm only vaguely familiar with linux as an os, so firstly is there a particular distro that is recommended for development purposes? will ubuntu suffice? also i have no idea what tools to use to develop. i understand vim and emacs are proficient ides, but they seem like something i should explore at a later date given their seemingly steep learning curve. finally i'd like some objective discussion on which language(s) i should choose to get me going, specifically with web development being my main focus e.g. if python is suggested, why is it a good choice, what are the downsides, what frameworks should i investigate etc.<p>so that nobody takes offence, i apologise in advance if i've used the wrong terminology throughout my question - i've really been living a life of ignorance when it comes to linux and the tools available.<p>thanks	2011-11-25 20:12:33 UTC	3

(i know this has been done to death, it's just for illustrative purposes). is there any service that lets you implement this kind of payments system (i.e. let new sellers register and receive payments straight to their account) or would i have to handle the payments centrally and redistribute to end recipients myself? any heads up much appreciated. thanks.	2010-12-25 15:17:40 UTC	3
