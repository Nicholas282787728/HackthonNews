2195225	ask hn: parsing access logs for amazon s3	my startup is looking at building an metric service on top of some static resources we serve from amazon s3.  we started investigating this and came across the following statement on log delivery:<p>==start documentation==	2
amazon s3 documentation:	3
best effort server log delivery<p>the server access logging feature is designed for best effort. you can expect that most requests against a bucket that is properly configured for logging will result in a delivered log record, and that most log records will be delivered within a few hours of the time that they were recorded.<p>however, the server logging feature is offered on a best-effort basis. the completeness and timeliness of server logging is not guaranteed. the log record for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually processed, or it might not be delivered at all. the purpose of server logs is to give the bucket owner an idea of the nature of traffic against his or her bucket. it is not meant to be a complete accounting of all requests.	4
==end documentation==<p>i'm looking around for any information i can find about the reliability of the logging service.  i've seen some reports of logs taking several hours to show up.  have others had experience building similar systems or with s3 logging who can share some insight?<p>(full disclosure, link to my unanswered stack overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/q/4923756/223440)	2011-02-08 22:31:39 UTC	4	0	1

519931	the financial crisis in simpler terms...drinkbonds, alkbonds, and pukebonds	via e-mail:<p>the financial crisis explained in simple terms.......<p>heidi is the proprietor of a bar in berlin. in order to increase sales, she decides to allow her loyal customers - most of whom are unemployed alcoholics - to drink now but pay later. she keeps track of the drinks consumed on a ledger (thereby granting the customers loans). word gets around and as a result increasing numbers of customers flood into heidi's bar.  taking advantage of her customers' freedom from immediate payment constraints, heidi increases her prices for wine and beer, the most-consumed beverages. her sales volume increases massively.<p>a young and dynamic customer service consultant at the local bank recognizes these customer debts as valuable future assets and increases heidi's borrowing limit.	4
he sees no reason for undue concern since he has the debts of the alcoholics as collateral.  at the bank's corporate headquarters, expert bankers transform these customer assets into drinkbonds, alkbonds and pukebonds. these securities are then traded on markets worldwide. no one really understands what these abbreviations mean and how the securities are guaranteed. nevertheless, as their prices continuously climb, the securities become top-selling items.<p>one day, although the prices are still climbing, a risk manager (subsequently of course fired due his negativity) of the bank decides that slowly the time has come to demand payment of the debts incurred by the drinkers at heidi's bar.  however they cannot pay back the debts. heidi cannot fulfill her loan obligations and claims bankruptcy.  drinkbond and alkbond drop in price by 95 %. pukebond performs better, stabilizing in price after dropping by 80 %.<p>the suppliers of heidi's bar, having granted her generous payment due dates and having invested in the securities are faced with a new situation. her wine supplier claims bankruptcy, her beer supplier is taken over by a competitor.  the bank is saved by the government following dramatic round-the-clock consultations by leaders from the governing political parties.  the funds required for this purpose are obtained by a tax levied on the non-drinkers.<p>finally an explanation i understand...	2009-03-17 14:59:19 UTC	1	2	4

4374215	ask hn: why is tech recruiting broken?	nowadays it is almost cliche' to hear both startups and mid/large size companies in the software industry complain about how hard it is to find good technical people. i want to understand why, so please indulge me.<p>the developer's perspective is easy to figure out, we've all heard that one: company's mission is not exciting, the goal isn't clear, i'm being promised .1% equity of something that will likely be worth $0 anyway, tools are boring, doesn't let me telecommute, the pay isn't high enough, the location is unfavorable and much much more..<p>what about the company's perspective though? if you've ever recruited for a company, then please share your opinion from the trenches.<p>what's the key problem here? it's my understanding that most startups receive hundreds, if not more, applications weekly. you have access to wonderful resources such as angel.co/talent, github jobs and stackoverflow jobs with hundreds of verified quality developers on there. recruiters, if you can afford them, will try to poach quality developers from other gigs for you. these days even vcs will talent scout for you! once again, what's the issue?<p>thank you!	2012-08-13 01:27:39 UTC	4	17	0

4095479	why c is a great language	alexander stepanov, the primary designer and implementer of the c++ standard template library (stl), gave an interview to dr.dobb's journal back in 1995, sharing his insightful view on 'why c is a great language' (http://www.stepanovpapers.com/drdobbs-interview.html):<p>"let's consider now why c is a great language. it is commonly believed that c is a hack which was successful because unix was written in it. i disagree. over a long period of time computer architectures evolved, not because of some clever people figuring how to evolve architectures---as a matter of fact, clever people were pushing tagged architectures during that period of time---but because of the demands of different programmers to solve real problems. computers that were able to deal just with numbers evolved into computers with byte-addressable memory, flat address spaces, and pointers. this was a natural evolution reflecting the growing set of problems that people were solving. c, reflecting the genius of dennis ritchie, provided a minimal model of the computer that had evolved over 30 years. c was not a quick hack. as computers evolved to handle all kinds of problems, c, being the minimal model of such a computer, became a very powerful language to solve all kinds of problems in different domains very effectively. this is the secret of c's portability: it is the best representation of an abstract computer that we have. of course, the abstraction is done over the set of real computers, not some imaginary computational devices. moreover, people could understand the machine model behind c. it is much easier for an average engineer to understand the machine model behind c than the machine model behind ada or even scheme. c succeeded because it was doing the right thing, not because of at&#38;t promoting it or unix being written with it."	2012-06-11 16:38:31 UTC	7	4	1

2171418	ask hn: how do you read hacker news?	when i want to read both the article and the hn comments (and without losing my place on the hn front page), i usually resort to some mess of opening links in new tabs and end up with 25 tabs and 3 windows... there's gotta be a better ui, right? this is like hotmail, which works for a lot of people -- but i want gmail.	2011-02-02 18:35:20 UTC	8	3	0

1608649	ask hn: which user engagement tactics have you tested personally.. 	..and which were obvious to make a difference.<p>at the site that i work the following things made a measurable impact on the traffic, user retention and user engagement:<p>1) make content shareable with social networking sites. a year after we implemented this our daily uniques increased by over 70% and social networks generate now almost 50% of the traffic.<p>2) create badges for user achievements. after the introduction of badges the amount of user generated content doubled in a month.<p>3) create a weekly newsletter to registered users who have not visited the site for a week. this is not as clear cut but after this was introduced the number of daily logins have increased by about 10% (could be a measurement error though).<p>4) make the site load faster.<p>..and which did not make any apparent impact or made surprisingly small one:<p>1) running banner campaigns asking visitors to register. registration numbers didn't budge - maybe our banners sucked.<p>2) a feature allowing users to follow the content created by other users ala twitter. a few are really using this feature - maybe we had crappy implementation.<p>3) an invite functionality where users can invite their friends to register at the site. only 5% of daily registrations come from this feature - i was expecting more.<p>just in case you are curious, these experiments were conducted at: spoki.lv	2010-08-16 18:21:16 UTC	15	2	2

5417644	show hn: cure sleep problem through online classes	dr. jocelyn sze is teaching a free online sleep class. dr. sze, has a phd from uc berkeley in clinical psychology, and specializes in sleep problems. while working at the va she created programs that helped veterans with decades of sleep difficulties recover. you can sign-up for the class here:	3
www.dobetter.com/sleep<p>here's how the class works. most people who have sleeping problems have lots of habits that cause them to associate bed and nighttime with wakefulness. these include:	2
watching tv right before bed	0
spending hours in bed trying to fall asleep unsuccessfully	0
taking a nap late in the day making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep at night<p>this class helps you break those habits and create better ones. through weekly 20 minute video lectures, jocelyn will explain what those habits are, how they cause your sleeping problems and help you set better habits around sleep by tracking your sleep schedule and making changes to it so that you can fall asleep when you go to bed.	0
these methods have been validated in a variety of studies going back 20 years. more recently a study of an online program like ours done at the university of virginia showed that 73% of people with moderate to severe insomnia no longer had any insomnia at the end of program.[1] (this approach is known as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in the research literature)<p>the class starts on march 25, this monday. we are only taking 100 more students so sign-up soon if you are interested.<p>curious to get comments as well as signups, we're working on some other courses (with professors from harvard medical school) and are eager to hear about people's thoughts about the class model in health.<p>[1] http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=483124	2013-03-21 18:28:10 UTC	2	0	0

(3 months free)	hey guys, lurker here.<p>i am doing my masters dissertation this summer and looking for topics. i've got a host of things i want to do but i need to put them into context, 'just because its interesting' doesn't cut the mustard. plus any code i wright the university owns copyright to so id rather keep my pet projects for my personal time.<p>if anyone is at a company that has a real world problem that they would like looking into but just don't have the time then perhaps i could help! i have 3+ full time months allocated to this so there should be some good results at the end.<p>i work in java mainly and do a lot with databases (sql &#38; nosql stuff), but i'm not one to say no to something i don't fully know yet.<p>if anyone is interested please drop me an e-mail.<p>thanks<p>henry.	2011-02-16 15:48:38 UTC	5	4	4

1058482	ask hn: quality (open preferred) book indexing software?	i have two walls of bookshelves filled with books i've collected over the years. i'm a bit of a book hoarder, so any subject i come across that i find interesting usually ends up with a book purchased. i have well over five hundred at this point.<p>problem is, our house is rather small, and my wife is interested in reclaiming her breakfast room (aka my office).<p>ideally, diybookscanner.org would be farther along and i'd scan them all to files. i'd give just about anything to have digital versions of all these books. sadly, i don't think it's possible or feasible in my time frame.<p>so, i play to buy a shed, place my books in plastic, labeled bins, and store them away. the problem is, i'm a technologist and developer, and i can never be sure what books i'll need on a given night. i think i can keep a 5-10 book rotation going and be ok, but i need to be able to find and retrieve the books quickly.<p>years ago, when i had a few of the misguided but cool cuecats, there were a few projects out there to let you scan a book's bar code, retrieve its data from amazon, and store it in a database. i'm hoping some of you can point me to similar solutions today. ideally, it'll let me scan the barcode, retrieve and store the book's data, and tag it in certain ways (bin a, bin b, etc). it'd also have decent search capabilities.<p>finally, i'll need either a way to use my iphone as the barcode reader itself, or suggestions for an affordable reader i can purchase.<p>thanks for any help you can provide!	2010-01-17 14:56:55 UTC	1	0	0

2- more weak (security) = more attacks<p>i acknowledge is necessary a sufficient # of targets with enough value to sustain this behaviors, but think that is possible to have a more secure system, no matter how popular and that the increase on numbers will not yield a increase on insecurity.<p>however, that is my intuition. exist a solid proof?	2012-12-27 22:51:47 UTC	1	0	3

1463948	are any startups in sf (city primarily) interviewing? (ror)	i'm spending this upcoming entire week in san francisco and would love to speak to startups that are looking to hire for a rails engineer position.<p>to briefly summarize my experience - i've developed two rails sites (personal projects) from the ground up, their design (css/xhtml), look, implementation (ror,jquery,pgsql), and deployment(nginx/mongrel_cluster). i absolutely enjoy getting my feet wet in all aspects of web dev and wearing as many hats as humanly possible. i would rate myself as an intermediate-level rails developer who gets things done. if i don't know something, i love spending the time learning it. i've been doing ror all in my spare time for the past 1.5+ years.<p>in my day job, i've been building large-scale, distributed software systems in c for 5+ years. it's pretty cool stuff that i have loved doing but want to switch to more consumer-facing, web applications development now.<p>not sure if such posts are frowned upon but not being from the bay area, it is difficult to get startups to interview you. my email is in my bio page and i'd be happy to mail you my resume.	2010-06-26 17:21:52 UTC	1	0	4

2565550	ask hn: want your site/blog to be featured in our new app?	hi hn,<p>our new app, blogfire, is an rss reader with push notifications. the app comes pre-packaged with a set of sites/blogs that people can subscribe to so they don't open the app to just a blank screen. we submitted to apple last week and were rejected today because we need to have written permission from all of the pre-packaged blogs in order to use their names and images in the app.<p>of course, trying to get permission from such sites would be a long, horrible process, so we are looking to replace these sites with ones we can get permission from quickly.<p>here is a screenshot of what the app looks like on initial launch:<p>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/960396/screenshots/blogfire.png<p>the user can re-arrange/edit the list to their liking by adding/removing sites.<p>if you own/write a blog and would like to be featured as part of the pre-packaged sites in the app, and you are willing to give written permission to that effect, please email me at chad@jazzychad.net with "blogfire" in the subject line. also include a link to an image/icon/avatar i can use for the site in the app.<p>this would be a great opportunity to get your blog featured in a shiny new app and potentially increase your readership. the app is free and has some viral sharing components, so we hope it will spread like, well, wildfire.<p>also, if you are connected with any of the blogs in the screenshot and would be able to help get permission from them, please email me as well.<p>thanks! -chad, chad@jazzychad.net<p>edit: in your email, please also include a link to an image i can use for your site... preferably square at least 48x48	2011-05-19 22:09:12 UTC	41	8	4

4932271	ask hn: *absolute beginners* guide to javascript	hi guys,<p>as the title suggests, i am after the absolute, most introductory, basic and low-level resources for learning js. assume i know nothing <i>at all</i>.<p>i recently picked up a copy of _javascript: the good parts_ but that still assumes some prior knowledge. i am from a design and css background, but if i were to rank my js on a 1–10 scale i’d say it’s a firm zero.<p>are there any books that have stood the test of time? a decent series of blog posts? i’m wanting to learn about core programming/scripting stuff, rather than ‘how to make xyz with js’, so any resources that introduce js as a language rather than a ‘look what you can do with js’ would be superb. i want to ‘get’ js, not just use it.<p>i appreciate this is a very demanding question, and one you no doubt get all the time, but: where would someone with zero js knowledge look to start learning how to do js properly. i would also assume i’d need to do some language-agnostic learning too, about core programming principles…?<p>thanks so much for any/all advice and insight!	3

84075	idea: paypal for identity management	someone might have thought this up already, but if they haven't, this might be an interesting project for someone to do. basically, the idea is to make the equivalent of paypal, but for identity management.<p>for most sites, authentication consists of an e-mail / password combo. some require you to create a user-name as well, but it's basically a proxy for an e-mail address. the problem is -- a lot of people don't really want to give out their e-mail address. (1) spam. (2) linking multiple accounts to the same e-mail provides lots of info for data-miners.<p>to deal with 1, many users already create junk-mail accounts that exist for the sole purpose of signing up for stuff. the problem is that sometimes you want to see some of the newsletters those sites send. leaving them all in the junk account ensures they're buried under all the other stuff. use your non-junk-mail account and you may not be able to undo the damage later (ever try opting-out of some of the spam messages? pita sometimes). it also doesn't solve 2.<p>so .. why not create different e-mail addresses for each site you create an account with? have them all forward to your real e-mail address. when you no longer want spam from a certain source, simply terminate one of the fake e-mail addresses. this would be a pain for a user to do for every single account they created, but an entrepreneurial hacker could create a service that automatically generated fake e-mail addresses, strong passwords, set up any forwarding, and allowed users to track and manage their login info on multiple sites. you would also have to write a browser plugin or something that looked for user-name/e-mail form fields and filled in the proper login info (it'd be unreasonable to expect users to keep track of all the fake e-mail addresses on their own).<p>just as paypal allows you to pay without exposing your actual financial information, this would allow you to login without exposing your actual e-mail address. even better, unlike paypal or services like openid and windows cardspace, it requires no change on the part of the actual sites themselves. it's all done on the client-side.<p>for the truly paranoid, you could potentially extend the idea by creating full-blown fake identities (with names, addresses, etc.) for each site you visited, but i suspect you would run afoul of the law here.<p>there's a lot of room of abuse, but i don't see any absolute deal-breakers so far. i'm busy with my own project right now, so if someone's looking for something to do, go for it.	2007-11-28 00:10:27 UTC	3	2	0
8995352	ask hn: is learning cobol a good idea	i&#x27;m currently tossing around the idea of learning cobol. the reason this has been on my mind is because its a very very old language. it seems that it has long since been out of the lime light for a long time but, many companies still use old legacy cobol code. as the years go on i feel cobol will become more and more in demand as many younger developers and students are no longer bothering to learn it but there are still systems running it and there are still people who are paid quite will to maintain it.<p>what does hn think?	2015-02-04 04:45:05 UTC	3	2	4

3637039	i just downloaded my entire google web history (300k). 	i've always used the search history as a power user tool since it allowed me to search within my searches and locate information that way. i'm a heavy google user, my search history has over 300k searches. but i don't want google to access this information for advertising. i'm already annoyed enough because it's constantly bothering me with costa rica vacation information since i did a bit of research on that country several weeks ago. so i decided i'd stop using the web history. i still want to access the accumulated data though. i found this script which automatically downloads the google history as a csv file.<p>http://geeklad.com/updated-script-to-download-google-history<p>however, this code is somehow executed on the developers server, so there're some privacy issues here (god knows whether your history is being saved there). so i set out to code a ruby script to download my web history.<p>https://github.com/terhechte/google-web-history-downloader<p>this works only for around 4k of entries though. it would be more work in order to support downloading the entire history, for that either fork the script or use the script mentioned above<p>i used the geeklad script above instead of my ruby script, but i figured i'd share my ruby approach nontheless so somebody can improve on it.<p>cheers.	2012-02-26 22:39:49 UTC	9	0	1
