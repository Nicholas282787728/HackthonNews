5313936	backbone: subviews, default “div” wrapper and delegated events	hi!!<p>we are trying a solution with backbone and subviews, and after several days we are blocked in the same point. is the next:<p>for example, we have two backbone views: a parent view (personview) and its subview (locationview). their templates, in mustache notation, are the next:<p>* personview template:<p><pre><code>    &#60;h2&#62;{{fullname}}&#60;/h2&#62;	1
&#60;div&#62;	2
&#60;h3&#62;address:&#60;/h3&#62;	4
{{{location}}}	2
&#60;/div&#62;	3
</code></pre>	4
* locationview template:<p><pre><code>    &#60;h4&#62;places:&#60;h4/&#62;	2
&#60;dl&#62;	3
&#60;dt&#62;city:&#60;/dt&#62;	3
&#60;dd&#62;{{city}}&#60;/dd&#62;	4
&#60;dt&#62;place:&#60;/dt&#62;	0
&#60;dd&#62;{{place}}&#60;/dd&#62;	4
&#60;/dl&#62;	4
</code></pre>	3
note that these templates does not have a parent element; so, backbone will asignate them the "div" element by default in the "el" property.<p>in personview's "render" method, how can we add the locationview's rendered html into "personview.el" without loossing locationview's events and without adding the deafult wrapping "div" element of "locationview.el"?<p>if we remove de subview's "el" property, we always loose the events (in the subviews), but if we keep that "el", then we have problems if we want to associate it with jquery events :-(<p>anybody has any solution about this?	0
many thanks in advance.	3

1910516	develop in java your native iphone / ipad apps	flexycore (www.flexycore.com) is a french company founded in 2008 by java experts from texas instruments and inria (french research center). with ispectrum, they provide a full java 1.5 compliant solution that allows you to develop in java and debug native iphone/ipod touch/ipad application using eclipse ide.<p>note that  to compile and obtain an iphone binary application or an iphone simulator binary application, you must have installed the iphone sdk on a mac os x (intel only) and use flexycore ispectrum on this system to be fully compliant with the apple legacy.<p>in one click, you install ispectrum plugin and turn eclipse into a java development environment for iphone. no need to install a jvm, but compiles your java app to native code with ispectrum!<p>ispectrum provides access to iphone native apis (ui, gps, accelerometers...) in java and enables developers to design powerful iphone applications in java. thanks to its complementary apis (j2me like, core android) an existing j2me application can be realized and ported quickly.	4
note also that ispectrum directly drives/controls xcode so you can use the iphone sdk simulator to debug your application from eclipse!<p>there is free edition for open source project	2010-11-16 16:15:10 UTC		1	1

6095560	help save kids, feature request for all navigation app developers.	over the past few weeks there have been more and more reports of children being forgotten, and dying, in the back seats of cars. being the father of several young children and a busy ceo, i find these reports both disturbing and frightening. i couldn&#x27;t even imagine the grief of a parent who realised that his&#x2f;her preoccupation with the hectic schedule&#x2f;job&#x2f;startup caused the death of their child.<p>i am an app developer,so i started kicking around some ideas of how i could build something to help solve, or at least reduce the occurrence of, this problem. while i try to think of a way that i can have an impact using my skills, i thought it may be worth starting a discussion about the issue and sending out a general feature request to all app developers that create navigation&#x2f;car related apps.<p>the feature would be one (or both) of the following:<p>1. upon arrival to destination, in addition to the &quot;you have arrived!&quot; message, also speak a reminder to check for backseat passengers&#x2f;babies.<p>2. send a &quot;push notification&quot; message between 5 to 10 minutes after arriving at destination, with a polite reminder about potential backseat passengers.<p>i just sent an email to waze asking them to add this in, not sure how far that will get, but had to try.<p>i welcome any discussion, suggestions, ideas or collaboration on building something that would save even one child.<p>and for all you parents with startups, check the backseat every time you leave the car. every time.	2013-07-24 11:42:47 UTC		1	2

7613114	learning and yet making same mistakes again	hi all,<p>we learned a hard lesson with our first startup, healthworldweb and while the startup was sold, we only grew to about 1,000 users over almost 3 years for many reasons. main reason is that we did not have a geo-focus and ended up with a “sparsity and scarcity” problem of doctor reviews on our site. the social matching technology was interesting enough for the acquirer!<p>a ~year ago, we decided to build q! – http:&#x2f;&#x2f;questiongr.am - the main premise is that it is still difficult to find the right information at the right time and search engines are not cutting it anymore. i want information now, i don&#x27;t have time to search and research and because we all live across many social networks all of our friends and followers has expertise in many different areas: from movies to health.<p>so we had a dilemma once again, just like with the last business - do we focus on particular vertical and geo-location or go wide and see what the market brings.<p>well, once again we decided to go wide and for full transparency, we launched the app in the apple app store in october ( ~400 dl). we followed with android in dec with now (~200 dl) and now windows (6 dl – ha) to be the only cross-platform social search but all of this currently is not yielding results.<p>we brought on a marketing person and in the last 3 months got some nice mentions but purposely staying away form the big techcrunch &amp; etc because we want to grow &quot;dedicated&quot; users who believe in the world of social intelligence.<p>we launched a kickstarter campaign - http:&#x2f;&#x2f;kck.st&#x2f;1hht3n6 -(20 days ago), to find these believers who can help us shape the product and provide feedback. we got a few for sure, but we now have 8 days to go with only 7% funding reached.<p>would love to hear people’s thoughts on growing a following for q! – is the message clear, is our mission clear, is the broad approach the right way to go!<p>thanks!	2014-04-19 10:33:40 UTC		1	0

4555838	ask hn: gof design patterns and dynamic languages	hello -	1
excuse me if this question is elementary, but it is something that i would like to get a better understanding about in order to be able to code more properly/etc.<p>if i understand correctly, the gof design patterns were originally created to address some limitations with the object oriented approach used by java at the time (please correct me if i am mistaken).<p>is it true that dynamic languages address this limitation to some extent and thereby reduce or eliminate the need for the use of some of these patterns?<p>specifically, my questions are:	2
* in a language like ruby for example, do you find yourself using gof patterns or does the fact that the language has functional aspects/duck-typing/etc. reduce/eliminate the need to use these patterns?	0
* if the above is true, are there new patterns that you find yourself using?	1
* if one is starting with dynamic languages today, is learning/mastering these gof patterns still a requirement?<p>my intention of course is not at all to create an argument about this topic, but rather to learn how to best approach learning programming now in 2012, specifically with dynamic languages in mind (such as ruby and coffeescript, for example).<p>furthermore, i am not a cs student and have been teaching myself programming over the years (started out with scripting for system admin purposes but gradually became interested in programming/development itself).  being self-taught has its virtues and limitations.  one such limitation perhaps is the fact that i may have missed out on some of the important teachings such as these gof patterns in a classroom setting/etc.<p>thank you for your time.	2012-09-21 21:13:51 UTC		1	2

1636881	exercises in understanding your target market. (my first attempt.)	i'm working on my first proper entrepreneurial venture. ("proper" meaning check the market, see what the demand is, being building mvp based on positive results, etc as opposed to build first and cross fingers.) the planned product is a hybrid between personal crm and contact/profile/id management service. currently, i have a very good idea about my value proposition, my potential channels, how to monetize my idea... however i still have a big question mark for my targeted market.<p>to remedy this, i've put together a very basic and simple survey with the objective of identifying which features i should focus on in my mvp, understanding the frustrations of my potential users and trying to understand various workflows as it relates to how they might use my product.<p>so i humbly approach your collective expertise and ask if you wouldn't mind critiquing my survey (and maybe filling it out, too?) or helping me identify oversights in my approach. as a small token of appreciation, i will gladly share the results if anyone is interested.<p>thanks so much! i'm learning a lot from this community and happy to have this resource available.<p>survey link: http://www.survs.com/survey/ct3a9q3xgx	2010-08-26 19:21:50 UTC		2	4

3100657	ask hn: how do i legally convert virtual money to "real" money?	"5. prohibited businesses ... (45) virtual currency that can be monetized, re-sold or converted to physical or digital goods or services or otherwise exit the virtual world." - https://stripe.com/tos<p>i understand that this is about laws regarding money laundering and funding terrorism and all that "evil stuff which we need to stop at any cost" nonsense. however, this position, of automatically disallowing the conversion of virtual money to "real" money, effectively makes impossible a viable online economy, and that's simply because people would not be allowed to extract money which they earned through work which benefited an online community.<p>hypothetically, i create yet another clone of flickr. my clone's claim to fame is that searching, based on user-generated tags, is exceptionally accurate. this accuracy is due to users being unusually motivated to provide numerous and correct tags for their own pictures, as well as for those of other users. the reason for this motivation is that they are being paid, per tag, in my virtual currency. also, they are careful with details because inaccuracy costs them money. the whole thing is kind of like hn's karma, but with real value added.<p>they can then use that money to purchase more bandwidth for their own pictures, to trade with other users for favors, or for whatever other reason which makes sense within the economy of my flickr clone. so, someone without a credit card can earn, through real and useful work, the same kind of benefits that those who do have credit cards, but who do not put in any work for the benefit of the community. now, what if some people wanted to put in so much effort that they would start to earn significant money? due to these laws, those people are stuck, because they can never withdraw that virtual money, in the form of "real" money.<p>i could have two forms of virtual currency, one which came from credit cards, and one which was wholly generated by my system, but then lazy people, with credit cards, wouldn't be able to pay those without credit cards, to generate tags for them. other thoughts i've had only serve to add even more complexity. i would like to hear ideas on how to solve this problem without violating laws or the credit card processor's tos because, to me, it's obvious that the next level of social websites must have the ability to give users more power than simply generating content, and that this power should be in the form of a real economy.	2011-10-11 22:28:16 UTC		2	0

9915613	ask hn: mvp ticketing micro service marketing and kickstarting	inspired by joe armstrong&#x27;s post on minimal viable programs, i wanted to see if i could learn a bit of bootstrapping and marketing experience by trying to create a very basic trouble ticketing system.  i suppose you could use github for tickets, and maybe there are other existing solutions that make this moot.  if there is something that obviates the need for this please call it out.  below is a very basic api i was experimenting with.<p>the ticket (in elixir) would be something like<p><pre><code>    defstruct [:id, :title, :description, :creator, :owner, :created_at, :updated_at, :read_at, :label	3
	4
new(creator.id) :: ticket # creates a blank ticket	1
new(creator.id,ticket) :: ticket # creates a ticket with	4
update(updater.id,ticket) :: ticket #	3
close(updater.id,ticket.id) :: true|false #sets status to closed	2
get(ticket.id) :: ticket #  returns a ticket	4
transfer(ticket, new_owner.id) :: ticket # transfers ownership of a ticket	0
</code></pre>	0
the next obvious step is to put authentication and relations in front of this very basic system.<p><pre><code>    new_user	1
list(user)	0
list(user,status: :open|:closed)	3
history(user)	4
assign(user.id,ticket.id)	0
</code></pre>	4
then a stretch funding goal could be setup for a web gui, and mobile app.<p>wondering if this is something i could launch via kickstarter and say offer 10k tickets and 50 users for the first year for  $20 in funding?  i&#x27;ve been in b2b enterprise sales for many years.  i&#x27;ve never attempted to do any direct marketing, and i&#x27;m looking for somewhere or something to cut my teeth a bit.<p>is joe right that this is too much of a mvp to fund in a kickstarter way?	4
has there been success with launching micro services via kickstarter?	0
if trouble tickets isn&#x27;t the &quot;thing&quot;, what micro service would you fund?	1
if you would like to collaborate on this with me, please let me know.  i plan on using elixir to implement.	2015-07-20 12:50:33 UTC		3	1

3998917	are files ready to change?	some of david gelernter's oft quoted file ideas:<p>"modern computing is based on an analogy between computers and file cabinets that is fundamentally wrong and affects nearly every move we make. (we store "files" on disks, write "records," organize files into "folders" — file-cabinet language.) computers are fundamentally unlike file cabinets because they can take action."<p>"our standard policy on file names has far-reaching consequences: doesn't merely force us to make up names where no name is called for; also imposes strong limits on our handling of an important class of documents — ones that arrive from the outside world. a newly-arrived email message (for example) can't stand on its own as a separate document — can't show up alongside other files in searches, sit by itself on the desktop, be opened or printed independently; it has no name, so it must be buried on arrival inside some existing file (the mail file) that does have a name. the same holds for incoming photos and faxes, web bookmarks, scanned images..."<p>"you shouldn't have to put files in directories. the directories should reach out and take them. if a file belongs in six directories, all six should reach out and grab it automatically, simultaneously."<p>"a file should be allowed to have no name, one name or many names. many files should be allowed to share one name. a file should be allowed to be in no directory, one directory, or many directories. many files should be allowed to share one directory. of these eight possibilities, only three are legal and the other five are banned — for no good reason."<p>it begs the question if files and the core systems on which they are read/stored are ready to change?  and will it be a start-up that makes the leap, or a lonely computer scientist who has no stake in the market?<p>http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_index.html	2012-05-20 14:57:19 UTC		3	3

2648089	ask hn: thoughts on a hidden "meta" comment view?	i recently gained the ability to downvote comments, and i've been trying to take this (light) responsibility seriously.  so far, the only comments that i have downvoted were those that i felt obviously did not add anything to the discussion.<p>as i downvoted one such comment, i had an urge to reply to it with an explanation of why i chose to do so.  of course, my explanation would not add anything to the discussion either, so i refrained.<p>it occurs to me that something like a normally hidden meta-chat view might be helpful.  by default, none of the meta discussion would be visible, but a user could choose to view it.  it would be a place for discussing the discussion, explaining site guidelines, etc.  i think of it as sort of analogous to wikipedia's discussion tab.<p>my idea here is that such a meta-chat view might help get crufty comments off the main view, as well as encourage more communication about <i>why</i> a comment is inappropriate.  another idea might be to allow comments to be voted into the meta category, so they would be hidden from the main view but still visible to those who care.<p>have any other communities tried this sort of thing?  what do you think of it?	2011-06-13 04:07:00 UTC		3	1

next you need to define what consonants are and create a list	0
if user input contains any of the letters defined in the list (regardless of case) place an &#x27;o&#x27; after the specific letter and add the consonant	4
return to above command and check for any other characters, once every character is checked return new output and exit.<p>---<p>but for some reason i just hit a blank wall and can&#x27;t apply this to python, it&#x27;s as if i learn the syntax but not problem solving, or its like i haven&#x27;t really learned programming. any advice at all would be appreciated as i really want to start being able to do interesting stuff!	2015-05-09 07:03:27 UTC		4	0

3667924	ask hn: non-compete: how do i prove when i started a project?	i have a project i've been working on for about a year in my personal time (weekends, nights, etc) when not at work.  it's basically a game.  i was planning to launch this on the web at some point in the coming few months, and later on in the app store/android market if possible.  so, the thing is, i just received a job offer from a large tech company and i'd like to accept.  they will ask me to sign a non-compete (it's legal where they are).  but the problem is that, unlike my previous company, this company is in many different lines of business, including games.  so there is overlap there.  i have been reading up on non-competes and it looks like they are non-enforcable unless the company can demonstrate that confidential information/trade secrets was actually stolen and used to help the competitor in question.	0
so the thing is, most of the code for this project is already written.  but if the game became popular and they came after me, how would i prove that?  it's not open source so i can't point to a github commit history or anything like that.  do courts look at modification dates/times on files?    i realize this probably paranoid, i doubt this company is going to come after me for my hobby iphone app or whatever.  however i'm just wondering if anyone has any insight into what i should do in this situation.  (also, i won't actually be working in the games division itself, if that makes any difference).  thanks hn.	2012-03-05 19:28:06 UTC		4	0

2494405	ask hn: what should i do?	(i'm posting anonymously, for obvious reasons.)<p>i joined a very small company 3 weeks ago. they sell a bunch of stuff online, particularly electronics. the implementation of the site is horrible, but it works and gets around 10k unique users per day. they are paying me around $15,000 above the south florida market for an experienced software engineer, which is the same i was making in my previous company. (the south florida market sucks, by the way.)<p>i joined this company because it looked like it was a great opportunity to have a tremendous impact on a business (and also because i hate working for big corporations). i want to take this company to the next level and make it something like zappos. something cool. ten thousand unique users per day is a lot of traffic to start with, so i feel that i have a lot of power in my hands.<p>the problem: i’m the only engineer. basically, everything technical in this company is in my hands. the website sucks and i concluded that it has to be rebuilt from scratch. i also have to work on little projects that the owners need now, that are directly linked to profits. i still haven’t figured out an approach to rebuilt the site while it’s working (remember it’s horrible and i’m not talking about the ui: nothing is designed in the backend. things seem to have emerged spontaneously as if by mutations and natural selection) but my gut feeling tells me that it would take me at least a year. so, the combination of what i have in front of me, my ambitious goals, and my “loneliness” make me feel somewhat overwhelmed.<p>i need ideas. help me think. what should i do?	2011-04-28 18:16:18 UTC		5	1

270059	ask yc: need a bit of advice, fellow student is screwing me over on this website.	i confess to being a total moron for not getting anything in writing.<p>anyway: i was offered $500 to write a database-backed web app and missed one deadline they gave me. there were a couple occasions where i said i hoped to have it done soon, but didn't. anyway, they never specificed exactly what they wanted, so i pushed out a functional version that had the general aesthetic they wanted, figuring that i could add in other changes once they played around with it a bit. i also had to pay about $300 in hosting, since their hosting wasn't set up to serve anything more than static html.<p>because they think i missed "several" deadlines and the site wasn't what they were imagining, they now want to pay me only $500, instead of $500 plus hosting. effectively, only $200 for my work. my question: should i bargain or just take their new offer, or take down the site? i'm considering bargaining, because the guy's part of an organization, and i'd like the rest of the members to hear my side. what i was thinking was to cc the other person i know in their organization with a defense and a request for the full amount. thoughts?<p>edit: i can cancel the hosting within the next couple weeks and get that money back, so keeping the code and walking away doesn't hurt me financially.	2008-08-07 22:02:34 UTC		5	3

2428846	why the "why not" message hurts	as my first experience with applying to yc, i just received the why not (rejection) email.<p>above everything, after researching a lot for the past month or so on the ycombinator funding and application process, i fell in love with the aura of its community.	4
as something yc itself didn't expect, this community is probably a golden by-product that is worth a lot more than their actual ownership in the startups they fund(1).<p>information on how to make money (no matter how difficult) is much better than direct access to money(2). even though supposedly the goal of most applicants is money, i would estimate there are a lot that would just give a portion of their company as a membership fee in order to join the yc process and community.<p>i am not surprised with my reaction to the "rejection" as funding was of secondary importance to me, and that's why it hurts.	1
i do not wan't to join or create another yc reject group, i wan't yc to keep doing what they're doing and try again.<p>you can find the equivalent money anywhere, but you cannot find the equivalent yc aura.<p>(1) just how i feel - its hard to make this estimation on paper.	1
(2) this goes for those who admire the yc process more than the monetary funding they receive.	2011-04-10 04:55:22 UTC		6	1

2539148	ask hn: how do you write clean node.js code?	i'm working on a smallish node.js + sproutcore app now, and i'm noticing that my node.js code has gotten really ugly, really quickly as my app has grown.<p>the most common cause of ugliness so far has been db queries. every time i want to access a db, i have to do something to the effect of:<p>userdb.get(uid, function(err,doc){	3
if(err){	2
// log error	3
}	0
// do something with doc	3
});<p>this is fine on a small scale, but as my app grows, it gets really hard to read the code. what if i have 5 db queries? that is 5 levels of indentation, and a lot of extra code. i would imagine the above being written in ruby + rails as:<p>userdata = users.find(:uid =&#62; uid)<p>which results in no indentation, and is very easy to follow.<p>the most common solution i've heard to this is "well, just use named functions!" this seems to produce even uglier code: because functions have to be declared <i>before</i> i can use them, i have to declare the business logic in reverse order. this means that i have to read code "backwards" to get the linear flow! and, in my experience, each named function does little more than execute a db query.<p>it almost seems like this problem could be resolved with a little syntactic sugar:<p>userdb.get(uid) -&#62; (err, res)	1

1654961	ask hn: your feedback applied to blurrypeople.com. is it better?	a week ago i asked the hn-community for feedback on our website (blurrypeople: a site that lets you meet strangers via your webcam, http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1626783). and feedback i got! thoughtful, honest and just very useful feedback. i was really, really, impressed: hn truly is a unique community.<p>of course, we acted on just about all of the feedback:<p>- you said the dark color scheme wouldn't appeal to women. so we changed the colors.<p>- you said the tagline didn't try enough to explain the purpose. we changed it to: "meet awesome strangers".<p>- many of you were lost on first visit - "what are we supposed to do here?". so we introduced an introduction.<p>- and most importantly: nobody seemed to understand the feedback system. neither did we, actually. we replaced it with something that is -or so we hope- both more intuitive and more powerfull. it's based on users collecting 'awesomeness'. you get it when people rate you as 1) friendly, 2) interesting, or 3) good looking. the more awesome you are, the more the system allows you to apply filtering when searching for (awesome!) strangers. more control.<p>so, what do you think? is it better this way, or did we mess it up even worse? ;)<p>again, thanks a lot for all of your feedback! it is much appreciated.<p>http://www.blurrypeople.com	2010-09-02 01:40:50 UTC		10	2

2187183	ask hn: getting over the web design wall?	i'm an accomplished coder and techie. i have developed large, intricate systems that i consider beautiful when gazed upon from afar. i've developed successful software, both on the desktop and on the interwebs. i have kept many companies afloat with my aptitude, skill and energy. i have held positions that run the gamut, from lowly "client/server programmer" to cio of a company of over 4000. i've rails it. i've djangoed it. i php'd it in the php3 days when it wasn't really cool. i perl'd it before that, and c'd it even further back. heck, i've even developed complex web apps in tcl. how many of you can say that? ;-)<p>these days, i'm doing a lot of my own projects, on the web, trying to gain some traction. however, with each new project, i hit a wall that i can't seem to get around...i can't for the life of me design a webpage that <i>looks</i> decent. it's completely frustrating and debilitating...and i have to surpass it.<p>i'm confident other hn'ers have had this sort of block and made there way over it or around it. would you mind sharing your insights? what books, tutorials, or templates made the difference? when you start a new web project, what do you start with in terms of ui infrastructure?<p>thanks for any advice you can offer.	2011-02-07 01:53:24 UTC		11	0

225858	ask yc: a magazine that publishes blogs. startup potential?	i had this idea about 10 minutes ago on my way to the mailbox. since i believe that ideas aren't worth anything on their own, i submit it here to see what you guys think about its potential. here's the idea:<p>a magazine that finds interesting blogs, bundles them together (maybe with themes), and publishes them in a print magazine.<p>my thoughts on this&#62;<p>people could be exposed to new/interesting blogs that they might not find on their own. they can also read up on their favorite blogs in places that they normally wouldn't be able to (anywhere they don't want to pull their laptop out).<p>there are some pros for blog publishers too: for new and undiscovered writers they can have their blogs featured. more established writers could opt to publish with a revenue sharing model.<p>of course there are also the articles about adsense optimization, etc.<p>another variation of this idea would be a system for bloggers to have their blogs bundled up and printed in a magazine to give as a gift to their readers, similar to amateur musicians making a family and friends cd.<p>anyways, what do you guys think? is something like this even feasible? any gaping holes that i haven't even realized yet?

8614520	i have $5,500 to use for a title iv school/program	just finished up an americorps term of service and i have accumulated the standard $5,500 education award to use for title iv approved schools&#x2f;programs.<p>i have a bachelors in crim justice and a j.d. already so i thought i might want to look into using it for something online that&#x27;s cs related - but i really don&#x27;t want to spend anything more out of pocket and see if i can just get the $5,500 worth (even if it&#x27;s not a complete program).  problem is that i&#x27;ve looked at the full spectrum of classes at local approved community colleges and i&#x27;m already far past their most advanced level just having gone through several code school&#x2f;codecademy courses.<p>i would love to get more training specific to databases since that&#x27;s my weakest area currently.<p>any ideas of something i can put this toward that is 1) online 2) less than $5,500 or droppable once i max the award and 3) higher than introductory but not much higher.  it has to be a title iv program so that eliminates a lot of great workshops&#x2f;boot camps i would otherwise love to put it towards.<p>thanks for any input!	2014-11-16 16:12:18 UTC		1	2

9399397	wanted: easy to use autobackup for files&db on linux vps for non-sysadmins	i&#x27;ve totally messed up trying to find such solution.<p>data-in:	2
- i&#x27;m a full-time project manager in a small company, spending my spare time on validating various ideas for products and working as a freelancer.	4
- on validating ideas, i mean coding &amp; public launching mvp to test whether somebody else need it.	1
- i&#x27;m running a small  linux vps server with ubuntu 14.04<p>problem:	4
- i have permanent pain in the ass because of absolute absence of backups.	2
- i have github for my code but nothing for db and ugc files.	2
- snapshot solutions (which are provided by provider) do not fit my needs.	1
- as mentioned above, i have some coding skills but i&#x27;m an absolute dummy in server administration, configuring remote backups, etc. all i know is just how to run several ssh commands and how to restart my server =)<p>ask:	2
- do you know any solutions that are really easy to use for linux servers?	4
small demands: solution for linux, easy, very easy to use, remote backup (to amazon, azure, nearline or elsewhere), storage is included or easy to connect (e.g. i just have to provide my credentials for as s3), ssl, support for mysql.<p>i&#x27;ve totally messed up trying to find such solution.	2
already tried:	1
- acronis backup to cloud (too complicated and expensive for me)	0
- snapshots provided by hosting	4
- rsync (just syncs  deletion all missed files and is not easy for me :)	2
- bacula (did not understand how to use it on a server)	1
- searchув open source scripts on github but stuck due to lack of knowledge and inability to understand the code<p>hope you&#x27;ll help. if you know or just heard something about the backup solution, that you think will fit my needs i will appreciate if you post it here in comments.<p>thanks in advance!	2015-04-18 13:35:10 UTC		1	2

we are a team of two guys, i do the “technical stuff” and my partner does the billing and taxes part... that’s great and is working but the problem is that i don’t know how to code and we want to build an application for our startup.<p>the investor is the ceo of a web development company in santiago and he wants to partner with us. the deal is to have3- 5% of our company in exchange of building the application and some cash for us.<p>that’s a good deal.<p>i have thinking about this app for a while and by this point i have a lot of sketches about how the app should look and work. i just need someone to develop and the investor’s team can do this without a doubt.<p>he wants this sketches but i suppose is not a very good idea to show them without any signed contracts. he just gave us a nda to sign but i don’t know what else we must do to avoid a story like this for us:<p>http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/27/a-classic-startup-horror-story-the-ma-bait-and-switch/2/<p>we have our next meeting on thursday and i’m really in a hurry for advice about how to avoid “being screwed” by this guys… you know, i don’t want them to see the sketches, build the app and said “thanks for your cooperation guys, see you later”.<p>any advice about what steps we should follow to avoid a “horror story” situation?.	2012-02-28 15:59:17 UTC		1	1

7360332	did you actually believe yesterday that "dorian" was the real "satoshi"?	after reading the ap interview, it seems clear that:	4
1) dorian&#x27;s &quot;admission&quot; to goodman was actually just an admission that he worked on classified projects.<p>2) dorian&#x27;s written english is vastly, and provably, different than that used in satoshi bitcoin forums<p>3) his mistaken use of the term <i>&quot;bitcom&quot;</i> for <i>&quot;bitcoin&quot;</i> is further proof -- and clearly not pre-meditated herring-dropping -- that the poor guy just was the victim of newsweek&#x27;s overzealous hope that it actually had a scoop big enough to put on its resurrected print journal.<p><i>but</i> -- i foolishly just ate up and believed the whole thing.<p>anyone else?<p><pre><code>  did you believe it yesterday and now realize you were wrong?	3

5083892	be careful with those seemingly private 'share this report' links	do a google search for:<p><pre><code>  site:https://qualaroo.com/share/	2
</code></pre>	3
and you'll see what i am about to get at. that's the tl;dr.<p>my bet is that most of the owners while aware that their share urls were publicly accessible to those who have the link (&#62; qualaroo says explicitly that the url is public &#60;), they perhaps weren't intending for them to be easily accessible via google.<p>as to whether this is a problem or not? it's a  clear trade-off between convenience and privacy control and the answer may depend on the type of information being shared. while qualaroo strips ip addresses and other identifying information, i do see some personally identifying information in those results (qualaroo has no control over what its customers ask of their audience using qualaroo, or over what responses are provided).<p>i believe vendors have a duty to their customers to provide them with control  strong tools to protect their information.<p>as to how they ended up indexed by google? who knows - maybe they're getting better at indexing the deep web. either way, the vendor should have robots.txt'd this from happening.<p>i hope this was at least mildly interesting to some and at best a warning to others!	2013-01-19 17:02:06 UTC		1	0

43326	significant funding leading to worse startup outcomes?	it seems to me that if you receive significant funding and are expected to hire software engineers that you may end up with a worse result.<p>after all, these employees are not as driven as the cofounders.  even with equity, it's not the same.<p>moreover, in a place like silicon valley, there's enormous competition for highly skilled software engineers.<p>so it might be the case that having the cofounders do much of the coding may result in a better outcome.	3

3372572	ask hn: should i pursue this startup that depends on decisions of "big players"	i have this project of mine (http://welshare.com) that aggregates major social networks and provides a unified interface to them, so that power users can manage their accounts easily.<p>however, i depend on decisions by facebook, twitter and google, and that can break my idea completely. for example:<p>- twitter recently announced that they don't like other vendors writing clients for twitter (http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2011/03/twitter-tells-third-party-devs-to-stop-making-twitter-client-apps.ars).<p>- facebook had a bug (allegedly fixed now) that penalized stories posted via the api and they didn't appear on other people home streams.<p>- google+ are reluctant to provide an api (only a tiny portion so far)<p>twitter decides that i can't have anything, other than "retweet" for retweeting messages (screwing my unification), facebook may retain the penalty for 3rd parties, thus making mine disadvantaged, and google may never release a complete g+ api.<p>so my questions is: is it worth it to pursue this project?	2011-12-20 06:52:33 UTC		1	1

usually, i develop on my desktop computer. whenever i'm "on the road", i first have to configure my laptop eclipse setup - reflecting the current setup of my desktop computer (including custom views, custom hotkeys, esoteric plug-ins etc.).<p>what is your solution to the "personal (integrated) development environment on multiple machines" problem? which related problems are you facing?	2012-03-13 19:58:42 UTC		1	3

1971286	ask hn: best startup accounting software?	i'm looking for some great web-based accounting software and am coming up empty. sure, there's outright, indinero and other "accounting" services, but they don't have anywhere near the functionality for real, quickbooks-killing, accounting software. i'm talking about software a real accountant wouldn't sneeze at.<p>specifically, i need non-cash accounts to track loans/debt from investors. all the web software i find are trying to make accounting trivial by removing 95% of the functionality, leaving only checking account expense tracking. this is great for some i'm sure, but i need true "quickbooks online that doesn't suck" type of software.<p>i'm not saying online accounting software needs to be complicated, but in order to disrupt quickbooks, it needs that functionality.	2010-12-05 09:10:25 UTC		1	4

1778611	ask hn: do "idea guys" willing to learn to program have critical paths to demos?	i have "an idea" and i'd like to learn enough programming to implement it myself. for various reasons i figure i have 2 years or so to run a flag up the flagpole and see who salutes it before "the big guys" roll into the territory.  so i figure i have 1 year to devote to learning to program and 1 year of "misc." including going live, getting feedback, tweeking, etc.<p>my quesiton, for anybody that cares to answer:  knowing what you know now, what path would you take to implement the following, keeping in mind i'm starting from scratch and am just trying to build a demo, not become a professional:<p>a site where:	0
- users setup an account	3
- users can email/invite friends	1
- accounts have a variable, let's say "experience points ala wow"	0
- said variable can increase/decrease actively based on pre-outlined user behaviors	0
- said variable can increase/decrease automatically based on administrator rules	4
- users can "gift" said variables to each other (exchange)<p>on a scale of 1-5, 5 being highest:	4
- uptime: 5	1
- security: 3	4
- scalability: 4<p>the reason i ask this is my own attempts at self-education are very slowly getting me to understand things that have very little to do with what i want to put together.<p>i don't even know exactly what i should be studying and trying to ask what few programmers i know only leaves me even more confused as there seems to be very little agreement on anything, especially how exactly i should start.<p>am i just pipe-dreaming, or is there a way to focus in on the toolbag i need to build this project?  and if so, what should the toolbag look like?<p>any suggestions/books you started with/books you would recommend to someone starting out/online course etc. would be very much appreciated.<p>thanks to anybody who cares to respond.	2010-10-11 02:49:06 UTC		1	3

2342479	pg’s foresight in hindsight, almost 3 years later..	i recently re-read this post (http://ycombinator.com/ideas.html) by pg from 2008, listing ideas yc would like to fund back then. i thought it’ll be interesting to revisit and discuss what he was absolutely right about, what is still relevant today and what didn’t pan out as anticipated.	2
i realize there’s a new set of rfs’s out there, i still think this is an interesting exercise simply because the no. of startups he was right about.	3
some obvious winners:<p>2. simplified browsing: i’d say ipad fits the bill. my mother, who’s never touched a computer in her life is quiet happy browsing our pics on the ipad.<p>9. photo/video sharing: besides posterous and tumblr, there’s also instagram and picplz that have generated a lot of excitement in the area.<p>16. some form of search that depends upon design: not perfect, but this seems to the main usp of bing.<p>17. new payment methods: seems like the field is wide open but there’s been lot of activity in the area. square, zong and nfc related hype are good recent examples.<p>19. application/data hosting: there’s been a recent gold rush in this area, heroku being the poster child. as pg said, there’s room for more.<p>27. hardware/software hybrids: well, square is one good example. this is something that i’m very keen on tackling personally as i believe there are a lot of opportunities still wide open in this area.<p>would love to hear more from others..	2011-03-18 23:44:52 UTC		2	4

1846413	get involved with it	since the dawn of man, there was technology; the knowledge of how to use the tools, the techniques, the system, the methods and the procedures, they were all present since the beginning. we may not know it but even cavemen were as their definition of smart as they can be. using rocks and stones to get things done were as far the best tool they could find!<p>as we evolved, we started getting smarter and smarter, thus we used those silly old sticks and stones and made the axe. yes, we were starting to get the hang of using the axe and other tools that our great, great ancestors made, but change wasn’t far behind, we always wanted something more! from the stone age, we moved on to the industrial age; the age where the people used other people to get things done in the factories. we were by as any definition of slave workers, but notice that even in the midst of all these negativity and smog (yes, global warming was already knocking at out door that early), the evolution of technology has improved by more than ten folds! weak materials were no longer a factor for we found out that we can also use metal in exchange for other materials like wood.<p>we were doing so good, but then as the military were experimenting on what others called the computer (hello eniac!). they discovered that machines and people were being used too much that it occupied space and much effort, we wanted something better. we got the idea of eniac and developed it to what we are now using, computers. finally, we have entered the computer age, wherein everyone instead of playing in the field outside laughing and enjoying the sun, are now stuck at home using their computers for work or leisure. i remembered where before when i was about 5, playing car meant extending your arms like you were holding a wheel and creating engine sounds (vroom!), now when you say playing car, it is the super pixilated version of test drive (fun times!).<p>all the machines that were controlled by people and their silly clipboards are now using these big devices called computers where it would measure up to about 30 clipboards combined. it is a wonder when you think about it, why people would exchange clipboards and pens to computers. they didn’t even know if it was such a good idea; exchanging clipboards to computers, for the computer stage was still experimental. for those that didn’t change their crappy clipboards with papers that easily get destroyed when hit with water and their oh so ever ball pen that never lets them down, unless they start to blot then in that case, scratch what i said; boo for you, the chance to change their system was already there but they didn’t do it, so together they slowly fell like the finite words in the dictionary.<p>the computer age was a hit to the market like mc hammer’s song “you can’t touch this” except it didn’t fall the next week. offices started changing their system to computerized ones because based from feedback they can increase your performance. now when you enter work and sit down in your chair and listen carefully, you could hear people aggressively hitting their keyboards going “tick” (at least the sound wasn’t that noisy compared to the typewriter). because of the computer, companies started advancing to better and more proficient solutions and services. but because of the upgrade, they wanted to connect from all over the world, good thing they were already doing experiments on that, they called it internet. people could now start using the internet to transfer information online. as it grew, they made the www or the world wide web, we could now start hosting information in the web and other people with the right permission could access it. the www becoming the world’s biggest library really helped kids a lot in their home works, thanks to them kids became so lazy that they didn’t even need to go to the library to find answers; they would just go to their computer, access the internet, and start searching about their topic.<p>the internet was such a hit that picking up people in a bar was almost discarded in the playbook, thanks to online dating. almost every thing that could be put in the internet for easier access was put. because of the internet, the percentage of couch potato’s increased. yes, people were starting to get addicted to the internet, posting information about themselves hoping to find new friends. the words facebook, friendster or myspace may come to mind, that’s the side of the people that didn’t really care how all these were made. as for the developers, they were getting so innovated that you could track anyone from any part of the world in a click. processes that were once done by meeting the client in person was now exchanged to online systems that only require you to log on then you can do the process.<p>when people realized that a good paying job could be done at home with the help of the internet, developers started making codes simpler for normal people to understand; api’s for those that are coders but still can’t understand the code. getting involved with it or information technology is now as easy as walking. you may have a bit of a hard time at first but with time and a little help, you can become an expert (or seem like an expert). hosting websites were now in our reach, sometimes even for free. for those that continue to explore the wonder of it and get better at it may get a job in a company. they say nowadays that whoever has the best it, is ahead of the competition.<p>as an information systems student, i realized that in our faculty, there are basically three types of it people; those that are hardcore programmers, those that love to document the paper work, and those that re-use other peoples work but develop on it to make it better. see that last one? anyone can get in that field, all you need is a little knowledge of it and you can be considered an it person.<p>from the start of man, to the present, technology in many forms has been there to help us make our lives easier. now in the it age, getting involved with it seems like it isn’t really a bad idea, and it could be done easily. so why not get involved with it? who knows, you might be the one that gives another milestone after the computer age.	2010-10-29 06:43:19 UTC		2	4

2026297	ask hn:  marketing experiment	i've heard a couple different people mention blogs where they pay someone in the philippines to write content.  the blogs run adsense or something similar.  these don't bring in tons of money, but they are profitable if marketed well.<p>a friend and i found this a little ridiculous.  we wanted to give it a shot.  1) it would improve our marketing skills, and 2) it would make an interesting story.  we wanted the site to be relatively worthless, content-wise, but still be able to gather a following.<p>we came up with an idea that wasn't completely worthless though.  our blog is music recommendation service, focusing on good songs to wake up to in the morning.  revenue would be through affiliate advertising for the songs and adsense.<p>we launched our blog, wakeuptomusic.com, about 2 weeks ago and we have really struggled to attract a following.  we've focused mainly on using social media to attract followers, which hasn't brought a lot of traffic so far.<p>i wanted to ask the hn community for any ideas you might have on how to market something like this.  we're looking at some interesting ideas with twitter, like a itunes giftcard raffle, crowdsourcing posts (the post will be the top tweets about the song, instead of one we right ourselves), etc.<p>what are some standard practices in marketing a blog like this?  what are some crazy left field ideas that might work?  this is above all an experiment and an exercise, where we have an uphill battle marketing a semi-useless blog.<p>thanks!	2010-12-20 23:56:18 UTC		2	0

5711297	how do you enable payments for your startup that is not backed by a big company?	who do you use for processing online payments for your side-projects? (in europe)&#60;p&#62;i am working on a side project, that is to validate an idea i have about a product. i have a fairly good solution on how to validate my idea, without too much programming.&#60;p&#62;i believe that the only way to validate my idea, would be to ask for credit card information and process a given amount of money from my potential customers. i don't know any other way to be sure that people would be interested in a product.&#60;p&#62;so considering that the product is not yet ready, and i am about to setup a small marketing website, how do i approach a payment processing company? (recurly, spreddly, wirecard or any other payment processor in europe). i don't have any history of successful businesses, and all these companies are asking for "expected number of transactions", "expected revenue", etc. unfortunately i don't have such information.&#60;p&#62;furthermore all these companies expect a minimum payment of about 100 euros per month.&#60;p&#62;how do you enable payments for your start-ups that are not backed by thousands of euros/dollars?	2013-05-15 11:40:37 UTC		2	1

3315108	ask hn: any finance topics you're interesting in learning about?	background: my co-founder and i are in the process of preparing to launch a business around financial modeling software that we've built.  we discussed the idea of writing a book (or a series of articles) that we could give away for free on finance topics (e.g., cash flows, accounting, budgeting, npv modeling, etc.).  this would hopefully allow us to 1) provide a generally useful document to anyone who downloads it and 2) demonstrate the capabilities of our software.  i've come up with a list of topics that i plan on writing about, but thought maybe i could get some ideas from hn readers to augment my own.<p>so, are there any topics that you are interested in reading about / learning about related to finance?<p>also (on a separate, but related note): once finished with the book/articles, is it appropriate to submit it to hn?  that is, i hope (and expect) that it will be useful to anyone even if they don't use our software, but obviously one of the primary goals would be to help sell software too.<p>thanks for your feedback!	2011-12-05 16:04:41 UTC		2	1

2) amazon hadoop 1.x seems to interact better with s3 than amazon hadoop 2.x; for some reason, small-file issues that did not appear in 1.x do appear in 2.x. this is just a shot in the dark, but i believe it has something to do with the mods hinted at in http:&#x2f;&#x2f;stackoverflow.com&#x2f;questions&#x2f;16403576&#x2f;hadoop-number-of-available-map-slots-based-on-cluster-size .	4
3) users are encouraged to used the latest ami and consequently the hadoop 2.x line because they are maintained more actively; however, i find most of the elastic mapreduce documentation is a holdover from hadoop 1.x. this documentation doesn&#x27;t just require a light touch-up; much must be rewritten from scratch.	3
4) debugging costs users money, so amazon has an incentive not to help out as actively. not conspiracy theorizing, here -- just noting the obvious.	2014-08-12 17:10:15 UTC		3	0

9829361	ask hn: mobileorg seems to be dead. why is that and how to possibly revive it	mobileorg is emacs org mode for mobile. both mobileorg applications for android https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;matburt&#x2f;mobileorg-android and for ios https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;mobileorg&#x2f;mobileorg seem to be quite inactive for a long time(approximately two years counting latest releases and the majority of issues&#x2f;pr). i can&#x27;t even build mobileorg for android now because apparently the gradle version used was way too old and not supported in the current android studio, and making changes is tricky. it seems barely credible given how superior org mode is compared with other note-taking solutions out there. why the lack of interest in these projects? could it be said that the mobile app community has less of an open-source spirit than other communities? or do people just generally consider other alternatives to note-taking on mobile more convenient than org mode now? i would like to unify my note-taking experience across all platforms with org mode. but while i can contribute a few pull requests, just by myself i can hardly see enough time&#x2f;energy to implement all the necessary revamps on the mobileorg project. if one would like to try to revive a seemingly interesting project and call attention to it, what would be a common way to do it.	2015-07-04 05:38:06 UTC		3	2

(basically, we need people with the skills to counter our programmers.)  this seemed like the ideal place to find such talent.  would you be willing to help?<p>if so, please visit www.mediviewdx.com and email me so that i can reach out to you personally as we get closer.  thank you!<p>sincerely,<p>jonathon feit	2010-03-01 06:52:04 UTC		4	2

currently the first feature is highlighting of op's replies in threads. (http://d.pr/i/sizr)	0
so guys, go ahead and fork it, add features, whatever, i am open to pull requests and everything. i want it to be something we all can work on together, and be proud of.	2012-06-28 01:36:22 UTC		9	3

2) i have to think twice before buying something big online: first - when i put the money on my account, and second - when i make the real payment<p>i just spent an hour filtering the online billing records on my card for the past three years and it seems according to the records that amazon is right - they did not billed me, according to my card records. i have difficult time figuring out how this could happened, since aws billing is a monthly routine for me. every month when i receive their warning email i go to the bank put enough money into my account and then stopped receiving warning emails from them.<p>hn moment: i have read somewhere on hn, or on hn linked story long time ago that you can have one month past due before they cut you off. and i am sure it was from some ceo of famous startup company, who was explaining how you can play with startup finances by delaying your payments to amazon with a month (or this is how i understand it at the time).<p>i will talk to my bank on monday to see if they can provide my with paper billing details regrading amazon and will probably pay, but i think it is not good business practice to bill your clients 30 months later.<p>have you ever been more than a month late on aws billing. what happened?	4
what will your advice be in this situation?	2010-10-15 21:40:44 UTC		13	0

1962125	ask hn: how can banks improve their branches? 	hi,<p>my colleague recently posted this article on hn http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1906251 regarding how banks could better use the internet to better serve their customers.<p>we were both really pleased with the level of response and steve was well armed when going to his meeting. they agreed that almost everything that was said would be hugely beneficial to customers and our bank. excitingly they are now looking into seeing what could be rolled out and are putting a plan together. thanks for all your feedback - it was massively appreciated.<p>steve and i have now been tasked to try and improve the customers experience when they actually go the branch (the physical bank). so i am hoping we may get the same level of response from the hn community again. is there anything you would like to see in a branch that is currently not there, or does your branch do something particularly useful that others could copy?<p>an example would be rather than give a customer a printed receipt of the transaction that they did in the branch they could instead get an email or a text message.	2010-12-02 13:58:45 UTC		15	0

i am a complete amateur that has been heads down writing a webapp for the last 9 months or so. i probably only have a month&#x27;s equivalent of a real developers output (but i&#x27;ve learned a ton). the app may be nothing to write home about (it&#x27;s basically just a note taking application) but i have implemented a couple uncommon features for that domain that i am hoping will be well-received.<p>having said that, i am gearing up to do a show hn in the next month or two. i read hackernews and the comments pretty regularly (i especially pay attention to the comments for the ask hns and show hns).<p>one thing that i have noticed is that there are a number of sins you do not want to make with your app when doing a show hn or you will likely have the discussion&#x2f;comments centered on those things alone.<p>so i ask of you, what are your biggest pet peeves or cardinal sins of apps posted to show hn?<p>sins i&#x27;ve seen or mentioned in the comments below:<p>* no demo and&#x2f;or no screenshots<p>* forcing people to sign-up for a trial or login for a trial<p>* unclear message about what the app actually is<p>* unclear message about why i would use said app<p>* untested across the latest browsers (e.g. works on newest chrome but not on firefox)<p>* bad typography choices and&#x2f;or hard to read text<p>* over-reliance on boostrap for style (i am currently guilty of this one)<p>* the web app breaks on mobile device<p>* spelling&#x2f;grammar mistakes<p>* site goes down from number of hits<p>* no link to the actual website<p>yours?<p>edit: adding some of the good sins from the comments	2013-09-18 18:10:40 UTC		16	3

36276	just sent my resignation letter and this is my plan.	hi folks. i've just sent in my resignation letter from my job. damn you all. ;)<p>my immediate plan is to plug the most obvious holes in my cs and math education.  being an art school dropout, i have plenty of those, but there are a few that i really want to address now, because otherwise i know they will be nagging me at inopportune times.<p>i'll also be catching up on the reading recommendations in the library section of this site.  i've read most of them already, but i'm sure many of them will make more sense now.<p>in parallel to such reading, i'll finish a pet project with no business aspirations, which i want for personal use: a subset/bastardization of the editor part of jef raskin's humane environment (aka archy).  i plan to use that as my programming editor from then on.  i did a couple prototypes in the past and i know i like it.  i don't like archy itself because of its compromise of using alt keys for leaping; i got myself a thinkpad-like keyboard with buttons under the space bar for this purpose.  again, this is something i had put on hold for too long, and i want to give it a chance before i commit full force to a startup.  <p>i'll timebox 4 months for this although, in good programmer optimism tradition, i hope i'll be done earlier. after that, done or not, i plan to put out a few cheap startup failures fast.  this is much in the spirit of the common advice to novice go players: "lose your first fifty games fast".  i'll just brainstorm for projects that i can execute by myself in, say, one month.  at the end of the timeboxed period, if the project is not anywhere near shippable state, i shelve it and move to something else.  otherwise, i throw it at people and see what happens.  then follow up on the ones that get a better reaction.<p>from this i expect to get some basic competence in business (esp. marketing and dealing with users), system administration, and fluency in web programming (my background is in user interface design and programming for a mmog).  i also expect to get something i can show to potential cofounders so they can evaluate my taste and my ability to execute.  and who knows, maybe something more ambitious grows out of one of these ideas.<p>my goal is to be able to apply to yc with a straight face in winter 2008 or summer 2009.<p>please let me know what do you think about this.  don't pull any punches; i'm interested in criticism, objections, and alternatives, rather than moral support.<p>thanks for reading this far!	2007-07-24 04:40:54 UTC		23	2

265117	ask yc: how do you enable users to use their own domains with your application?	for example, wordpress.com, blogger.com allow you to use your own domains with their application. this proceed as,<p>1. you create a blog at whatever.blogspot.com<p>2. you point a cname from your domain  say mycname.mysite.com to ghs.google.com<p>3. the dns changes propgate and you can access your blog at mycname.mysite.com<p>so what can i do to enable users to use their own domains, with my application, which will be on a subdomain on mysite?<p>[edit: layout]	2008-08-02 18:25:29 UTC		28	4
1869018	ask hn: friends and family offering large amounts of money, what do i do?	ok so i know to some this will probably seem like a dumb question at first, but let me give you a little background:<p>first off, i just applied to yc w2011 and was rejected. during that waiting process i had told only a few close friends and family of my idea.<p>after being rejected on tuesday night and filling in my dad he made an offer to give me $100k for 10% of the company. this morning another close friend of mine made an identical offer (i did not tell my friend about my fathers offer, it was just a complete coincidence).<p>i have no prior experience in this particular field (online commerce) though i do have one relatively small software exit ($1m) in database technology.<p>so i am asking, what should i do in a situation like this one?<p>i guess it is always easier to take someone's money who you do not know. if it was my money i would gladly spend it in pursuit of this idea, however when it comes to close friends and family i just do not want to disappoint anyone or lose their money.<p>it is a tough position for me and i would really appreciate any helpful advice of those who have been in similar situations.<p>thanks in advance for your help!<p>edit: i should probably also point out that i do not come from a wealthy family, however my dad owns a company which is doing very well now and he certainly has the money for this particular offer, losing it would not hurt him in any significant way.<p>my friend who is offering is basically a trust fund baby who simply wants a way to become insanely rich. we do not share that sentiment, i do what i do because i love it and cannot imagine doing anything else, however when i was in college he used to give me money to go play poker with and i won him thousands of dollars over the course of about 6 months or so and he seems to enjoy that rush he gets from taking the risk? weird i know	2010-11-04 14:35:03 UTC		28	2

618906	ask hn: how to make smalltalk?	hey,<p>i realize this appears ot, but i don't think i'm the only one on hn with this problem, and we can just think of it as 'hacking social interactions' instead.<p>here's the problem -- i've broken through the fear (of rejection) of talking to random, attractive girls. however, i have problem maintaining the smalltalk (i.e. conversation generally dies after 2-3 minutes).<p>here's a typical scenario:	4
(<i>) i find some reason to talk about them -- if waiting @ bus stop (do you know when the next bus comes along?); if waiting in life for smoothie (those are nice ear rings ...); etc ...	1
(</i>) then, conversation starts dying; [btw, i'm on a college campus]; i.e. we can chat a bit a bout their major / field of study, etc ... but that's about it<p>the goal here isn't the pickup society's goal of: hey, go into a random bar, get laid; it's just figuring out how to meet new people + have interesting conversations without those .. ehh .. awkward 10 second silences that kill everything.<p>suggestions? (help me debug my life, lol)<p>cheers!	2009-05-20 17:25:31 UTC		47	4

1865350	ask hn: what are you reading right now?	at the end of my first (freshmen) year of engineering i realized i had totally trashed my reading habit (maybe i because i had to study 8 subjects which were mostly irrelevant to my major i.e. ece ). i used to read about 50-60 pages per day in my commute to high school (about half hour each way). even though i commute more now (1&#38;half hour each way) and that too in a much more comfortable bus, i had started reading less. so at the start of this semester(its mostly ended now) i (re)started reading.<p>i completed the foundation series and the last two novels of paulo coelho. other than that i completed makers and ftw. both were fun. right now i am reading two books simultaneously (they both require different kind of attention so its no biggie), they are godel escher bach (funny story how i got it, but that would be a big tangent here) and the elements of computing systems.<p>what are you reading right now?	2010-11-03 16:32:58 UTC		79	0

4728408	ask hn: looking for an ios-cofounder and your feedback	hello everyone!<p>today i was sitting and thinking about place where you can meet some nice co-founder. and i've realized, that hackernews is on of the best places, to tell a startup idea. also i'd like to say sorry for my bad english, hope you will understand my idea. so let's start.<p>the project name is dressable or http://en.dressable.me/. the main idea is to simplify shopping process and try to solve some problems, that appear when	3
you are at a shop and would like to buy something. two main causes are: you see something and you are sure, that you want to buy exactly this product,	4
and exactly today. meanwhile, it's very rare situation when people are so sure about something. usually, they are looking for some ideas how to make a choice.	2
to solve this problem you can do shopping with your close friend, or with a boyfriend/girlfriend, or try to ask people in shop, or try to bring some fashion expert with you, even ask your parent for some certain age time frames. some people can try to send mms, or to call to someone and try to describe, what they are interested to buy.<p>so the main idea, from a customer's point of view, is to provide fast and reliable connections with people who influence you on fashion field. from technology point, it will be a client application, where you will be able to take a picture and discuss with people who influence you, in real-time. and solid back-end part with lots of data mining and information retrieval.<p>if you are interested, i can describe additional points of making money and some implementation points, or my background and experience in related fields	2
and other questions, that you will ask.<p>i got good feedback from consumers, who is interested in our project and people with solid entrepreneurial background. also i know some people from the fashion area.<p>and now i'm looking for some strong ui/ux ios guys, who can help me to build this.<p>best regards,	2

8516709	ask hn: the future of mobile payments processing	hi hn, i&#x27;m working on a project and i just wanted to get a general feel from peers with a pulse on public perception.<p>i&#x27;m caught between working on hardware to read banking cards via the audio jack and via optics (i.e. card io). also as a heads up, i&#x27;m keenly aware of apple phasing out the audio jack in favor of their lightning interface and the pros and cons of both implementations.<p>the problem is while this optic based data extraction is low-cost and democratizes card data gathering amongst other things, i don&#x27;t believe it will grow in popularity because people generally don&#x27;t trust the technology with private data. the concept of you putting your banking card up in a specific frame and a snapshot taken (even though it&#x27;s not saved) will not resonate with a society already plagued with various privacy concerns. it will also be hard to process the numbers on older, heavily use cards with recessed numbers etc.<p>i&#x27;m curious to know what you all think about this growing movement of data extraction at the cross section of mobile payment processing.<p>thank you.	2014-10-27 17:07:53 UTC		1	0

3446558	ask hn: what is best way to send bulk emails to marketing lists?	hello hn!<p>we're developing lead management software and from feedback of early customers, sending emails to marketing lists is considered as critical requirement. they gather email database at different sources like tradeshow, conferences or advertising campaigns to create marketing lists.<p>now there are lot of options available to send transactional emails to subscription lists -- mailchimp, constantcontact, icontact etc. but in this case it won't be possible to verify email address by customer himself hence these marketing lists won't be allowed by these services. what would be best approach to integrate such service in lead management software? we've considered installing postfix but it has its limitations of sending certain number of emails from same ip until its blocked, and as this is going to be used by multiple clients, its more likely that large number of emails will be sent out in short time span.<p>thanks!	2012-01-10 11:25:43 UTC		1	4

1449257	ask hn: learning the math behind cryptography	i've taken an interest in cryptography and have been reading quite a lot on the subject lately. however, my understanding of the mathematics involved needs a little bit of work. i've always excelled in the required math for school up through advanced calculus, but a lot of this is completely foreign to me. can anyone suggest a good source for teaching one's self the math behind cryptography theory? i've looked up unfamiliar terms and made sense of everything i've read, but i still don't feel comfortable with the field in general. specifically, galois fields, relative primality, discrete logarithms, quadratic residues, generators, etc...<p>if anyone knows of good places to learn about these kinds of topics, they'll be greatly appreciated. i generally find purely academic math theory hard to read as it is, even when i understand all the underlying principles.	2010-06-21 16:26:43 UTC		1	0

269507	alternate reality game: the hunted	this just kind of popped into my head - after discussing with a friend he doesn't think people would register for it. i am curious as to what you guys think.<p>the game would have to start on a small regional scale, at least, possibly offering national and global levels of play.<p>a person registers with the site, uploads a photo of themself, and they are now "the hunted." anyone else who comes across the site can register, upload a photo of themselves, and join the hunt.<p>when a hunter believes they have spotted the hunted they ask that person one question, "are you the hunted?" in which, the hunted must answer truthfully. if so, the hunter passes on a unique id (number, email address, username, etc) which the hunted enters into the website.<p>the hunter, now becomes the hunted, and gameplay resumes.<p>some incentives might need to be in order (cash/prize rewards for finding the hunted) but how do you monetize the gameplay to support those prizes? sponsorship opportunities on the website, sponsored clues/events?<p>of course, there is the possibility of ending up in an infinite loop in which a group of friends maintain control of the hunted position. some safeguards would have to be put into place to guard against that.<p>thoughts?	2008-08-07 10:34:37 UTC		1	1

1. use the tool to easily create a simple landing page for your product launch with an email signup field.	2
2. add rewards to the campaign. users whose friends sign up using their referral link can get free products, with increasingly valuable products for increasing shares. e.g. 10 friends, a free basic model of your product; 20 friends, a free premium model of your product.	2
3. share your landing page with your seed list (friends and family, for instance) and ask them to share with others.	0
4. track how many people have signed up for your launch and then export their emails when you&#x27;re ready to contact them.<p>the questions i would like to ask are:	2
- is the value proposition clear?	4
- are there any areas that you think need improvement&#x2f;clarifying?	3
- if you find the idea compelling, but wouldn&#x27;t use the service, why not?<p>thanks,	3

432789	ask hn: can you help me not confuse the googlebot?	i have implemented the rsh library for my website www.trailbehind.com.<p>this lets me change the hash of the url and store data when someone surfs around on my maps, so that i can provide links within the map and back button functionality.<p>however, i'm worried that google and the other search engines aren't going to take kindly to these links.<p>i realized that google wouldn't do things like index my page titles and other content, because they are generated when the dom is ready via javascript.<p>so, for now what i've done is maintain the hard links. for example, these two urls generate the same content:<p>1. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/#get_map_from_name/yosemite_national_park<p>2. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/park_map/yosemite_national_park/<p>i think the problem with this though is that if people link my site, they will end up linking the hash urls, while google will only check out the hard links. and thus, people blogging about me won't help my pagerank.<p>has anyone ever dealt with anything similar or have thoughts on this issue? google rankings are very important to trailbehind, and part of our strategy (which is already working) is getting listed for the long-tail of parks and forests.	2009-01-13 22:03:45 UTC		1	4

704605	do sites using tables for layouts, have an advantage over w3c compliant sites?	following standards is generally a good thing.	4
the web today is a mishmash of technologies and clearly, following web standards has a lot of benefits.&#60;p&#62;however i'm beginning to think that using html tables for layout is a grey area. certainly search engines don't seem to care too much about it (with respect to page ranking).  they have been having to deal with tables for layout since they many of them started.  i therefore don't think there is any evidence that you will be ranked badly from using them. am i wrong?&#60;p&#62;also there are many high ranking sites which use tables such as jakob nielsen's useit.com (http://www.useit.com/). admittedly this site is old, but it has a google page rank of 8/10?&#60;p&#62;also many pay-per-click search engine marketing (sem) sites use tables for layout.	0
such as the ones created by chance barnett. (i'll mention the sites but i am in no way affiliated with them, i heard about them through mixergy.com, anyway: doubleyourdating, catchhimandkeephim, havetherelationshipyouwant, loveisinthestars).&#60;p&#62;so my question is what sort of advantage do these sites have over pure standards driven sites?  especially as many of them still have external css files.&#60;p&#62;i saw this article a while back on hacker news and it did have some good points:  http://www.flownet.com/ron/css-rant.html&#60;p&#62;i don't want to use tables, but if the advantage is speed maybe we should consider it?&#60;p&#62;anyway i would be interested in your thoughts from a technical perspective.&#60;p&#62;many thanks.	1

1949529	why the wikileak is useless.	the recent leaks are opinions and views of individuals who happen to work for the american govt. that does  not make their opinion the official opinion of america. america is still the peoples country, and will show that. i highly doubt any war will break out and if it does it will be from poorly educated nations who view the truthful facts about their leaders as slander (one cable talks about how a leader in africa has "16 doctorates", this might offend him that an american doesn't take him seriously, but in all honestly neither does any other educated human. all in all many personal feelings will be hurt, but the world goes on. we called each other names on the playground, now we've found a bigger playground and wikileaks is the playground snitch.	2010-11-29 05:54:55 UTC		1	2

5179441	boeing engineers begin vote on strike this week	23,000 boeing engineers, members of speea, have until february 19th to decide if they want to go on strike.<p>the strike would slow down fixing the 787, but it has wider implications: white collar, professional workers are not known for striking or belonging to unions - this strike can challenge that. also, in an unusual move for any union, the speea engineers are rejecting a new contract that splits the workforce into two tiers - boeing is offering guaranteed pension benefits for current employees at the expense of new hires (who would receive a 401k instead of a pension). grounding of 787 has given boeing engineers additional leverage to demand boeing to extend their original contract.<p>the union believes a strike would shut down boeing production lines in everett, wash., where its big planes are made, as well as renton, wash., where it cranks out more than one of its widely-used 737s every day. a strike would also shut down boeing's new, non-union plant in north charleston, s.c., which makes 787s in addition to those assembled in everett.<p>more info: http://www.manufacturing.net/news/2013/02/boeing-engineers-begin-vote-on-strike-this-week	2

3134206	skycaddie christmas offer 	skycaddie target christmas market	4
10 / 10 / 2011 by j nusrat	2
tags:	2
skycaddie have launched a special christmas offer which will help to ensure they stay number one in the rangefinder market through the gift buying season. the offer applies to their flagship model the skycaddie sgx which is already the best selling golf gps rangefinder on the market.	4
the offer gives the user a free 12 month birdie membership worth £29.95. this gives unlimited downloads of all uk courses, european and worldwide membership can be added by simply paying the difference of £5 and £10 respectively.	4
skycaddie have remained the best selling rangefinder brand in golf for some years, customers only bone of contention has been that payment of a £29.95 annual is the only way to access the skycaddie sgx full features.	3
whilst many of skycaddie's competitors do not charge any fees to download courses skycaddie have always stayed in front based on the fact that the mapping of the courses and the accuracy of the unit are second to none.	2
skycaddie remain the only brand to walk every course to offer the most accurate data for the gps units to work from.  whilst this is only a short term offer any units purchased before christmas simply need to be activated before the end of january to ensure that any christmas presents can take full advantage of this offer.	4
this offer is also a welcome boost to all the authorised online retailers such as www.completegolfer.co.uk because there are many unauthorised retailers and parallel importers of the skycaddie sgx that will not be able to offer this deal.	2011-10-20 10:15:07 UTC	http://www.completegolfer.co.uk/brand/skycaddie	1	1

3647358	exclamation mark	exclamation mark	3
an exclamation mark usually shows strong feeling, such as surprise, anger or joy. using an exclamation mark when writing is rather like shouting or raising your voice when speaking. exclamation marks are most commonly used in writing quoted speech. you should avoid using exclamation marks in formal writing, unless absolutely necessary.<p>1. use an exclamation mark to indicate strong feelings or a raised voice in speech:<p>she shouted at him, “go away! i hate you!”<p>he exclaimed: “what a fantastic house you have!”<p>“good heavens!” he said, “is that true?”<p>“help!”<p>“shut up!”<p>“stop!”<p>2. many interjections need an exclamation mark:<p>“hi! what’s new?”<p>“oh! when are you going?”<p>“ouch! that hurt.”<p>3. a non-question sentence beginning with “what” or “how” is often an exclamation and requires an exclamation mark:<p>what idiots we are! (we are such idiots.)<p>how pretty she looked in that dress! (she looked very pretty in that dress.)<p>4. in very informal writing (personal letter or email), people sometimes use two or more exclamation marks together:<p>i met john yesterday. he is so handsome!!!<p>remember, don’t be late!!<p>i’ll never understand this language!!!!<p>remember, try to avoid exclamation marks in formal writing such as an essay or business letter.	2012-02-29 11:06:34 UTC	http://blog.manuscriptedit.com/2012/02/exclamation-mark/	1	0

3866729	signs of best fertility centers	infertility is a medical problem that results in the inability to conceive a child or carry a pregnancy to full term. a couple is usually diagnosed as infertile after one year of frequent, unprotected, sexual intercourse.<p>when you decide to seek treatment to improve fertility or to overcome infertility, making sure that you choose a good fertility clinic is very important. one of the most common procedures performed at these clinics is in vitro fertilization, also called ivf for short.<p>this is a procedure that combines sperm and eggs in a dish in a laboratory to form embryos. a select number of the embryos are then transferred to the uterus where they may implant and develop into a fetus. if successful, the woman will become pregnant and will go through her pregnancy just as any other woman who conceived naturally.<p>today ivf or invitro fertilization is slowly emerging as one of the preferred answers to issues like infertility and cases of miscarriage and failure in conceiving. ivf clinics are mushrooming in most cities of the world claiming to provide top class treatment and sure shot result. however, it is absolutely imperative to understand the various features that are integral to good ivf clinics.<p>choosing a fertility clinic is an important decision, and there are many factors that come into play. after researching fertility clinics’ success rates and treatment offerings, you may want to supplement your knowledge by asking the fertility clinic some questions.<p>ivf clinics must have the following facilities.the clinic should also be able to contact special labs which have testing capabilities of such immunological obstruction. the clinic should enjoy the services of an embryologist who should at least have a doctorate in chemical, biological or physical science. the person should have earlier performed at least 100 ivf procedures in a year. at least one person in the department must have expertise in fields like andrology, pre-implantation, pre and post fertilization and embryology.<p>so, ivf clinics must be the ones, which, not only assures you of efficiency but it does gets shown in the action as well.	3
most common facilities offered by ivf clinics worldwide include:<p>art	1
ivf	4
iui	3
icsi	0
sperm retrieval	3
laser assisted hatching	1
sperm bank	0
freezing of embryo/oocyte/sperm	3
donation of sperm/egg/embryo	1
surrogacy and surrogates<p>other services of ivf clinics include psychological counseling and also a rigorous process of screening when donors are involved.<p>other factors that determine the choice a particular ivf clinic include factors like distance from home, the cost, the kind of counseling that is offered, the recommendations made by a certified doctor, the presence of a patient support group, the areas of specialization of the clinic, the rate of success achieved by the clinic, the kind of advertising that the clinic indulges in and reports and reviews by earlier patients or of friends and relatives who might know of the clinic.<p>usually, doctors and specialists related to in vitro fertilization, iui, or icsi plan out the treatment in accordance with the medical reports of the tests conducted of an individual. every individual has different sets of situation and disorders so is the treatment devised for them.<p>keep in mind that clinic which has higher ivf cost is the only one catering quality treatment; instead clinic which is well organized and has expert doctors and medical facilities is the better one.<p>the key to ensuring that the ivf treatment process is relatively hassle-free is to choose the right clinic, one that lays down protocols and guidelines, advises dr.gautam allahbadia,is ivf ,surrogacy specialist and the director of rotunda -the center for human reproduction, the world-renowned infertility clinic at mumbai, india.<p>parenthood is a life changing and eternally rewarding experience and many have chosen ivf as a successful way to bring a child into their lives.<p>we will be happy to provide a second opinion on your conceiving a fertility problem. this is a free service.please fill in your details on website at http://www. rotundaivf.com or http://www.wewantababy.com or http://www.iwannagetpregnant.com simply a phone call at +91 22 2655 2000 or +91 22 26405000 or an email: rotunda.tchr@gmail.com<p>rotunda- centre for human reproduction	0

2936692	facts about surrogacy in india	every couple wants to a child who can take forward their genes and legacy after they leave this world. ability to bear child is the biggest boon for a female that nature has blessed her with. unfortunately some couples are denied this happiness because of reasons associated with husband, wife or both. the inability to bear child has increased in the past years because of late marriages, hectic lifestyles, changes in diet, increased use of alcohol &#38; smoking and pollution.<p>couples  and singles,who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity. raising a child is one of the special joys of life.unfortunately,nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.<p>"pregnancy is very easy for most of the people but can you just imagine not being able to have a child. when we read stories about infertile couples and our heart goes out to them and when you know there is a way out ,know about surrogacy,intended parents are so excited. what's nine months when you can give someone a family," feels and says indian surrogates.<p>"surrogacy is becoming way more common," but still there is much controversy and misinformation about the issue.<p>what is surrogacy?	4
a surrogacy arrangement is one in which one woman (the surrogate mother) agrees to bear a child for the intended parents and surrender it at birth. this provides an opportunity for those who are unable to carry a child themselves to overcome their childlessness.<p>surrogates may carry the pregnancy to delivery after having an embryo, to which she has no genetic relationship, transferred to her uterus (called gestational surrogacy). if the pregnant woman received compensation for carrying and delivering the child (besides medical and other reasonable expenses) the arrangement is called a commercial surrogacy, otherwise the arrangement is sometimes referred to as an altruistic surrogacy.<p>while with surrogacy fast spreading in different parts of the world even those couple who had remote possibilities of enjoying parenting are now finding a ray of hope. what is more interesting is the fact that even single women and men can realize their dream of becoming parents as surrogacy realizes their dream of becoming parents.<p>surrogacy and surrogates are required by infertile couples in usa,canada and around the globe, including france, germany, switzerland, italy ,australia and japan.unlike the u.s. and india , where surrogacy has been commercialized and surrogate moms can charge for their services to infertile couples,intended parents.<p>while the issue of surrogacy often raises the question of whether the surrogate will be able to give up the child after the birth,but the same is not an issue in india at all.birth certificate will be issued in the name of the genetic parents or intended parent.<p>whether you are married, unmarried, in a same sex relationship or single, rotunda-the center for human reproduction can help you secure your family.surrogacy in india online at www.surrogacymumbai.com  that provides information, referral and support to infertile couples,intended parents and singles who are interested in becoming parents.<p>so for number of couples who are not able to enjoy parenting it is needless to say that such countries are becoming an obvious choice for those thousands of childless couples. while it is not only the expenses that really is coming handy when these couples approach these countries besides the availability of egg donors and various treatment options and expertise to promise much expected results is forcing them to look forward towards such countries that give importance to gay surrogacy india.<p>but the situation in developing countries and emerging market like india,is quite different as the conditions in these nations have been quite favorable making surrogacy easy for foreign couples.if interested in surrogacy, india would be an ideal destination for its affordability,its richness of experince and diversity in the field of infertility treatment.not to mention that india, unlike some developing countries, has a fairly advanced medical system and doctors who speak english.<p>the cheaper availability of surrogates in india is attracting a lot of interest.while not just the ease of the rules but also cost that is incurred here is something that is quite tempting not to mention gives the much needed respite for many couples who otherwise cannot afford the costs involved in this process. hence this is one reason apart from many other reasons why many childless couples are now headed towards these nations to realize their dream of experiencing the most privileged feeling of parenthood.<p>low cost of surrogacy in india attracts many international tourists to fly to the country to fulfill their dream of having a child. but low cost does not compromise with the quality of the treatment. therefore, india is the one of the best options if you are looking for high quality surrogacy treatment at affordable cost.<p>having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to create your family. unlike some alternative methods, the surrogacy process allows your child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of in vitro fertilization) both parents. it also gives you the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself. your child is conceived because of your desire, hard work, and dedication to becoming parents : the true genesis of your child is his or her creation in your minds and hearts.<p>one such friendly surrogacy clinic in india is rotunda-the center for human reproduction,they offer gestational surrogacy in india to people of all nationalities. all couples including lesbian and gay couples and even single men and single women can avail this facility to fulfill their dream of enjoying parenthood.<p>they realize the journey to create your family with the help of third party reproduction involves a considerable financial and emotional investment on your part. there goal is to provide you with professional care and guidance to afford you the greatest opportunity to achieve a pregnancy and to ensure that your journey with there surrogacy program is as calm and relaxed as possible.<p>now everyone can have baby...start creating your family today by contacting them and

1578997	question about jumping from nyc to mountain view	just got offered a full time gig in mountain view the mid 90s in terms of yearly salary.  i'm pulling a little over 100 in nyc as a contractor.  the gig in ca, is something i'd like to do on a personal level so it has a bit more weight to it than just money.<p>curious what your guys opinion of that salary is.  the cost of living is vastly different in computation from my own.  so, an assessment of "that could be tough" to "you will be eating caviar from golden slabs while steve wozniak ferries you goblets of faygo from your walk in sub zero mansion" would be really helpful.<p>i was considering staying in san francisco at least in the beginning as i am very much a child of mass transit and getting my road legs up to snuff will take a little time.  as will buying a car.  plus i'd like to live there for a bit.<p>i hear the commute from sf to mountainview is a little above an hour.  depending on the location in sf.  i am allergic to bullets and stabbings, so i would like to avoid any location where these things are considered culturally acceptable forms of communication.  i have put zero effort into finding a location, but will lean on friends for advice.<p>was just curious if i should be asking for more.  is that a competitive rate for a systems engineering role in the area.  i don't care about being lifestyles of the rich and famous, but i don't want to be stranded in a difficult situation.<p>thanks for any advice.	2010-08-05 19:11:21 UTC		2	0

352068	ask hn: i need a linux desktop and programming workstation. any advice?	my budget is $1500,  and i will use this as my main workstation for web development, publishing cross platform software (financial, mathematical, and data analysis), programming with eclipse, netbeans and the occasional glade, experimenting with multicore programming in languages like c++, java, erlang and haskell, experiment with nvidia cuda programming in c, number crunching, database development, data mining and simulation software (both writing and running) and finally, regular office productivity (openoffice, gimp, etc...), including substantial photo editing. well, that's a lot of stuff, but i'll do each of them to a certain extent.&#60;p&#62;i'd like to get a velociraptor (300gb) as my boot disk, and a larger disk for media files. this cuts my budget for a powerful quad core like the q9550 though. i'm trying ecc configurations (i want 8gb of ram) as well, on server boards, but the motherboards are double the price and so is the ram, so i can't get the 10000rpm disk. please help me make a decision of what's really important and what components would you select.	2008-11-03 12:52:48 UTC		2	3

3540554	tips for telling your boss about your side project	a year or two ago i had a good idea for a small startup in the same industry as my day job. i told my boss about the idea but we just haven't had the resources to execute it -- we have a ton of stuff pending on our existing projects. so, i've been working on it at home at night and on the weekends, and it's been pretty exciting so far.<p>i'd like my bosses support (at least some degree of it) and i want to be honest with him about the project. i don't intend to quit. since our company does some investments in other companies, my ideal scenario would be if he gives me company resources to further develop it, in exchange for some equity.<p>has anyone been in this situation before? what would be the best way to tell him about my project? what should i avoid saying?	2012-02-01 23:11:01 UTC		2	3
5165658	should i quit?	here is my awful situation.	1
my grammer isn't that good, keep that in mind while you read.<p>i work in a php (a language i despise) devshop as the lead developer (i only have 1 year experience in programming), we build cms powered websites.	1
i started working in this company a few months ago, before that i worked at 2 other similiar companies.<p>the main thing i hate is the workflow, for example here is how we build a website:<p><pre><code>  * a design is sent to me by mail.	1
* i go to a website we've already built and download it's source	1
* i clean the source folders (images etc..)	0
* i go to a website we've already built and export the database tables	1
* i clean them.	4
* i build it.	0
* i upload it with ftp.	2
* test using the refresh button :o	2
* done.	0
</code></pre>	3
at no point unit testing is used (my boss says it's a waste of time).	4
we don't use revision control tools (my boss says no one uses it).	4
we don't use tools to automate stuff (deployment etc..).<p>when i suggest to my boss to use those stuff, he comes back "i have more than 5 years of experience you have 1".	4
my boss isn't a developer, he thinks firefox was built by google and "ietester is better than ie9 so use it".<p>all of our websites have stuff like this in the code:	3
`mysql_query('select * from foo where id = ' . $_get['id'])`.	0
some of our websites have no password verification on the admin panel.<p>keep in mind that i have seen those stuff in all 3 companies i worked in, this is awful.<p>hn'ers should i quit and start my own company ?	2013-02-04 17:43:15 UTC		2	4

6971391	is google's chrome os / android ever going to get java support? any options?	our team is currently looking for an alternative way to replace the java code dependency into our web-based saas application. our app uses java for detecting scales, printers i.e standard printer for invoice &#x2f; packing slip printing and a thermal printer for ups, fedex and usps label printing. but lately, ever since that massive java security breach and the ongoing updates to java versions has created issues and our app only works with earlier versions of java. it forced us to refactor our code to get it working with latest java version. but, with every new java version update release, we have to be very vigilant and see if it breaks any functionality. majority of our clients are using chrome browser on windows pc but that market is shrinking rapidly. they are now moving onto chrome os and android based devices and mac too. a 32-bit chrome browser do not support java 7 on the mac platform (as per official java page: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;java.com&#x2f;en&#x2f;download&#x2f;faq&#x2f;chrome.xml). so java has issue with mac too.<p>so, here we are, searching for a solid alternative to java language which is based on a newer open source standards that everyone has been pushing for. considering oracle&#x27;s lawsuit against google for its use of patented java (where did the &quot;open source&quot; go?) technology makes google even less likely to use it. ironically, most android applications are written in java but they use &quot;dalvik&quot; instead of java virtual machine.<p>we are debating the way to go is use of html5, javascript, node.js. but again, what to do between now and the time that html5 is adopted? or should we opt for a &quot;gwt web toolkit&quot; (gwt) will let us develop in java and then compile it to optimized javascript to run on the web. but our goal is try to stay away from anything that relates java code.<p>this should really be asked to someone at google, but i would like to get the opinions of hn experts. please share your thoughts. thanks.	2013-12-27 16:55:55 UTC		3	4

1994708	ask hn: what is an unemployed science teacher to do?	until recently i have been a high school science teacher in pakistan.  although i will 'officially' find out on monday i have today been informally told that i have lost my appeal against being fired for refusing to teach creationism as science.<p>i live in a moderate sized but remote town with only one school.  i am looking for other employment and have the support of my teaching association but without a good reference from the current school it is doubtful i will find another teaching job soon.  i am working on relocating to a bigger city but i have a young family and it will take time and money.<p>the reason i have turned to hacker news is that there are many self-employed people here who earn their living on the internet so to speak.  this is something i want to try but i feel overwhelmed by all the myriad information available. there are many ways of earning money on-line and i am not sure which to pursue.  i have lots of time and am willing to put in a lot of effort but i need some guidance and mentoring.<p>i am proficient in java programming and have basic skills in php/html/css and javascript. i am also learning rubyonrails.  i have tried to find programming and writing work on freelance websites without success.  i also registered with some remote tutoring companies but have yet to be accepted.  i have been reading about affiliate marketing on places like digitalpoint and warriorforums but the whole enterprise seems to me very spammy and i would like to avoid such things if possible.<p>in a similar position, what would you do hn?	2010-12-11 12:36:41 UTC		3	4

8504654	alternative to google adsense?	i was banned from google adsense for auto generated content. (no big deal) however, since then i have used conjunction junction, linkshare, amazon, yes advertising, (in text ads) and nothing seems to work that well like google adsense. my site gets about 200 a day and continues to grow slowly. (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.bestoftheinternets.com) i would grow &#x2f; develop more if it made more money... but with out good adsense the ctr rates aren&#x27;t that great, so focus on other stuff.<p>yahoo&#x2f;bing and some of the other advertising companies won&#x27;t deal with you unless you have 10,000 hits a day.<p>any alternatives, thanks in advance.	2014-10-24 17:04:16 UTC		5	3

899745	ask hn: good open-source examples of properly tiered asp.net architectures.	after working with asp.net (c#) for around 3 years, 2 of which was with a company that had no real solid architecture, i've realized that i have a lot to learn when it comes to creating properly designed web applications.<p>i'm wondering if anyone has examples of open-source software that i could study, tutorials to walk-through or even a good book to pick up so that i can better understand this process.<p>a lot of the work i did at the aforementioned job was a (small) step in the right direction with trying to separate presentation from logic, but in most cases the code behind files for our pages were tightly coupled with the database structure. they did use a database management object to handle the actual database call, connections, command, data adapters, etc, but the page itself was still constructing the query and sending it off to the database object to fetch.<p>towards the end of my tenure there, we outsource a new product to a very capable team based out of boston and i had the pleasure of working with their code for integration purposes. this is what "woke me up" to how we were going about things all wrong. their designs had calls out to a business logic layer, which then called a data access layer, which returned objects, collections or just straight datatable/sets depending on the need.<p>what i still struggled with, in my own designs, is what goes in the business logic layer and what goes in the data access layer. when to use objects and when to not, etc. i know those questions are somewhat subjective and based on the project at hand, but i'd love a really good example or book that covers these exact techniques so that i can be a better programmer.<p>obviously, pseudo code examples and open discussion on the topic is also very much welcomed.	2009-10-23 22:24:23 UTC		5	2

2997524	request for web design help	the mathsjam landing page makes you want to tear your eyes out, i know.  for the intended audience it's not actually that bad, but i'd be interested in having a better one.  problem is, we have no money to throw at something like this<p>but people who do work deserve suitable and appropriate compensation.  so here's the thing.  if you're interested in coming to the mathsjam weekend, i'll give you a free place if you redesign the landing page and a couple of associated pages.  i know that this will be a non-trivial amount of work, but i really, <i>really</i> don't want anything fancy.  i'm not going to say "hard hard can it be?" because i know i can't do it, but i'm pretty sure that someone with interest, experience or inclination will be able to do something significantly better in not a lot of time.<p>so if you're interested, either comment below, or email me at mathsjam (at) solipsys spot co spot uk and we can talk about scope of work, independence, criteria for acceptance, and compensation.  since compensation is likely to be a free spot at the mathsjam, probably this will only be of interest to uk people, but it may be possible to set up a three way deal.  i do, for example, have someone coming to the mathsjam from the us, and maybe they can pay you instead of paying me.<p>there are options and possibilities.<p>work done "on spec" is entirely at your own risk.  in return, i promise i won't use anything you show me without agreeing compensation.<p>i hope this is of interest.  if i get no responses by the weekend i'll be looking elsewhere.	2011-09-14 19:28:28 UTC		6	2

4273012	ask hn: books for parents of mathematics-loving children?	i am wondering what books would be good to recommend to parents whose children are deeply in love with mathematics, especially if the parents themselves have only an average background in mathematics. that was my situation a decade ago, and i found some helpful books i'll mention here, but i think a lot of hacker news participants can suggest some books that are even better. i'll be speaking to a group of parents whose children are primary-school age but already well familiar with secondary school algebra and geometry, taking an advanced mathematics summer course.<p>books that i found helpful for understanding mathematics when my oldest son, a mathematics-lover, was growing up include<p>concepts of modern mathematics by ian stewart (dover reprint)<p>numbers and geometry by john stillwell (springer)<p>vision in elementary mathematics by w. w. sawyer (dover reprint)<p>the art of problem solving by sandor lehoczky and richard rusczyk (art of problem solving)<p>a frequently recommended book for this need is developing math talent by susan assouline and ann lupkowski-shoplik, but i haven't made much use of that book.<p>what am i missing? what do you recommend?	2012-07-20 21:38:53 UTC		7	0

116973	just how important is a good domain?	i am somewhat of a domain addict. i am always buying up domains "i" think are cool and have no idea what to do with them afterwards. eventually, they just expire off into dead domain land or some squatter picks them up and tries to sell it back to me.<p>sometimes, i have a really great idea for a domain of course someone has been squatting on it since '96 and want 2.5 million for it or some craziness.<p>my question is this... if / when i am lucky enough to get some funding for one of my projects, just how important is the domain? i mean is it worth dropping a large chunk of your capitol on a domain? if you get 5 million ( oh ya baby! ) is it worth it to drop a mil on a tld like "blue.com" for example or if you get 10k is it worth is to drop 2k on a domain or better to just go for a webby 2.0; ziggle-zwaggle-mangozr-twotozr-megoezr...<p>brandable kinda thing? ( don't feel bad btw if one of those are your actual domain. i actually own quite a few wiggle-waggle-ziggle-zaggle webby2.0 domains :p )<p>obviously, i know domains are important, your gonna get more traffic and better recognition with blue.com as opposed to blueeeeeeee.mobi but, is it worth it?  i stress a lot over the perfect domain, and i know it's fruitless ( especially since i don't have any money )but i do.<p>the price of a decent domains being as high as they are? is it worth it to stress over a domain? i mean if you have a real decent idea then theoretically the domain shouldn't matter...	2

7547914	draftin' mtg draft simulator beta 3	draftin&#x27; has entered its third beta release! i would like to take a moment to thank all of the beta users who participated in beta 2, you all have been a huge help in finding issues with draftin&#x27; that i did not find myself. in beta 2, you guys&#x2f;gals uncovered an array of bugs which have been patched, along with usability issues around user interaction and menu&#x2f;gui simplicity which have been fixed&#x2f;updated.<p>anyway, i have been taking a more <i></i>community oriented<i></i> approach to draftin&#x27;s continued development. basically, i am letting the users give large input as to what they would like to see in draftin&#x27;, and i have been prioritizing development based on that input. beta 3 is entirely community driven, consisting of all the most reported issues&#x2f;bugs. hopefully beta 3 brings a much more well rounded and bug free drafting experience!<p>#### beta 3 contains the following updates<p>- add flashing tab on various events throughout draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page&#x2f;tab.	1
- play audible sound on various events throughout draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page&#x2f;tab.	4
- fix ui issues in <i></i>my cards<i></i> section where card rows are out of sync.	4
- make user profile display users cards. if you ever leave a draft&#x2f;the coordinator deleted the draft, you can now retrieve your last drafts cards from your profile.	2
- greatly improved set selection ui.	2
- fix server error when users try to join the same draft twice.	0
- fixed issues with kicking users from a draft.<p>anyway, that&#x27;s all for beta 3. i am calling this update a usability update as it touches on the main issues you all found in draftin&#x27;. i hope everybody enjoys the updates and continues to help push this little mtg draft simulator towards dev complete!<p>if you like this tool or have suggestions then feel free to leave them here. :)	2014-04-07 17:28:23 UTC	http://www.draftin.co/articles/14	11	3

3970411	ask hn: have i burnt out and what should i do?	hello hn, i'm a fairly active member of the hn community but, as usual with this kind of post, i'm posting with a throwaway to avoid being labelled "damaged goods".<p>for the past few months, i've found it harder and harder to be motivated at work. i've known that i have had things to do, yet instead of doing them i will browse the internet, do other projects or even just sit there doing nothing. i open terminals, long files or emails - just so i can seem busy.<p>in my spare time, i contribute a lot to open-source and i work on a lot of projects in my spare time - i don't think i'm just being lazy as i will work hard in my spare time. i just can't bring myself to work hard at my job.<p>it's becoming more and more stressful as i am unable to complete projects that need to be done. i have a few that are urgent now but i keep putting them off, making up excuses, etc. i've just had yet another given to me. this time with a 3 week deadline. it's stuff i know that i can do and there's more than enough time, but i just can't bring myself to do it.<p>most days i go home thinking to myself "i literally did nothing today". it's depressing and i'm really starting to hate work.<p>is this burnout or just laziness and how can i tell? what should i do? should i try and get better or just quit and hope for success at a new position? what if it happens again (i've been fine for the past year or so since i joined my present company, it has just been these past months)? finally, does anyone else have any experience with burn-out and how did you get over it?	2012-05-14 10:57:38 UTC		14	4

1254135	ask hn: what happened to rational discourse?	i'm curious why the reaction to the apple developer tos change is making this community react so strongly.  one of the main reasons i left reddit for hacker news was the level of discourse was elevated and the polemics and hysterics in the stories were almost non-existent.  i don't disagree that the apple dispute with adobe is big news and calls for discussion.  what concerns me is the freewheeling hysteria that seems to be driving the topic.  as is almost always the case, i suspect this tos change will either be modified, re-interpreted, or apple will suffer community backlash.  as for my personal opinion, i would feel a far keener loss by losing the valuable insight and discussion that has so far been present in this community than i would feel over a change in the apple developer tos.	2010-04-09 23:06:01 UTC		20	3

1886617	announcing startupmonth.org (our november "startup sprint" project)	site: http://startupmonth.org<p>when i asked people "who's with me?" on getting a startup out the door in the month of november (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1773398), i was blown away by the response.  it seems i hit a common nerve.  amongst the many comments on that post, people suggested various ways of tracking the progress of their projects and keeping in touch with each another (spreadsheets, google docs, facebook groups, etc).  i was personally not planning on anything other than an announcement on hn when i had completed my project, but by the end of that day it was clear there was something bigger going on, and that more would be needed to help track it.<p>so i started to think about what was /really/ going on.  it seems that we all feel drawn to be our better selves when we have a common goal, even though we may be achieving it in different ways.  what was needed was a site that could help people be accountable for their goal, and draw them together to finish them.<p>thus, startupmonth.org.<p>at this point though, it was still a pipe dream.  i have my own full-time consulting gig, a new full-time job to transition into, a part-time startup, and side projects that need to be completed (the entire goal for november for me is to finally finish as many of the side projects as possible).   i had vague intentions of building a site for this, and even bought the domain startupmonth.org, but was not sure when i would be able to fit it in.<p>thankfully, jon gilbraith (hn: inm) stepped up and volunteered to help develop the site, and jake stutzman of http://www.elevatevc.com volunteered to do the design.  so, for the last 30 days, we've been building and designing the site in the very little bits of spare time we had, and today we'd like to show it to you. we were hoping to get this out before november 1st, but had too many things on our collective plates to be able to get it done.<p>now that 30 days has passed, there is still plenty of work to do to the site, but in the spirit of startupmonth we are launching anyways, and will tweak and fix the site as it is used.  shipping is a feature!  so, <i></i>please<i></i> let us know your thoughts on the site,  either here or as comments on http://startupmonth.org/apps/startupmonthorg.  we're aware that there are some missing features but everything we need to showcase, post news on and discuss our apps is there.<p>also, need to mention the awesome site that the 21times guys have done that can also help with getting your startups off the ground:  http://hn.21times.org   ryan reached out to me via email when they were finishing it up - my apologies ryan for not getting back to you.   would love to chat on how we could integrate and make these complimentary sites.<p>cheers!	2010-11-09 15:04:20 UTC		55	1

i wanted to get your feedback on a feature i was thinking of adding to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2f;&#x2f;sharecred.com&quot;&gt;sharecred&lt;&#x2f;a&gt;. before i proceed, my sincere thanks for taking your time and providing your valuable feedback! thanks!<p>as you may know, &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2f;&#x2f;sharecred.com&quot;&gt;sharecred&lt;&#x2f;a&gt; is based on the  philosophy that we need to reach out to people outside of our immediate circle. (yes, hn allows that, agreed, but hn is very limited in expression, and not really interested in exploring the possibilities. you can think of sharecred as similar to hn, but based on a blogging model, and bringing in controls based on one&#x27;s relationship and expertise.)<p>assuming that you are with me so far (with regards to what sharecred is), i would like to ask if the following feature is of any interest to anyone.<p>&lt;b&gt;feature:&lt;&#x2f;b&gt; ask questions to our 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree of relations (or to people with certain recognition), and getting feedback anonymously or not.<p>you can think of quora being brought down to your 1st&#x2f;2nd&#x2f;3rd degree relations or people of certain recognition.<p>what i am seeing in this idea is couple of things. 1. asking questions to people outside of your circle, but still controlled. 2. getting answers anonymously from people in your circle, or not.<p>for example, a question such as &#x27;what wine do you drink?&#x27; is not something we want to put on quora (of course, you can put on facebook, but as i argued sometime back, it has limitations.) such questions are ripe for limiting to your circles, and in some cases, benefit from anonymity.<p>what do you think?<p>thanks again for your time,	2

available: immediate<p>serious inquiries only, please. (i hope it is not inappropriate to post this to forum. if it is, my sincere apologies.)	0

7388518	ask hn: best way to authenticate for restful service?	i&#x27;m building a server that allows users to control and access a web-connected sensor. the server lets the user connect to the device, change settings, and retrieve data that the sensor uploads.&lt;p&gt;all of the requests are stateless, so the the server does not have to maintain a session or any session state. i do however need to make sure that the user only accesses the devices and logs they are authorized to.&lt;p&gt;so my question is this: is it better to have every request be authenticated with the user&#x27;s username and password, or should i still establish a session and use something like hmac? what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?&lt;p&gt;thanks!	2014-03-12 21:27:05 UTC		1	0
3009655	music and programming, am i right?	i know that it's better to not listen to anything, but some people like me are addicted to music.<p>i came to the conclusion that if i'm listening to rock where the main singer is a baritone or bass(or the music is , like joy division i don't lose my concentration) but on the other way, if i'm listening to something were the singer is a tenor, then i'm fucked. that's also why probably the popular music generated by males are usually by tenors, it alienates the mind of the listener.<p>so when you are going to do something serious or want to have a better productivity while listening to music, don't listen stuff with high notes, believe me, it works.	2011-09-18 06:43:30 UTC		1	0
9883955	hackable/diy wireless home security sensor solutions	i want to replace my old security system with something more modern, and preferrably something that does not mandate monthly fees and&#x2f;or proprietary hardware&#x2f;communication protocols. my old system has wireless sensors, but it uses traditional fm signaling which most computers&#x2f;phones are unable to intercept (yeah, i dream of a phone with a good programmable software radio). an ideal solution would be bluetooth le sensors (door, motion, sirens etc) which i could monitor from an aged android gsm phone (i can write the software myself if i have to). this &quot;alarm central phone&quot; would then be able to signal alerts to an app and&#x2f;or sms messages to other phones (the ones we carry). any pointers?	2015-07-14 10:59:11 UTC		1	4

5732895	ask hn: how to break a bad habit?	i can't get up in the mornings. it's been like this for probably 10-15 years.<p>at some point along the way, i was definitely burned out and mildly depressed, but that's definitely over now. the impact is manageable, i have a job that honestly doesn't care when i'm working, which is great. but it kills my personal time. when i'm in bed for ~10 hours when i could get by fine on 7.5-8 hours, that's a lot of lost opportunity. i'd love to go for a run in the morning, but i can't justify it when i'm only out of bed at 9:45.<p>it used to be much more severe when i was unwell, but i still snooze for hours, almost no matter what time i set the alarm to. a therapist helped me realise that i was sleeping my problems away (fear of facing reality etc), and addressing those problem (low self esteem). my totally uneducated stab at self-diagnosis now is that after having settled in for a decade, the habit has entrenched itself.<p>i am fairly certain it's not about the amount of sleep i'm getting. i can get up (almost) like clockwork for weeks on end when external factors forces it, and not be tired. it's the same no matter where i sleep: at home, at my parents or in-laws' houses or in luxury hotels. i can get up at 5 to catch an early flight with no problems. i have no reason to believe i don't sleep well.<p>so, for remedies, i've tried a ton of things. mostly they fail because i fail to convince myself at the time of the alarm that i need to get up. applying logic doesn't work, because it feels like the reasoning part of my brain is still shut down. i can "shout" to my self that i should get up, but be unable to control my body from hitting snooze and going back to bed.<p>i've looked into stuff like the artificial sunrise-alarm and wakemate, but those seem to address the issue of making waking up more comfortable, the issue i need to address is waking up, period.<p>what can i do to kick this habit?	2013-05-19 14:17:38 UTC		1	4

3437138	ask nh: would ur startup pay to get relevant content to ur social medias chans?	<i>problem:	4
every b2c startup has a facebook page and twitter account, but they don't have time to manage it effectively, or they're just spamming (just offers/buy/discount/non-relevant). so the fans/followers are just few and none is interacting.	2
this way your social media marketing is meaningless.<p></i>solution:	4
a web service where you add the company's fb page, tw account, g+, etc. and automatically will be published good content, relevant to your startup.<p>you have just to reply to few questions (10 min) a week and your social media channels will be in autopilot.	2
questions will be something like:	2
-what are the features that you're working on this week?	2
-what are the interesting articles, about your market, that you've red this week?	0
-how the team have spent the weekend?<p>this content will be aggregated with other generic content built by our team, like "what's the best feature of the last version?" or "good day! how your day is started? our in a great way!", and automatically scheduled along the week in the peak hours, with cool images and links.<p><i>value proposition:	1
you'll start to have a great presence on the social media channels, attracting fans/followers and engaging them with content that is relevant to them. this way your social media marketing will be effective and can be used to communicate to your customers.<p></i>question:	2
would you pay $20 a month for it?	2012-01-07 15:10:42 UTC		2	0

291587	thoughts about im and social networking: msn messenger and facebook	i wanted to share with you some of my feelings about the way microsoft is responding to facebook and social networking in general. ms tried to put some efforts in social networking (i.e. the recent investment in facebook), but there is a question i've always asked myself: why isn't ms taking advantage of what it already has? i mean msn messenger and all its user base. msn messenger is probably the most used im network worldwide and despites the fact it is truly a social networks, it is still used as pure im application and nothing more. windows live spaces is an effort to provide more services, but honestly, not comparable to facebook. the concept of facebook applications developed by third-parties and beacons (things that made the success of facebook) could easily be implemented in msn messenger by using the current user base data. and one of the great things here is the fact i wouldn't even have to use the web to use the service, because i can rely on my im client installed on my machine. think about receiving becaons or using small applications (like facebook third-party developed applications) directly on the desktop, without even opening the web browser. think about being able to do everything that i can do on facebook today, but directly from my im client!<p>another note: facebook has just introduced instant messaging. here they are providing im as an add-on features of the social network, because they found out the two things marry each other very well. why isn't microsoft marrying the existing infrastructure and user base of im with a social networking platform similar to facebook?<p>what do you think of it?	2

70904	startups sharing office space?	i've been given a lot of advice lately to forgo a traditional office and instruct engineers to work from home and meet together once per week with everyone.<p>do you think other, similarly cash strapped startups would want to share an office? consider this:<p>one firm would rent a small board-room sized space, with perhaps one small executive office. these are available for around $500-1000/month. the space would be shared with about 5-7 other startups, each paying around $100-150/month to use the space once per week. <p>for the firm leasing the office, the space would be almost free. the firms subletting would have access to a very cheap, fully furnished office.<p>does this sound like something people would be interested in? any other thoughts?	2007-10-21 17:56:48 UTC		3	1

2517007	ask hn: how to iterate or a/b test while you have small conversion rates?	so, i have a little side project that's showing some promise and occasionally converting.i want to get down with the a/b testing, of course, because it's been very useful in other projects.<p>problem is, the conversions to sales don't occur often enough to be statistically useful - with one conversion per day on a very good week, from what i understand of a/b testing i'd need to run for about a month to get meaningful statistics. not exactly rapid iteration!<p>so, how can i iterate in this case? it's a single-page sales letter with a "buy" link at the bottom - i guess i could try to capture email addresses initially or even split the pages up, but i'm not sure how statistically relevant the results would be, or if changing my sales model like that would actually reduce conversions!<p>i'm guessing i'm not the only guy in this position. any ideas?	2011-05-05 12:13:19 UTC		10	4
3711832	ask hn: how do the growing number of marketplaces handle outgoing payments?	there seems to be an increase in startups that have two sided payment processing needs.  that is to say they collect money from one party and pay it out to another.  just a few examples include groupon, airbnb, etsy, freelancer, tippr, taskrabbit, uber and odesk.  all affiliate networks, advertising networks and other crowdsourcing marketplaces would fit this description as well.<p>getting a merchant account is a hassle in itself (just to accept incoming payments).  dealing with outgoing payments via bank transfer, cheque, paypal, moneybookers, amazon and others only adds to the complexity.  let alone on an international scale.<p>are there any startups out there offering a service layer that makes the integration of all of these options as simple as a few lines of code?  the upside of this would be that the provider only deals with one central point of contact, their users can choose the most convenient method for payout, that they'd gain instant global reach and have access to an extra level of fraud prevention (screening of users, cross-site analysis, etc.)<p>what startups are currently in a phase that could benefit from this?  i'd imagine this would be startups in a stage of relatively fast growth and users all around the world.<p>[note: a relevant article from nathan at airbnb http://nerds.airbnb.com/do-it-yourself-ach-direct-deposit]	2012-03-16 03:34:56 UTC		10	3

8496846	ask hn: yet another software engineer; help?	i&#x27;m writing this fully aware that i will not be getting any replies on this, and this like my other failures is going to stay at the bottom.	2
i graduated in computers. in the course study we had c and c++ in the first year, and the java for the next two years. so i would say in the least i coded in both the languages to certain extent and i liked it. then after my graduation like all the my friends, i joined a software company. the first few months were hectic, i was trained again in advanced java and ejb. i thought i would work on java in my next years, i couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.<p>if you ever worked for an asian multinational company, you really don&#x27;t have a choice midst thousands of other software engineers. you are to go and work in the department they ask you to.  we in this group work at various tools like hp operator orchestrator, servicenow[1], salesforce etc., meaning pre-packed and developed applications. we customize these tools or applications as per the needs of the customers.	3
i was able to learn the tools easily because an expert in one of the tools, and worked on it for 3 years. in the mean time, i lost all my programming skills. i now don&#x27;t have any programming skills what so ever.i can still write snippets of code, i can visualize and write algorithms in javascript, but i really don&#x27;t know any language. i tried to learn python for a bit, and wasn&#x27;t successful, i gave go a shot and failed again.	1
i&#x27;m at one stage of my life, where i really don&#x27;t know what to do. i know one thing, i don&#x27;t want to work on these &quot;tools&quot; for the rest of my life. i want to learn and develop solid applications.	4
i know some of you are like me, what did you do (or) what method did you follow to go back to development after a stint of bad years?	1
i really don&#x27;t have anybody to guide me. all the seniors i work with have no idea what go is or what git is.	3
help me please, before i completely give up.<p>thank you, for reading.<p>[1] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.servicenow.com&#x2f;	2014-10-23 05:44:57 UTC		10	0

595160	ask hn: moving to a new city	i'll be graduating college in a few weeks.  i'm lucky to have a great job, a great apartment right in the middle of downtown cambridge, and a few friends who will be spending their summer in the boston area, so hopefully the transition won't be too hard.<p>however, i'm still mildly worried about finding things to do, meeting new people, etc.  i'm a fairly social person, but i've had the luxury of being around people my own age on a daily basis for most of my life, and now i'll be the youngest guy at my job by a number of years.  i'm not saying that i won't be able to hang out with my coworkers, but when most of them have kids it may be hard to connect on a personal level.<p>so my question to hn is what advice do you guys have on finding a new circle of people, both in the personal and professional sense, especially after moving somewhere new.  also, if you happen to be from boston i wouldn't object to specific recommendations ;-).<p>thanks!	2009-05-06 04:00:04 UTC		25	1

2088030	i launched 06-10 and constantly feel helpless and lost. what advice do you have?	in 2006, i graduated from college and took a 2 month trip through europe. i realized that travel help was limited to huge corporations that gave outdated info and that there was no one true aggregate for all things travel.<p>i began to build databases, polish my idea, and save up money for programming. in 2008, i had compiled and cleaned up databases for:<p>* embassies worldwide including telephone number, address, url, email, and fax #<p>* airlines including partners, reservation numbers in all countries around the world, and frequent flyer programs. i also went one by one and marked all the low cost carriers in each country.<p>* airports including maps to show proximity to surrounding areas (useful when traveling low cost airlines)<p>i then hired my buddy to do the design and programming. we created a travel blog section where users could create travel scrap books (journals, albums, video embed, plus other features) that also allows you to add places that you have eaten, partied at, and slept in. the idea was to create a 100% user based recommendation system without the big corporate glut of advertising and all that stuff.<p>i now have a product that creates travel guides for countries and individual cities, but without users, it becomes very difficult to grow. i've gotten some feedback from friends and family, but they don't really care to help out much.<p>the idea is two fold:<p>1) have people sign up and add things about their home towns so that other users can travel to that city and have the ability to do touristy things and non-touristy things<p>2) have people sign up and add things they find while they explore the world to help filter out the garbage.<p>my site is http://www.qtripper.com i write articles once in a while and also try to fund the development by having affiliate products that are relevant to what people might want.<p>i spend most of my time attempting to link build and trying to find &#38; fix bugs.<p>i have a bunch of tools i want to add that would be very useful for travelers (pro and newb) but i have minimal funding left and want to focus on marketing.<p>any advice is much appreciated<p>tl;dr i spent all my money developing and have nothing left over to market properly and even if i did i would have no idea what i am doing!	2011-01-10 10:26:20 UTC		27	3

1748522	ask hn:who's looking for a cofounder? (october 2010 edition)	we get a lot of "who's hiring" threads on hn, but i bet many people are looking to join an early stage startup as a cofounder. in your comment, you should probably mention where you're located, what stage your startup/idea is at, who you're looking for, what you can bring to the table, and your contact info.<p>i'm posting this because i'm working on a startup solo, and i think finding a good cofounder is harder than it needs to be.<p>i'll start:<p>i'm working on a saas product to automate buying advertising online, everything from keyword/competitor research to optimization, and i'm looking for a technical cofounder in san francisco. think easy to use enterprise-class ppc management for small businesses.	0
i've built a prototype mvp which got very positive early feedback from potential customers. i can code if i have to, but my strengths are in marketing, optimizing, and the business side. i'm currently bootstrapping the startup, and plan to continue to do so until ramen profitability is reached.	0
if you're excited about making sense of massive datasets using technology like mongodb and node.js, designing the architecture and technical vision of the company, and building the startup from the ground up, i want to talk to you. python hackers who are amazing with regular expressions preferred.<p>email me at ilya [at] unviral.com.	2010-10-01 20:18:46 UTC		52	1

5515123	alert hn: check your gmail auto-forwards, mine have been broken for a month.	last year i had a problem where emails marked as "spam" in gmail were not being forwarded to my main inbox.<p>someone had the same problem and submitted it to hacker news:<p>http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/dont-forward-google-apps-to-gmail.html<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4621571<p>in that topic, rather than use forwarding, someone suggested a negative filter. if an email does not contain a random set of charters, filter it out and forward it.<p>i've been using, also suggested in that topic:<p><pre><code>    -{"x5o!p%@ap[4\pzx54(p^)7cc)7}$eicar-standard-antivirus-test-file!$h+h*"}	3
</code></pre>	0
on or around febuary 22nd, 2013, these filters stopped working. i have not received (in my main inbox) any emails from the alias gmail accounts. they've been sitting in the secondary inbox.<p>this is occurring in at least two forwarding gmail accounts, both starting around feb 22. i did not touch the filter or forwarding settings of either.<p>this is extremely frustrating, as i missed several very important emails.<p>has anyone else had this problem? if you're using filters i encourage you to check your secondary gmail inboxes.	2013-04-08 22:35:53 UTC		1	0

7210776	writing code after 20 years – my own phonegap experience	i&#x27;m 46 years old. i was trained as a software developer in the late 80&#x27;s, graduating in 1992. i learned pascal, c, c++, lisp, scheme and smalltalk. my favorite language was lisp. i was hired as a programmer for my first job but within 6 months i became a product manager. i never had to write code again for my job.<p>fast-forward almost 20 years later, i decided i wanted to build my own mobile app and experience with the whole app store economy. to do that, i learned javascript, jquery, html5 and css3 to build a phonegap app.<p>i studied with http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.w3schools.com until i felt confident enough to go ahead and build my very first mobile app. my training took a full-time month for these 3 languages.<p>i used the http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.telerik.com platform as my coding environment. that saved me hours.<p>it was actually much easier than i thought. coding is like cycling, you never really forget it as long as you were taught algorithmic properly (which i was).<p>i would have never succeeded without the fantastic stackoverflow community though - it seemed like every time i was hitting a dead end, someone had been through the same problem and the answer was always here for me to find.<p>my only struggle was to not know that sql calls from javascript were asynchronous. it took me a good 2 days to figure this out. i had completely forgotten the concept of asynchronous functions so i was not even looking in that direction. everything else was really easy.<p>my app has been on the app store for about 6 months. if you are curious and play poker it&#x27;s here: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.pokerbankrollapp.com&#x2f; i used javascript, jquery, tinysql and php for some back-end processing.<p>i just wanted to share my little experience and i wonder if other people have ever done the same thing?	2014-02-10 13:13:47 UTC		1	0

5869811	geeksphone keons in stock	hy guys,<p>i know some people here are curious to try firefox os. today, i was checking the geeksphone shop and saw that keons are back in stock and decided to share this here.<p>remember that the keon is a low-end device. its not comparable to an iphone or an s3. firefox os devices of that class are aimed at current feature phone users to make them benefit from switching from symbian and bada phones (or crap android phones) to a phone where they have access to the whole web ecosystem.<p>from a developer point of view, developing for the firefox os is extremely fun and refreshing. i recommend that to any developer, its just great. if you&#x27;re already developing html5 based stuff, there is no harm or risk porting it to firefox os anyway.<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;shop.geeksphone.com&#x2f;<p>and for those wanting more development information check out:<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;developer.mozilla.org&#x2f;en-us&#x2f;docs&#x2f;mozilla&#x2f;firefox_os	0

2979140	the hardware is awesome: brief report from san diego power outage	i had a editing job sitting in my gmail, due at 9 am friday, tokyo time. which is 5 pm thursday in san diego. it was going to take about an hour. i had put it off. until 4. which was a really bad time to realize you needed email in san diego.<p>luckily, i had my trusty cr-48, with 3g, and verizon can-you-hear-me-now 3g at that. i had slightly modified my cr-48 with a bigger ssd and running ubuntu, but this is a hardware story. with everything in the house shut down, having used my computer already throughout the day, it fired right, connected to verizon, i downloaded that file, edited it, and had it shipped to tokyo, receipt confirmed. in the middle of the biggest power outage in years.<p>compared to the ipad and our iphones, all on at&#38;t, verizon definitely seemed snappier. both systems were clearly degraded, but at&#38;t pages would just stop loading. verizon, it just felt a little slow.<p>this is a reasonably common use case for me: no power for extended periods, no wi-fi. first at a huge conference, then in japan for fukushima, now here in sunny san dog. the speed of an ssd is trivial to me compared to the energy efficiency. the 3g access is of course critical, though i'll certainly take wi-fi if i can get it.<p>frankly, compared to the macbook air, i'm also glad i have a matte black, plastic case. i'm in the military. shocks and light reflections are non-trivial issues. compared to the stock chromeos, i like not having to rely on the cloud for the computing itself. i'd much rather minimize my reliance on bandwidth. i have cac authentication, so i can check work email, though i still haven't gotten citrix access to our clinical systems. though i think that may be a problem with juniper. even a custom built lps linux hasn't been able to fix that problem. as it stands, this is the most capable piece of hardware i have ever owned, arguably custom made for my use case.	2011-09-09 18:04:47 UTC		1	4

6145224	ask hn: would you pay for screencast weekend projects?	i&#x27;ve been thinking about creating a website that sells screencasts for small weekend projects.<p>the pain i&#x27;m solving is in trying to find discrete, compact tutorials that go over an entire project from beginning to end in detail. you don&#x27;t need anything to start it out, you just clone a standard git repo and watch the video (presumably completing the coding at the same time).<p>each project has a desired functionality and would use a few key libraries so you can learn more about them. an example might be a instant messaging app using socketio, a basic dashboard using d3, a social network using neo4j, etc.<p>the concept is to get people started with these technologies and then assist them in self-learning more about them after the project is finished (which they can continue to work on)<p>i&#x27;d release 1 project a week, on a thu&#x2f;fri, in preparation for users to tackle it sometime on the weekend. the screencasts for a project would be in 2&#x2f;3 parts and total &gt;2hrs of content. you can purchase them for $10 each or sign up for a subscription for $30 a month.<p>stack would vary, language will be mostly javascript.<p>would you guys pay for this kind of product?	2013-08-02 03:48:14 UTC		1	4

206319	the y combinator problem	i thought i'd see if anyone had thoughts on this.  this is a slightly modified version of something i wrote in response to umair haque's recent article discussed here:  http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=203400<p>in order for any of the other hacks haque is concerned with to work, someone needs to hack the vc system and the networking system. here is why hacking the vc system is essential to get any of these other large scale hacks to work.<p>the incestuous networks that surround most vc culture and the amazingly stupid way people pitch to vc's almost guarantees that no interesting solutions are funded. trying to fit the correct solution to a huge problem (or even an adequate discussion of the intricacies of the problem necessary to understanding it well enough to evaluate the idea) into a vc pitch is impossible. any presentation that attempts it will be a wreck.<p>i propose we call this the y combinator problem(1). these people turn solving the worlds problems into a game show that guarantees no deeply needed ideas get through or are discussed seriously. the idea that an idea without implementation is worthless kills innovation and is deeply flawed. it's true most of the time, but, it's not true in exactly the most important cases where the ideas involve solving a huge problem. trying to fit a deeply needed solution to a huge problem into a pitch to a vc is like asking a potential tolstoy to pitch "war and peace" as a haiku (2). the complexity of the problems that most need solving guarantee it is impossible to pitch them in ten minutes or a couple paragraphs of text.<p>indeed, the truth reveals itself that most vc's are satisfied with this good enough system and are not interested in putting the effort to get the best ideas and support them however needed, to solve the biggest problems. if they would they would apply a fractional percentage of the effort they put into paperwork into refining their fatally flawed process, the other solutions would just fall out of that. in fact, it is obvious that they actively inoculate themselves from the best ideas.<p>it's exactly parallel to what happened in physics between einsteinin and newtonian conceptions of physics. the newtonians were right enough to be right most of the time, and they were happy to just keep on doing newtonian physics. but the world isn't like that, and there are problems they will never even possibly solve.<p>also, you must take into account the personalities of the people prone to solve these problems. the same obsessive interests, divergent thought processes and lack of social ability that makes for the most creative problem solvers makes these people unsuited to implement their ideas in the real world (in the same way that einstein did not do the experiments to confirm his theories and got help with math. a quote: "do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. i can assure you mine are still greater.").<p>if you are serious about getting the best answers to the big problems, you need to remove the barriers to entry for the kind of people who solve the biggest problems, and create a channel for them to pitch. you want people who think in pictures or paragraphs or kinesthetic sensations (for example, einstein said he thought with his muscles, and that violin playing related to problem solving). vc's should solve the y combinator problem by creating a way for people with big solutions to huge problems to pitch their idea however they think it should best be pitched (have them write or show, then give the good ones coaching and whatever types of help they need, and find businesspeople who actually want to work with the best ideas to manage the rest.) you need the philosophers and visionaries that are excluded by the design of the good enough system that ends up calcifying it's mediocrity into the economy.<p>until someone solves this fundamental issue, none of the other big problems with will be funded as easily as myspace apps to sell ads to 15 year old girls.<p>solving that problem is the best way to start hacking the industrial economy because it will unleash a torrent of creativity that has been restrained by illogical restrictions that cripple the people historically shown to be most likely to solve the big problems.<p>(1)  as someone or another i read said about cory doctorow, please don't read this as i have a problem with y combinator.  i don't.  i have a y combinator problem	0

484051	ask hn: does it matter that 4k+ follower twitterer uses hn for links (without attribution)?	http://twitter.com/jkrums<p>http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40jkrums+%2b+article<p>i noticed this a while ago. the guy who shot the twitpic-seen-around-the-world (flight 1549 on the hudson) seems to siphon off some hn links and pass them off as his own 'deep web' finds. in his defense, he doesn't change the title - so he's not trying to hide it (totally).<p>i guess i'm a little annoyed that he is using hn as a tool to generate authority links (e.g. feed interesting articles to his twitter followers that will increase his twitter "network"), without participating in the conversation at all (maybe he is anonymous). also, he is running the link through adjix to track his referral count. yes, there are many lurkers on hn (i used to be one).<p>on the other hand, by ambiguation of the source (hn), he is protecting us from an onslaught of news.yc new readers.<p>what do you think? i bring this up because i think the top twitterers feel obligated to supply interesting links to content to their followers. as a full disclosure, my highest-point submission ever - 'best paper airplane' was from a guy kawasaki tweet (i don't follow him - it came up in summize).<p>really, maybe i'm making much ado about tweets here. if no one responds to this (as i presume), i will have my answer (it does not matter).	2009-02-17 03:42:31 UTC		1	3

1742741	document management has improved with sharepoint library … how? 	remember how difficult it was in those early days when in office we had to preserve and work on huge piles of papers? wasn’t it difficult? yes it was. but today with developing technologies, things have become easier and faster. now days, content management, be it in the form of documents, videos, etc., have become hassle-free—thanks to sharepoint server 2010 library!	1
a sharepoint server library is a specialized form of sharepoint lists that are used to store document type data rather than metadata based items. the main difference is that in a normal list the metadata is what defines an item in the list while in a library the document is the main focus. however, libraries do support metadata. libraries are created in much the same way as normal lists and support the same type of functionality such as workflows, event triggers or handlers, various display options, and custom forms for editing or entering data.	2
document library	2
a document library in sharepoint is where you upload your main or core documents. document library comprises a row and column view with links to the documents. thus, whenever the document is updated, the link is created on your site. you can also track metadata of your documents. meta data in sharepoint includes document properties. in the document library, you and your users can design dashboards, reports, charts, and models in excel rather in hard to learn developer tools. you can easily deploy them with spreadsheetgear for .net.	1
video library	0
these days companies need to share more than just documents. from training materials to commercials, companies are accumulating rich media like videos quickly. while sharepoint is pretty good at storing a lot of things, video and audio files have their own needs. sharepoint video library helps you create a centralized location for not only storing videos, but for playing them back and sharing them as well. the sharepoint video library provides several advantages over a standard document library, such as:	4
o an embedded video/audio player that supports multiple file types	2
o the ability to capture and display media metadata (e.g. file type, duration, resolution etc.)	2
o display of video thumbnails	4
o storage of media within the library, or linked to using external sources	3
o ability to share links to videos, or embed them into another page	0
the sharepoint video library provides users with a simple but powerful library that is custom made for storing media. authorized users can upload or link to video and audio files in a variety of formats and locations, while other users can view details (like resolution and length), and playback the content from within the library using the embedded player.	1
so, hitherto if you were facing issues with document or content management at your workplace or anywhere then you know now what to look for.  take advantage of the advanced features included in the sharepoint family of products that include sharepoint foundation 2010, microsoft office sharepoint server, and numerous free sharepoint templates and web parts.	2010-09-30 09:37:19 UTC		1	0

1661111	spanish speaking call center	costa rica's call center (ccc) is a state of the art telemarketing outsourcing call center located in the capital city of san jose, costa rica in central america. our bilingual call centers primary objective is to personally fulfill your need of key bpo call center telemarketing services. the main focus of every bpo outsourcing campaign will always be to personally educated and enhance the skills and every call center agent so that we may give superior quality of outbound and inbound telemarketing solutions to small and medium sized international companies, entrepreneurs as well as fortune 500 companies.<p>the costa rican call center outsourcing industry keeps growing that has produced a highly competitive outsourcing market with many choices depending on price and service. our advantage, as a bilingual call center located in costa rica, can be clearly seen as a closer proximity to the united states, central time zone and spanish language capability as an added value are now considered almost basic requirements when making an important choice on which bpo call center to use for your important project. most importantly, if the call center software can support the needs of a client when their outsourced campaign grows? leaving this to chance is not even an option anymore when choosing where to outsource. call center software is as important to an outsourced campaign as telemarketing training. both areas must be reliable, secure and capable of out performing the other call centers that you are currently considering to outsource your bpo campaign.<p>our niche is that costa ricas call center presents any company that has chosen to outsource a practical benefit by providing more than twice the number of extremely well trained and educated bilingual call center agents for the same money as they would be forced to spend within their local area. in addition, individuals that outsource can rightfully benefit from the international tax laws granted to international companies that invest in costa rica and its growing economy. the clear amount of the savings and financial benefits will make outsourcing to costa rica a very wise and strategic business decision on your part and for your organization.<p>the high demand for call center services has provided our company with an abundance of respectable resumes of qualified telemarketers that want to work with and for you. by outsourcing agents overseen by highly trained bpo managers and call center supervisors can give your business a proven method of expanding or staying in close contact with your existing customer base. outsourcing to costa rica eliminates the additional pressure and invested time needed by you in order to interview, qualify, hire and train telemarketers by yourself.<p>in addition, unlike other large and traditional call centers situated far away in india and the philippines, costa ricas call center stays focused on only handling up to one hundred call centers agents in one call center at a time. as soon as capacity is reached, an additional identical call center will be formed with the same structure and business plan in order to keep our call center results and expectations consistently higher than that of the competition. our companys strategy is to take the time to handle one project at a time, in order to successfully manage quality control and analyzing each call center agents phone technique and presentation. your outsourced campaign deserves a strong commitment to continue an optimistic employee self-confidence so each call center agent continues to make a difference and have create value to your company.<p>costa rica has a very solid infrastructure , stable democratic government, very competitive labor costs and a call center job pool that is especially familar to the north american culture. many of the offshore call center agents used today are bilingual in their native middle eastern or asian language which is very difficult to the north american ear. whereas spanish is more beneficial and clearly a practical solution as a second language for potentially large untapped markets t throughout the north, central and south american populations as well as those countries where spanish is either a primary or secondary language. this aspect alone has made costa rica a very attractive near-shore outsourcing solution call center jobs are some of the top paying career opportunities in costa rica. this differs greatly from other countries that consider it as a starting position in a dead end company. turnover at these other locations are five to ten times more than in costa rica.<p>we encourage you to visit one of our call centers on your next personal vacation or business trip to central america's paradise, costa rica. while you are here, we would recommend taking an extra day of your trip to visit breathtaking virgin beaches, play golf next to the ocean, try your luck at deep sea fishing, explore tropical jungles, climb volcanos or just relax in natural hot springs. come and see for yourself why call center outsourcing in costa rica is a perfect solution for your growing company and a powerhouse in the bpo industry.<p>http://www.outsourcingtocostarica.com/page_builder.php?page=index.php	2010-09-03 20:49:56 UTC	http://www.SPANISHSPEAKINGCALLCENTER.COM 	1	1

4506763	ask hn: i fail at trick interview questions. what to do?	i'm a very experienced hacker with a truly impressive track record of sophisticated projects to my name. i'm the proverbial rock-star/ninja/guru everyone is looking for. i've worked on everything from optimizing compilers to high-end web apps, led teams, ran my own business, contributed widely to open source projects. in other words, i know i can deliver the goods.<p>it's not often that i interview for jobs. when i do, i tend to ace the conversational part of the interview - i'm confident, knowledgeable and fun to talk to. but when it comes to the famous "trick interview question", i pretty consistently fail. it's not just that i get nervous and confused, but i literally find myself unable to deal with challenges that would be a joke in normal day-to-day work. i think it's a combination of anxiety and some kind of undiagnosed sort of dyslexia (in my day-to-day life i never do anything "on paper", without a computer).<p>as a result, i fail to get job offers from places i really want to work at, and where i'm pretty certain i could make an excellent hire. i end up being limited to those places where the hiring managers are willing to overlook my failure at the trick questions. it's not a huge problem - i always get something interesting to do, but obviously, my choice is much more constrained than it should be.<p>any ideas?	2012-09-11 17:42:02 UTC		1	0

2663089	ask hn: specific intel. prop. question for employed programmers	note: posting from a new account for obvious reasons.<p>dear hn,	4
i need clarification on a specific intellectual property (ip) issue as it pertains to employed programmers and their part-time million-dollar startups.<p>background:<p>* i'm a programmer working at software company (not in california).<p>* any ip i create is encumbered by a set of textbook (typical) employment clauses that assign all employee-created ip to the company.<p>* i wish to scale up my part-time startup endeavors. i've had a few moderate successes so far, but have a new great idea and need to resolve the ip issues before making any real, documented progress.<p>i just finished reading a book on this topic, and after pouring through the postings on hn and elsewhere, i've come to the conclusion that the best way to proceed is to be open with my employer and get their waiver of ip ownership.<p>my question:	1
so, i would like to be open with the company and get permission before working on my next big idea.<p>i have a very good relationship with the company executives, and i can see the following scenario unfolding:	3
scenario:<p>1) i send an email to a manager in which i state my interest in pursuing a side business. i specifically state my concern over ip ownership issues and my honest assessment that these activities are unrelated to the business's current or foreseeable future concerns.<p>2) i receive an email response acknowledging and approving this outside work.	2
my question: does this email (from a c-level executive) constitute a waiver of the company's ip rights generated in the course of my outside work?<p>summary: as a programmer seeking permission to freely own ip generated outside my employer's business activities, does a company exective's acknowledgement and/or approval of these activities (after i've specifically stated my concerns over ip ownership) constitute a legal waiver of the company's claims to the ip?	2011-06-16 20:29:01 UTC		2	2

customer development	2
ux	1
lean analytics	3

growth hacking<p>most courses focus on one or the other, either teaching development in a piece meal sort of way or only teaching lean startup concepts such as growth hacking.<p>but i think many people learning to code, ultimately are interested in building a product of their own. rather than creating a course yourself by patching together online tutorials and books, i think a comprehensive and cohesive online course would be more ideal.<p>what are your thoughts?<p>thanks very much	2015-08-23 19:36:36 UTC		2	2

6921272	ask hn: how to decide which language to use for my life dream?	i want to finally start the web app that i always dreamed of doing. my hope is that it will become my startup and eventually my life mission. when this is what i&#x27;m aiming at, i find it very hard deciding what language to use...<p>i&#x27;m pretty determined to start with google app engine (and maybe later move to compute engine) so it leaves me with 4 options really. here are the pro&#x2f;cons of using them:<p>1. java: my comfort zone. it will take me relatively little time to get going because i have the most experience with this choice. also, it&#x27;s a solid choice in terms of performance.<p>2. php: my other comfort zone. it will be the fastest to make a working prototype, so why not really? since it&#x27;s app engine, i don&#x27;t need to worry about scaling it. but then again, i don&#x27;t like writing php...<p>3. python: i don&#x27;t have much experience, and besides i don&#x27;t really see any advantage for python over php. the plus: if my site fails, it will be good to learn python...<p>4. go: it would be really cool... but it&#x27;s experimental, and i&#x27;m not so sure how much time it will take me to take care of basics such as templating and user management...	2013-12-17 14:35:30 UTC		2	3

1320034	ask hn: jvm templating engines? looking for jsp alternatives	for the first time, i'm building a jvm-based web app. i'm looking for a good replacement for jsps. i've used rails and django extensively and like both their templating engines quite a bit - probably because of this experience jsp makes me want to gag a bit.<p>i've look briefly at velocity but the perlish '$' syntax puts me off - though i could probably get over that.<p>notably it only has to play friendly with java - groovy, clojure, scala, are all viable options. i'm also considering using jruby and just sticking with the erb i know.<p>thanks.	2010-05-05 01:31:44 UTC		2	3
8196164	ask hn: how to build my own crowdsource/distributed computing?	i am looking to build my own network of crowd workers that will require installing chrome extension, and do some distributed computing.<p>the problem is amazon is restricted to us and i don&#x27;t know of other places where they will let users install a chrome extension (in chrome store) in order to do the job, so my only alternative is now to figure out how to build my own crowd to do the specific task.<p>bigger challenge is, i&#x27;m not sure where to find people to join and work on my jobs, the thing that is special is that you can leave on your computer and get paid for the computation hours, so if you leave your computer on, and your computer is used for crunching lot of numbers, you get paid. you also get paid on top of that for manual user input. in total, i think i can offer people 1 bucks per computer per hour, depending on how many computers you have running available.	2014-08-19 05:57:52 UTC		2	3

2399867	nfc data dump: part i	nfc technology and concepts sprang from rfid (a family of technology itself, operating across 4 very different frequencies) technology. rfid emerged originally as a replacement for barcodes in the supply chain. the metrics of focus within the supply chain  were on read range and tag_reads/ second. nfc operates at 13.56mhz.  in rfid, you had the reader that was powered, and the tag which was a powerless inductor with a eeprom chip attached. the reader is the transceiver, the tag is a transponder. nfc turned this paradigm on its head-&#62; the transceiver/ transponder were one. in iso rfid standards, you had iso 15693 and iso 18000-3 that focused on the supply chain; and, iso 14443a and 14443b which focused on security/ data rate -&#62;payment-&#62;passport. sony purposed a 14443c standard for the felica chip, but that failed. nfc technology only works within a range of 4 inches (10cm) by standard, but 2 inches in reality.<p>i've got a ton more knowledge about nfc, but i don't want to spam hn if there is no interest. if there is interest, i can go into silicon mfgs and device mfgs  (like vivotech, about to go ipo)	2011-04-02 13:35:18 UTC		2	1

7622953	ask hn: best summer jobs for a computer science student?	i didn&#x27;t get in to google summer of code so i need to find other ways to make money over the summer.  i would love to do something related to programming but still am only in my fourth quarter as a computer science major.  i know a little visual basic, a little python, and a fair amount of java (currently taking the third java class in my curriculum).  would it be possible for me to find an actual short-term programming job at my skill level?  should i just check craigslist &quot;gigs&quot; to see if there are projects i can complete?  should i solicit companies to see if they&#x27;d have a position for me?  i&#x27;ve always had really good relationships with previous bosses so i could probably talk to my previous companies for work in it but i don&#x27;t really know much about sysadmin stuff and that area doesn&#x27;t interest me.	2014-04-21 19:03:00 UTC		4	0

(couldn't find one for inkscape, though).<p>maybe a good approach would be to sketch the design with a pencil, then try to mimic the design with code?<p>what would be a good environment for scripting graphics? probably targeting svg would be good...	2010-03-16 10:50:49 UTC		5	2

2720845	ask hn: startup records local hdtv, offers online dvr. i forget the name?	and i completely forgot the name. sorry to turn to hn for something like this, but for the life of me, my google-fu is failing.<p>the gist is that you pay them, and they dvr your local over-the-air programming, and let you access it online. the name was very soft-sounding, and not a word. akin to "hulu" in that regard.<p>i first found mention of it here, and now i'm blanking. anyone recall it offhand?	2011-07-02 02:16:59 UTC		5	0

393079	ask hn: finding a job for the rest of my life	i’m facing a dilemma. how do i find a job i could love for the rest of my life? one that keeps me interested, fulfilled, happy, content. or, alternatively, what can i do to make money that will let me be me on my own time. its come to the time in my life when i need to take a sincere look at where my life is heading, and how i plan on living it. some people call it growing up.<p>i’ve been slowly on a mission to discover things about myself. why i don’t like certain things, what things i really love. the only problem is, the result doesn’t provide a clear solution to the problem of what i should try doing with my life.<p>the things i’ve discovered:<p>i love learning. it goes beyond mere excitement and borders on a psychological need. maybe that is the wrong word, it is a need. i could go to school for the rest of my life. i ache to go back to classes, just for the idea that to sit in them would be fun. even in my college days i hardly skipped class. i didn’t always do the homework, but i went to class anyways. i would read through my textbooks for fun. i go to the library and read books about subjects i don’t really need to know. i read in general, and i love every minute of it. i love exploring new places just to see them and eating new foods just because i wonder what its like to try them.<p>i would describe myself as a polymath, but that implies a certain amount of acclaimed accomplishment that goes along with the learning. taking the time to be famous at something has never appealed to me, mostly because that time could be used to learn something new. but one of the best days in my intellectual life was finding the definition of that word, because it meant i was not alone in the world and that other people were like me.<p>i love thinking through problems. it’s the one thing i’m not humble about, i’m good at it. thinking excites me, and thinking through things incites me more. i originally wrote “solve problems.” but that isn’t true. i love thinking of the solutions. but once the solution is thought of, i become disinterested. it requires someone else to put the solution into effect. to build the gadget, write-up the paper, complete the process. the problem is solved in my mind, but until someone else does the work it can’t really be said to be truly solved. but the thinking, ah, the thinking. that is truly where my mind can expand, can envision. i’m definitely a vision guy. i ask way too many questions, but i’m extremely good at throwing away useless information and working out a way to solve something, to get somewhere, to chose a path that will likely work.<p>i hate writing. i hate it with a mix of guilt and resignation. it took me forever to find this out, but again, it was such a relief. every time i realized i did not like what i was doing, it was this. school was a blast until the night before papers were due. tests? sure, love em. studying, of course! but papers? writing? that’s where i get bogged down. i finally figured out that it was the only thing i ever procrastinated on. why? because deep down i don’t like it. i end up disliking the jobs i have when writing becomes heavily involved. my thoughts have already moved on, they’re going new places and solving new problems. putting the old thoughts into writing both bores and paralyzes me.<p>so what should i do with my life? how do i find something that will fulfill me? i’ve thought of academics. being in a constant learning environment would be fun. i’ve though of those idea companies, where you solve problems, but i admit to a problem with execution. they both want you to solve the problem and execute the solution. i know i’ll hate those parts. so what’s out there for me?<p>i have found one thing that works, and that’s to take drudgery work. i worked in a factory, and i didn’t mind it. my current occupation is a big step up, i make a ton more money, but it’s the same. you do the same thing over and over for hours. its enough that i can play close attention to what i need to do, but at the same time a little part of my brain can be thinking through things, solving little problems, or just dreaming up big ideas. it allows me to be me and still make the money i need. by the way, it not that i’m lazy. i’ve worked my share of long hours, both in factories during school and in my current occupation. i don’t mind the long hours as long as i don’t mind the work.<p>sorry this is so long. thank you to everyone who replies.	2008-12-10 16:25:39 UTC		6	4

852893	ask hn: motivating projects to learn functional programming languages?	i've always wanted to learn a language like haskell, lisp, erlang, etc., but i've never been able to motivate myself beyond the first few examples because i haven't found a way to apply it. i've found that the best way i learn is to pick up a project and learn the language/tools/api as i go along — it's strange, but it's much easier for me to lose myself working on a project than an academic exercise. i start putting all the pieces together and eventually everything just "clicks"; i reach an epiphany and can start thinking in the language.<p>can anyone else relate to this? how do you learn less "practical" languages like these?	2009-09-30 16:37:00 UTC		7	2

it gives you a place to store interesting wikihow articles and yes, they are converted into todo lists.<p>i know this site is not that good, but i still need your guys' feedback.<p>for example, as i am a non english native speaker, you can simply put "your english suck!"	3

4050020	tell hn: sql injection vulnerability in latest ruby on rails	from the rails security list:<p>there is a sql injection vulnerability in active record, version 3.0	2
and later. this vulnerability has been assigned the cve identifier	1
cve-2012-2661.<p>versions affected:  3.0.0 and all later versions<p>not affected:       2.3.14<p>fixed versions:     3.2.4, 3.1.5, 3.0.13<p>impact<p>------<p>due to the way active record handles nested query parameters, an	1
attacker can use a specially crafted request to inject some forms of	0
sql into your application's sql queries.<p>all users running an affected release should upgrade immediately.<p>impacted code directly passes request params to the `where` method of	2
an activerecord class like this:<p><pre><code>   post.where(:id =&#62; params[:id]).all	4
</code></pre>	2
an attacker can make a request that causes `params[:id]` to return a	1
specially crafted hash that will cause the where clause of the sql	3
statement to query an arbitrary table with some value.<p>releases<p>--------<p>the fixed releases are available at the normal locations.<p>workarounds<p>-----------<p>this issue can be mitigated by casting the parameter to an expected	4
value.  for example, change this:<p><pre><code>   post.where(:id =&#62; params[:id]).all	1
</code></pre>	4
to this:<p><pre><code>   post.where(:id =&#62; params[:id].to_s).all</code></pre>	2012-05-31 19:58:44 UTC		8	3

2349870	show hn: my open search index project, success or failure	i started working on stumpedia.com about 3 years ago and am having a difficult time try to determine if this project is worth pursing any further.  my biggest problem is lack of resources since i am not a developer nor have the funding to pay for further development or marketing.  there are currently active users and all traffic and engagement indicators are pointing up, and this is what makes it both confusing and frustrating for me.  my dilemma is should i just leave the site alone and let it take its course, should i try to sell it now and recoup some of my initial investment, should i hand it over to the open-source community, should i give it away to someone who has the resources and desire to continue the project, or should i just shut it down since this concept is not going to work and i'm wasting my time.<p>curious to know what some of you would do if you were in my position and this was your project?<p>some side notes:	1

7828873	ask hn: how did you find the courage to try again?	i really could use a gandalf right now...<p>i&#x27;m 24 and from atlanta, georgia. i grew up playing with legos and computers. i began to dream of building a &quot;world changing&quot; startup at 17 motivated by the problems i saw in the american education system. i started learning design and code to build a mvp before my 20th birthday. i gave up before launching after seeing projects like khan academy, knewton, and coursera come out. the domain i owned was www.academiia.com, my original choice was already owned and the guy wanted at least $100,000. at least i learned a lot before starting college...<p>after that, i took on a design and marketing job at myriann (www.myriann.com) while taking classes at a community college. i worked on talkhotels.com and roomsailor.com among many other projects. i had to leave because i felt burnt out from working on things that didn&#x27;t excite me. i had notebooks full of ideas and ui&#x27;s for problems that should be solved but haven&#x27;t been by the looks of hn and twitter. i knew i couldn&#x27;t waste any more time not living my dreams...<p>i quit the job and dropped out to take some time off to &quot;collect myself&quot; and in the process went through depression, a bad breakup, and even suicidal thoughts knowing that i had nothing to live for if i couldn&#x27;t help solve world problems through my technology. i thought i&#x27;d missed my chance because all the great founders were way ahead of me at this age, that no investor wants someone outside of california and nyc, and without a degree no one would give me a job if all else fails. unhealthy thinking looking back in hindsight.<p>right now, i work at a financial company working on the hardware and software for atm machines. i study design and code for hours every day because some new ideas i have keep me up at night like when i first started on this path. i don&#x27;t want to go back to school and waste more time. i want to save enough and apply for app academy or something similar as a fall back plan. i just have to be a player on the field and not a spectator in the stands. my soul will be crushed if i don&#x27;t realize my potential.<p><i></i><i></i>how did you get back up after failing? after seeing other people create what you envisioned? after burnout? after seeing all the media about brogrammers and sexism? with the neverending talks of a coming bubble?<i></i><i></i> please help a brother out. i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one needing some guidance. thanks.	2014-06-01 11:58:42 UTC		10	0

193545	where are the unhappy founders?	[excuse a belated post about startup school]<p>i've been mulling over the differences between  yc startup school and academic conferences.  startup school left me with a feeling i have not experience before....  it's hard to fully articulate, but perhaps "thrilling" is the best adjective.  founders i met dream big, they're excited, and those feelings are contagious.<p>am i crazy?  are startup founders really as excited as perceived?  my primary fear is a selection effect.  those interested and excited in startups, attend things like startup school, those who feel bitter, tired, or bored with startups, don't.<p>still, the same could be said of academic conferences, yet, i have never felt the same air of excitement at one.  why?  am i missing something?  did anyone else experience the same sensation?  anyone interested in sharing their thoughts?<p>i'm utterly confused.  it's easy to drone on with my own hyperbole here.  i guess i'd rather hear yours.  :)	2008-05-18 19:36:53 UTC		23	4

of your information which occurred on december 17th. on this date, we	0
were informed by a 3rd party who discovered a file with individual user	0

the file off the server and investigated all downloads. we have	2
identified all the downloads and with the exception of the 3rd party,	0
who reported this issue, the file has been download by only mozilla	2
staff.  this file was placed on this server by mistake and was a partial	2
representation of the users database from addons.mozilla.org. the file	2
included email addresses, first and last names, and an md5 hash	0
representation of your password. the reason we are disclosing this event	0
is because we have removed your existing password from the addons site	0
and are asking you to reset it by going back to the addons site and	3
clicking forgot password. we are also asking you to change your password	4
on other sites in which you use the same password. since we have	1
effectively erased your password, you don't need to do anything if you	3
do not want to use your account.  it is disabled until you perform the	4
password recovery.<p>we have identified the process which allowed this file to be posted	4
publicly and have taken steps to prevent this in the future. we are also	1
evaluating other processes to ensure your information is safe and secure.<p>should you have any questions, please feel free to contact the	4

573582	scientists discover earth-sized planet outside our solar system	hatfield, england (ap) — in the search for earth-like planets, astronomers zeroed in tuesday on two places that look awfully familiar to home. one is close to the right size. the other is in the right place.<p>european researchers said they not only found the smallest exoplanet ever, called gliese 581 e, but realized that a neighboring planet discovered earlier, gliese 581 d, was in the prime habitable zone for potential life.<p>ads by google<p>april foreclosure list<p>fha foreclosures and hud homes $1 for a 15-day pass<p>www.currentforeclosures.com<p>157+ south florida fixers<p>better than foreclosures, hud homes buy with $0 down and bad credit.<p>www.myhousedeals.com/southflorida<p>foreclosed homes for sale<p>find homes - up to 50% below market value. search now for free!<p>www.foreclosure.com	3
"the holy grail of current exoplanet research is the detection of a rocky, earth-like planet in the 'habitable zone,'" said michel mayor, an astrophysicist at geneva university in switzerland.<p>an american expert called the discovery of the tiny planet "extraordinary."<p>gliese 581 e is only 1.9 times the size of earth — while previous planets found outside our solar system are closer to the size of massive jupiter, which nasa says could swallow more than 1,000 earths.<p>gliese 581 e sits close to the nearest star, making it too hot to support life. still, mayor said its discovery in a solar system 20½ light years away from earth is a "good example that we are progressing in the detection of earth-like planets."<p>scientists also discovered that the orbit of planet gliese 581 d, which was found in 2007, was located within the "habitable zone" — a region around a sun-like star that would allow water to be liquid on the planet's surface, mayor said.<p>he spoke at a news conference tuesday at the university of hertfordshire during the european week of astronomy and space science.<p>gliese 581 d is probably too large to be made only of rocky material, fellow astronomer and team member stephane udry said, adding it was possible the planet had a "large and deep" ocean.<p>"it is the first serious 'water-world' candidate," udry said.<p>mayor's main planet-hunting competitor, geoff marcy of the university of california, berkeley, praised the find of gliese 581 e as "the most exciting discovery" so far of exoplanets — planets outside our solar system.<p>"this discovery is absolutely extraordinary," marcy told the associated press by e-mail, calling the discoveries a significant step in the search for earth-like planets.<p>while gliese 581 e is too hot for life "it shows that nature makes such small planets, probably in large numbers," marcy commented. "surely the galaxy contains tens of billions of planets like the small, earth-mass one announced here."<p>nearly 350 planets have been found outside our solar system, but so far nearly every one of them was found to be extremely unlikely to harbor life.<p>most were too close or too far from their sun, making them too hot or too cold for life. others were too big and likely to be uninhabitable gas giants like jupiter. those that are too small are highly difficult to detect in the first place.<p>both gliese 581 d and gliese 581 e are located in constellation libra and orbit around gliese 581.<p>like other planets circling that star — scientists have discovered four so far — gliese 581 e was found using the european southern observatory's telescope in la silla, chile.<p>the telescope has a special instrument which splits light to find wobbles in different wavelengths. those wobbles can reveal the existence of other worlds.<p>"it is great work and shows the potential of this detection method," said lisa kaltenegger, an astronomer at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics.	2009-04-22 05:49:05 UTC	http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-eu-britain-new-planet,1,266082.story	1	1

1) why do you suppose google is removing support for ie6, rather than just forcing ie6 users to install the chrome frame plug-in?	3
2) is there any reason why i shouldn't just force ie6 users to use chrome frame?<p>i'm surprised how little discussion of this i've been able to find on the web.	2010-01-30 20:17:53 UTC		1	3

4419589	ask hn: feedback on business idea -- upscale indian food ramen style	i want to start a line of indian food, kinda like ramen noodles, but better. the concept is simple but i want some feedback on the concept. also, if you are near palo alto, ca, you can pick up 5 of my lunch pouches for free in exchange for your feedback; i can accommodate up to 10 people for this free-lunch offer. my email address is in my profile.<p>the details:<p>-	you will get a small pouch of good quality indian food with lots of vegetables.<p>-	the food will be vacuum dried like ramen noodles. just add water, microwave for 2 minutes and eat. bowl &#38; spoon not included.<p>-	the food will be tasty, nutritionally balanced (unlike ramens that are very low in nutrition and very high in salt), and filling.<p>-	low salt, zero cholesterol, low fat, high fiber, full of vitamins, lots of vegetable protein.<p>-	only whole grains and organic ingredients. no meat, eggs or fish – so more eco-friendly. could contain nuts and milk products. absolutely no preservatives.<p>-	sample menu for a week (5 lunches):<p>o	three-grain soup with dark greens – spinach, kale and mustard<p>o	couscous with spicy peas, carrots and potatoes.<p>o	cumin rice with chick peas, green beans and red onion.<p>o	semolina soup with spicy lentils.<p>o	aromatic fenugreek leaves on a bed of cracked whole wheat.<p>i know that you can not give me feedback on the taste of the food without tasting it. but you can give me feedback on the business idea. what would you pay to have this kind of food delivered via usps at work or at home 1-2-3-4-5 times a week. one dollar per meal? two dollars? three dollars? four dollars? five dollars?<p>i am thinking of charging $25 for 5 lunches, delivered every monday morning via usps priority mail anywhere in the usa.	2012-08-22 21:10:06 UTC		1	0

5129604	open source projects or nonprofit volunteering?	as engineers (or any other profession for that matter) we have a lot of spare cycles , be it on weekends or other days. i've always felt the need to use my skills as a techie to somehow contribute to non-profits or other projects that can have a positive impact on society. but then there's always the next open source project to contribute to.	2
i wanted to reach out to the hn community to ask them how they best use spare time to contribute to other projects or organizations. whether they work solely on open source projects or take time out to help out non-profits with certain projects too ?	2
maybe this way i'll get some ideas which projects/people/organizations to approach to help out.	2013-01-28 17:53:13 UTC		1	4

7957984	ask hn: found my stolen camera, but the police doesn't want to collect it.	hey, guys,	3
i had my camera stolen in the middle of february in london. back at the time, i was looking for it around ebay and gumtree for the next couple of months with no success.<p>on the 5th of june, i thought of searching again on www.stolencamerafinder.com and this time the search returned one result, i was able to track down the individual and now have his facebook, flickr, 500px and blogspot accounts, with proof that he is in possession (and possibly has stolen) my camera.<p>since i couldn&#x27;t locate him by myself, i&#x27;ve filed a report on the 6th of june and have been emailing and calling patiently several times the metropolitan police department. unfortunately, even though the case is solved, i have proof of ownership, proof that he&#x27;s in possession of a stolen property of mine, they are very slow to respond and the 2nd officer, my case has been delegated to, hasn&#x27;t done anything to collect the camera for about 12-13 days.<p>i&#x27;ve lost hope in the system, but haven&#x27;t lost complete hope of recovering my camera, as the guy doesn&#x27;t seem to be hiding and may or may not have stolen it himself. this is to be proved, but it&#x27;s a fact, that he&#x27;s in possession of a stolen property of mine.<p>please reply here or to my email whatever-it-takes at live dot com. thank you!	2014-06-28 11:48:38 UTC		1	1

10028994	would anyone consider sponsoring me for the 2-year make school program?	the program works by allowing students to pay for their make school education a percentage from their salary for two years after the program. if i can pay up front, i would have reduced overall expenses. if someone would consider it, i would like to talk to someone or a company who would be interested in working out a deal. possibly contract work or part time employment for the next two years or something like that. i am open to suggestions.	2015-08-08 23:49:51 UTC		1	4

5247342	ask hn: outdoor readable screens/tablets?	in an attempt to disrupt an industry that is stuck in pen-and-paper-and-camera world, i need laptops or tablets that are usable outdoor.<p>not direct-sunlight outdoor, just sitting-in-the-shade or sitting-in-the-car outdoor. there are outdoor screen laptop models from hp, lenovo and others (for $100-$200 more than the basic model), but they still don't make the laptops really usable outside on sunny days.<p>eink is out of the question for now, because i do need the ability to show detailed color photos and short movie clips (and possibly edit them) to disrupt said industry.<p>the way this industry works right now is take photos or videos with camera (they've only switched from film/tapes to digital in the last 3 years!), take notes on paper or tape recorder, and then go back to the office to process everything. if they could do the work sitting an in improvised shade outside, they would much more effective.<p>i've almost given up on finding a device that can actually be used outdoors for real work - but perhaps someone int he hn community knows of one?<p>alternatively, do you have experience with any hacks like hoods or screen protectors or sunglasses that actually make outdoors work feasible? my experience with these so far is "nice concept, execution fail", but perhaps yours is different?	2013-02-19 22:00:33 UTC		1	3

6256079	ask hn: blog series - 17 years of an internet "startup". interesting?	we started as a classical web development and hosting company back in 1996. almost right from the beginning i started to write a kind of &quot;company log&quot; to record all kinds of information about our team, projects, customers, partners, lessons learned etc.&lt;p&gt;although it&#x27;s not a spectacular story, we had some interesting highs and lows over the years. i&#x27;m currently considering making a &quot;little&quot; blog post series out of it, because it can be quite funny, sometimes yet exciting, to read such stories with a personal touch. (they also include many business lessons we had to learn.)&lt;p&gt;but that&#x27;s just my own opinion. so what do you think about a project like that? would such a &quot;long-term study blog series&quot; be interesting for you, too?&lt;p&gt;thanks for your feedback!	2013-08-22 09:23:57 UTC		1	2

3880703	ask hn: real-time conversation engine	often when someone with a large following (i.e. robert scoble, tim ferriss) asks a question on twitter/fb/g+, there is a large interesting conversation that starts. however, it's disjointed across networks and disorganized - some great signal hidden in a huge amount of noise. also in twitter's case, the responses don't update in real-time.<p>i'm thinking about building a service that lets you start a discussion, share it on all of your networks, and link to a page with real-time responses that aggregates responses across networks and would allow upvoting/downvoting to bubble the best responses to the top.<p>would you be interested in a service like this, either as a follower or a conversation starter?	2012-04-23 20:10:12 UTC		2	0

3934136	tools don't matter...it's the way you use them that does	there was once a young apprentice named julius. he was a painter in some far away land.	4
his master alavis gave him a set of basic brushes. "go and paint the most beautiful flower that you can find." - he said, while pointing towards the door.	4
julius took the brushes and walked out. he decided that the most beautiful flower would be found in the forrest. and he was right.	1
for hours, julius painted and painted. he stroked the brushes from side to side. sometimes angry, and others with patience.	2
nightfall came and julius was exhausted. the painting was not finished. he walked back to his master and slammed open the door.	4
"you have given me bad brushes. i have not been able to paint anything with them" -said julius with an angry tone.	2
"those brushes are the same ones i used to paint my most coveted paintings. they are very good." -said alavis with the kind of tone that only a wise man can have.	4
"tools do not matter. it is what you do with them, julius. go back tomorrow and the day after. keep returning until you paint something that makes the flower justice." -said alavis.	0
"but you have only taught me the basics" - said julius.	2
"yes. it is now up to you to learn how to use them properly. only by painting every day will you improve." -said alavis.	1
"but i should only paint that one flower?" -asked julius.	2
"flowers have short lifespans. when that one says goodbye find another." -answered alavis.	3
and so, julius went on to paint many beautiful flowers. each more elegant than the last. he never quit.	4

2091959	ask hn: optimizing conversion rates for downloads	greetings hackers/entrepreneurs,<p>i'm the product/ux guy at gameground (www.gameground.com), a startup aiming to create a lot of new engagement in games across many game platforms. i'd greatly appreciate any advice, tips or sources of information you can offer me for the following.<p>1) we are currently monitoring the funnel and a/b testing various copy/layouts in our app download and installation process. in general, any best practices or learnings from experience re:communication/ux for optimizing download conversion rates? how would you "couch" a download (albeit a small one) if you knew it was a necessary step in the user funnel? (gameground is a web app that works in tandem with a desktop app)<p>2) gameground's ux involves a desktop app, but the website does live on its own. any experience or data indicating that the app download should be part of the registration process or after the user enters the site? in one case you might hurt the registration step in the funnel and in another you might hurt the download step.<p>some background: unlike other products i've worked on in the past, the gameground ux is part website and part lightweight desktop app. the two work hand-in-hand simultaneously. the desktop app automatically saves your scores in games you play on the web, your pc, and console. it also shows you a game summary at the end of any session highlighting your scores, new rank, and what to achieve next.  the website displays your scores and accomplishments and allows you to compare and compete with friends. you can also launch games from the website, but you don't have to - the app still saves your scores and rewards your progress.<p>sorry for the lengthiness here. i look forward to hearing your comments.<p>thanks in advance.	2011-01-11 14:36:37 UTC		4	3

5081335	ask hn: how to not lose yourself in perfectionism creating a developer profile?	i guess i'm doing what most people did before the rise of blogs, github and social media. stuff whatever i wrote in some folder, have code rot on some hard drive and receive mail to my yahoo address ending in four numbers and just hope the interviewer solely relies on employment history.<p>that doesn't fly these days. maybe i'm taking everything too serious, but leaving some kind of mark on the internet seems so complicated and doesn't allow for experimentation. everything is connected somehow and often it's impossible to change things you're not so happy about.<p>i did a lot of commits and bug reports with throwaway accounts and mails. contributing things anonymous is still a good thing, but somehow feels wrong and doesn't add anything to how people perceive my skill or character.<p>here's one chain of thought:<p>"i should really put my code online. i set the maila dress in my git repository to "&#60;&#62;" but i can still change that now, but not later. well i can't use tomatonose384@yahoo.com but every good name is already in use, so what to do? maybe i should get a domain first. damn, every good name is already in use. but i can't commit now because people might end up relying on my commit history or even fork it before i can change it, if i ever come up with something better. forget about that first, what about my writings? static pages on github are cheap, oh wait we run into the same problem. and what if we ever move to our own webspace, urls will be doomed! well, could get some webspace, need a domain anyway. <i>hundred cups of coffee later</i> that domain sounds dumb, that one's taken...	3
think of a user name instead. that's what people might end up calling you and you need one on github. damn that's even harder! screw the whole thing, i'd rather write more code."<p>i don't know whether i end up as the artist who's parents find a lot of paintings in the attic after his dead and finds universal praise, or the one who's work just end up in the trash can. but that whole attic thing will definitely happen. it sounds crazy in a way.<p>has anyone else had that problem, or still has? what to do?	2013-01-18 22:05:18 UTC		5	3

4864130	alternative bittorrent protocol	hi guys,<p>i have an idea for a new bittorrent-esque protocol that might have a chance of circumventing legal issues that commonly arise with file-sharing.<p>essentially, where bittorrent contains seeders and leechers, i would add another class called, i dunno, let's say "feeders," that act as a proxy between the other two. when a leecher requests a file from a known seeder, the data is first sent through a (random) feeder as a proxy, which records no data on either the file or the leecher. since, the feeder is not actually storing the file and doesn't record the leecher's ip, it shouldn't be illegal for the feeder to act as a proxy. as of now, i use btguard as a proxy for my bittorrent connections, which does essentially the same thing: proxies my bt data and keeps no records. this is how a "pirate" would be able to use btguard to anonymously share files.<p>one flaw in this scheme that may turn up is copyright-infringement scouts could act as a feeder, picking up ip addresses that turn up (only assuming they used a packet sniffer to detect ips, because the protocol itself would not do so), but this could potentially be fixed by using 2 feeders per seed, which further obfuscates the leecher.<p>the legal burden might then fall on seeder for having copyrighted material on the open web, but as i understand it now, currently the legal burden falls on the leechers when they download and are caught by ci-scouts, which is what i am trying to fix.<p>hopefully i'm not grasping at straws. i am really keen on starting this, assuming that such legal issues could be avoided. i am currently in my second semester of networking classes and i am confident that, given a certain amount of time, i could complete such a protocol.<p>before i look further into doing this, i wanted to run it by some other hackers, see what you guys think. any input would be appreciated.	2012-12-03 05:44:45 UTC		5	4
2450925	ask hn: how does one size a market?	i have always read that when validating a possible new venture one needs to know what the size of the market is for the product or service you will offer.<p>this seams like a simple task if you are opening a gas station in a neighborhood because you have easy access local demographic information but i have had difficulty coming up with realistic numbers for previous situations i have been in.<p>take this product for instance. "a centralized log monitoring tool for j2ee applications". one would have to know how many companies in a target region develop or run applications based on j2ee technology. i have to this date not been able to find an accurate number for that.<p>or another "a web based staff planning application for small businesses". in 2008, there were 29.6 million businesses in the united states but what percentage of those businesses would this product even apply to.<p>i am starting to think that the market analysis included in most business plans is somewhere between magic and pulled from thin air.<p>can anyone offer some resources to help me better understand how you can accurately size a market for a particular product or service.	2011-04-15 15:55:36 UTC		5	0

2755687	ask hn: i found my competition.  now what?	"the idea" hit me about 9 months ago.  in that time, i've been very busy with grad school so i haven't built much, though i did have a chance to experiment with a number of technologies and so i now have a pretty clear vision of how to build the site.<p>about a week ago, i discovered that 75% of my idea has been implemented by a site that's been around for almost 3 years.  last month they had 100k unique visitors and about 4x as many pageviews.   the missing 25% is, however, non-trivial.  i think the existing site is not as clean and clear as i would have liked.  there's less of a focus on media and more on text (my site would ideally have both).  the ads are somewhat annoying and not helpful (i have some good ideas for making money that is actually useful to my users).<p>on the other hand, my idea is very much dependent on a strong community so my competitor's existing userbase is a huge advantage.  now, my question is: how do i proceed?<p>as i see it, i have two options:	1
1. carry on.  slowly build the site, initially invite-only, and just bank on it being all around better.<p>2. contact my competitor (a very small team of two or three devs) and offer to join the team.<p>of course, if i contact them, they might choose to reject my offer so i have to be careful about what i say to them.  and if they accept-- what is a reasonable way for me to be compensated? i obviously want a piece of the pie here.<p>another thing that will have an impact on my decision is that i wasn't really looking to dominate the market with my site.  i would be happy to make a modest income while helping my users.  on the other hand, i don't know how happy i would be being in the backseat on the existing dev team vs. the driver on my own project.<p>i'm obviously not the first person in this situation.  does anyone have any advice or experience they are willing to share? thanks in advance.	2011-07-12 17:55:10 UTC		6	4

6648977	ask hn: how do you become a great hacker in today's world?	from what i read, it seems like 10-20 years ago, if you wanted to write some program, you had to do it (mostly) yourself. nowadays it seems like someone else has already written the code, and you&#x27;re just taking really big blocks of code and plugging them together. this is basically web development up to a point.<p>often i need to implement some new functionality and get excited about it, only to realize someone else already did it. i might have learned a lot writing it myself, but there&#x27;s already such a good implementation  out there--written by better programmers than me, well-tested, etc.-- that i can&#x27;t help but simply use it. rarely do i run into a problem so novel that, say, some jquery library or python module hasn&#x27;t already been written for it.<p>have the rules for hacking changed? how can i find hard problems to work on?	2013-10-31 18:54:44 UTC		9	2

165896	the (humorous) dangers of google's new deep search	i was reading the slashdot article on google's new "deep search" (http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/04/16/2052206.shtml) where it submits forms and sees what the results are. this is a quite insightful and interesting anecdote one user posted:<p>http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=525058&#38;cid=23096424<p><i>when i interned at google, someone told me a funny anecdote about a guy who emailed their tech support insisting that the google crawler had deleted his web site. at first, i think he was told that "just because we download a copy of your site, doesn't mean your local copy is gone." (a'la obligatory bash [bash.org].) but, the guy insisted, and finally they double checked and his site was in fact gone. turns out that it was a home-brewed wiki-style site, and each page had a "delete" button. the only problem was, the "delete" button sent its query via get, not post, and so the google spider happily followed those links one-by-one and deleted the poor guy's entire site. the google guys were feeling charitable and so they sent him a backup of his site, but told him he wouldn't be so lucky the next time, and he should change any forms that make changes to posts -- gets are only for queries.<p>so, long story short, i wonder how google will avoid more of this kind of problem if they're really going off the deep end and submitting random data on random forms on the web. like the above guy, people may not design their site with such a spider in mind, and despite their lack of foresight this could kill a lot of goodwill if done improperly.</i>	2008-04-17 02:12:19 UTC		22	2

488660	ask hn: hackers and founders in boston	hi everyone, i'm an amateur hacker and aspiring startup founder living and working in the boston area. i've been lurking at hn for about a year now and i really enjoy reading everyone's comments/discussions, etc. i've started getting into programming and such over the past year or so, learning mainly python/django, along with a bit of php and lisp (scheme) (i'm slowly working through sicp in my free time), so i'm always learning a thing or two from the discussions here!<p>i've recently decided to take the big jump and leave my corporate job soon to work on some ideas. the main one i've been working on for the past year is related to the music industry, but i'm still working on a few others concurrently.<p>since i'll have more "free" time on my hands in about a month, i would like to spend some of it meeting and interacting with some cool people. i was wondering if anyone knows of some good places in/around boston to meet fellow hackers/startup founders? i didn't go to school around here, so i'm kind of out of the loop (but would love to get back in it!) but i figured since some of you live here or are familiar with the area, you might know of some places to check out. i'm looking more toward informal environments (as opposed to pitch meetings, vc events, and the like, since i don't have an actual product built yet), though i'd give most events a shot anyway. also, i'm always looking to meet new people and try new things so if anyone would like to get together in person or otherwise to talk tech, startups, music, or basically anything else, definitely feel free to contact me (e-mail in profile).<p>thanks!	2009-02-20 13:51:06 UTC		23	4

1601808	ask hn: how can you measure your own mental performance?	my daughter was born in march and since then, in order to get close to the same amount done while also spending time with her, i'm sleeping a good couple of hours less per night than i used to (maybe 6 hours of broken sleep instead of 8 hours of good sleep).<p>there are a bunch of studies that show an impact of sleep on intelligence. now, while i generally feel like i'm coping well with the change, i occasionally do things that show i must be tired.<p>how would i know if it was making me more stupid? how can you assess changes in your own intelligence/smarts?<p>i used to feel that i really needed my sleep and i'm now trying to work out if fatherhood has taught me that i actually don't, or if i do but haven't noticed the impact on my mental abilities?	2010-08-13 18:38:53 UTC		35	2

2548621	hn: i want to trade my finance knowledge for python/django mentorship	i wanted to see if someone on hn is willing to mentor me through learning python and django. below are some details on my current skill level, what i’m looking for, and what i can offer. i’m located in san francisco.<p>i know what i'm offering is limited in value relative to what you are offering me, so i am open to give you anything else i could reasonably offer for this mentorship.<p>current skill level:	0
i know the basics of python and have gone through “how to think like a computer scientist” and written some small scripts. i understand how django works and have been through some simple tutorials.<p>what i’m looking for:	2
i’m looking for someone who could efficiently guide me through learning, i.e. what tutorials/projects/resources i should go through. more a mentor than a tutor. maybe we’d meet once a week to code small samples. i would email you for help if i got stuck.<p>i do already spend time self-teaching, but i think i could learn much more efficiently through someone else’s guidance. i think this, because i have self-learned a lot of things and have found with a little guidance, things go substantially quicker.<p>what i can offer:	1
i can teach/guide you through learning:<p>- account fundamentals (understanding the 3 financial statements and how they flow together; balance sheet, cash flows and income statement)<p>- interest theory, fixed income/debt/bond valuation<p>- m&#38;a analysis and valuation (discounted cash flow, comparables/multiples, accretion/dilution)<p>- options/futures fundamentals (i think there is potentially an opportunity for adept programmers here to apply their skills).<p>- bankruptcy/distressed corporate situations<p>- crash course on how to dig through and interpret sec filings (the only reliable free primary data source if you want to invest in public markets)<p>why would you need these skills? i think they are crucial if you are:<p>1) an entrepreneur who will ever raise capital or sell your company<p>2) someone interested in learning how to invest in the public or private markets – this knowledge will serve as a solid foundation/prerequisite<p>3) someone in optimizing the financial efficiency of their business<p>i’d like to think i am at least acceptably good at teaching. i used to tutor economics, accounting, sat prep, etc. and have received good feedback.<p>credentials:	3
i’ve worked as an m&#38;a/restructuring analyst at a reputable investment bank and have had offers from well-known financial institutions/hedge funds. i’ve also had the fortune to have some excellent mentors in my past. i can provide more details if you want over email.<p>my email is in my profile, i look forward to hearing from you.<p>addition: email added to profile.	2011-05-14 21:40:11 UTC		78	2

9037955	reality or glassdoor and similar stats	within the last year i&#x27;ve been approached by a couple of startups who have technical founders focused on the secret sauce&#x2f;core business.  i was approached in both cases as a possible cto where the bulk of the work was building out the cloud infrastructure tailored to the needs of the crown jewels.  based on my background, there were also likely contributions to the &quot;crown jewels&quot; as well.  clearly the algorithm guy was setting himself up as cso, another technical founder had ceo, the services side was expected to be the job of the cto.<p>in both cases the companies were seed stage, maybe been through an accelerator or not.  i was honored to be approached, but as an industry veteran, taking a 50% pay cut for 3-5% equity seemed a bit much.<p>to generalize, seed, focused on building out infrastructure &#x2f; customer base -- salary 100-140k, 3-5% equity.<p>my sniffer says this is &quot;reasonable&quot; but looking at and knowing the work needed, a pay cut plus the percentage to basically build a cloud service seemed underwhelming.<p>i assume the offers were reasonable, or was i not over anali tidal?	2015-02-12 08:23:00 UTC		1	3

9316323	ask hn: how to review github pr with multiple authors?	github&#x27;s pull request and commenting on code commits and pull requests is amazing. but when reviewing pull requests where multiple persons have contributed code to the same pr, it becomes quite complicated to map code in pr to the commit or the original author.<p>say a did a commit `aaa` and b did a commit `bbb`, and there is a pull request with these 2 commits, and i comment on the pull&#x2f;1&#x2f;files, it doesn&#x27;t link to either `aaa` or `bbb` nor its original authors. is there anyway to do this without manually finding each of the author informing each of the author that your code requires improvement.<p>i&#x27;m trying to do something like git-blame on prs or link line numbers to commit hashes. github doesn&#x27;t support this feature. is there any workaround to do this, or if not for pr, is there anything else that i can use to do this ?	2015-04-03 15:15:18 UTC		1	0

i am trying to apply what ive learnt to a simple dummy page with ror and pgsql.<p>im wondering if its possible to build something that looks similar to google spreadsheet on a input page (i.e i can input from a web browser) which translates to a output page as compact lines or grids?<p>the input and output page formats are limited (i think from css boostrap), ie. they appear as single line forms which cant be inputted on a side by side basis (i.e i have to input based on text boxes for all of one column, say all countries first, then the next.) can&#x27;t we do it both vertically and horizontally together? (reason being its easier to input and check for the accuracy of the information).<p>also good to have a auto calculation such as total population etc which refreshes.<p>so something like for example:<p>country  city  population(mm)  weather   remarks  +add more categories	1
us     nyc        8.4        stormy      nil	0

4300745	ask hn: architecture vs. performance?	hi,<p>as working on an interesting project, i face a recurring problem which i still struggle on at programming.<p>the problem i work on is simply an image parsing (language independed). i know _a_ solution of this problem, i've done it before, but i still have the feeling about, how can i solve this better.<p>the structure of this problem is:	2
- load the image (say bmp)	2
- search the image for certain byte pattern	1
- create a list of this pattern and search for nearby patterns	3
- save the results as new list of structures<p>so the schoolbook solution would be doing all this step by step. this would also allow to cleanly separate each steps in a certain architecture which would allow some kind of modify-less reuse.<p>but i also have some solutions in mind, which merges some of these steps to reduce the memory consumption and reduce the iterations done on the data, but then they result in a structure oriented architecture which results in the need of review, rewrite when reusing it. the architecture would finally be a monolithic "x to y converter" architecture.<p>i know its the all time weighting which is to be decided by creating such an algorithm, but maybe you know some more variants which is not just black and white and takes profit from both views.<p>thanks.	2012-07-27 10:01:39 UTC		1	3

1744490	ask hn: how can i build web apps without knowing how to code them?	does anyone know of a resource which allows a person to build web apps without knowing how to code them? like google's app inventor allows people to build (somewhat basic) android apps with knowing the code, i'd like to find something i can use to build a web app i would like to have for my personal use.<p>it would be great if it was wysiwyg or close to that.<p>i assume it may be somewhat limited, that's fine.<p>it would be great if i could edit the output with my own code down the line when i learn how to do so.<p>hiring someone to do this for me would defeat the purpose. half the reason i want this is to have something to play with and experiment with.<p>i have been learning to code on the side. i'd like to learn how to build web apps and am learning how to make android apps. it is going to take a while and i am fine with that. however i am impatient and would like to find something that allows me to take a bit of a short cut in a way and allow me to play with web app creation in a basic way while i simultaneously learn how to do it the right way.<p>thanks!	2010-09-30 19:28:17 UTC		1	0

184748	how to prevent duplicate submissions-- a standard way to specify url equivalency?	nytimes urls got me again this morning-- didn't mean to submit a dupe, and hn's dupe catcher didn't catch it.<p>what if in robots.txt, there was a way to specify which query parameters in a url are unique to the content?<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>  uniquecontenturlparameters: "articleid","node"	2
</code></pre>	3
would mean that dupe checkers would know to ignore those parameters that don't match any of the items in the list.<p><pre><code>  http://news.ycombinator.com/robots.txt:	1
uniquecontenturlparameters: "id"	2
	2
http://nytimes.com/robots.txt:	4
uniquecontenturlparameters: none	0
</code></pre>	0
of course, this doesn't solve the problem of bad url design, such as the bbc news site, where you have<p><pre><code>  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7391008.stm	0
</code></pre>	1
and<p><pre><code>  http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7391008.stm	1
</code></pre>	4

9113155	ask hn: how can i determine who is using a given public ip address without dpi?	sounds like a dumb question but hear me out: i&#x27;d like to determine who the service provider is for a given public ip address. i&#x27;m not talking about who <i>owns</i> it–that information is readily available–but instead who is actually <i>using</i> it.<p>let&#x27;s take netflix for example: if i see a stream of packets to a netflix server and look up the owner of that destination ip i will invariably get amazon because netflix (like many service providers) run on amazon.<p>how could i identify that it is netflix who is providing the service without doing dpi on the tls handshake? (you can guess at it from the raw data stream because the server&#x27;s hostname will be in plain text)	2015-02-26 15:58:18 UTC		3	0

2806537	ask hn: learning http - writing a web server in which language?	i've been on a hiatus to study and prepare for web development jobs since i've decided to switch half an year ago. i have appr. 8 years of prior programming experience with mainly c/c++ doing cad-related and video games programming.<p>in the past 6 months, i've read numerous books and wrote i would say a lot of toy-ish and not so toy-ish code using plain vanilla php, smarty templates, zend frameworks apps, wordpress plugins, that sort of things. recently, i've started implementing some mini projects using twitter api and the real-time protocols over http (sup, pubsubhubbub) and i felt the need to know http a lot more. so, after a little research i found (maybe) the perfect book: "illustrated guide to http" by paul hethmon. it's about learning the details of http by writing a minimalistic web server in c.<p>since i don't program in c anymore and thought that i will not benefit fully if i wrote the server by the book in a language that i'm quite familiar, i was wondering which programming language to choose to implement the server in?	0
i think in my position it boils down to:<p>* php: i'm comfortable programming in it, it can expand my knowledge by the usage of the standard libraries.<p>* server-side javascript using node.js: i think i can comfortable write server-like code in js, but i only know about node.js for instance, not programmed in it. i guess it will not be too hard with the node.js/js code-test-debug cycle on windows, will it?<p>thanks	2011-07-26 08:38:14 UTC		3	1

1600781	ask hn: i am stuck between a rock & a hard place. what's next?	i am in the process of creating a web based service for small businesses. so, i went out and got feedback from as diverse a group of people i could find within my immediate environment (i live in india).<p>the feedback i got was troubling to say the least. the thing is that although after an extended conversation and repeated cold calling people understood and appreciated what i was trying to offer. they're still refusing to use it in a small private alpha. why?<p>the thing is that i am asking them to store their financial records with me and, although privacy is not an issue, they are worried about tax. in fact, they have an elaborate culture in place to tackle just this. this ranges from bribes, destruction of all financial records at the end of the fiscal year to purposeful inventory mismanagement to throw off the sales data. for example, if they got ten boxes of something they'll put in 5 and keep the rest black.<p>since, the paper trail is huge and the honest tax authorities like to trap big-wigs. they get away with it. so, if they opt into my service in the longer run the noose tightens on them. the obvious way out would be to encrypt the database and allow for regular erasures, but that undermines the core benefits of my service.<p>moreover, i intend to stick around for a while. so, it's pretty inevitable that i'll have a messy legal situation on my hands down the road. the precedent has already been set and it's disturbing to say the least (see: http://knol.google.com/k/david-sarokin/google-ordered-to-reveal-blogger/l9cm7v116zcn/7# ).<p>it also doesn't help my cause that i am still a teenager. it's quite obvious to everyone that i cannot <i>possibly</i> know what i am talking about. it's a trivial issue, but it's amazing how such things tend to bias conversations.<p>so, any tips on what i should do?<p>thank you.	2010-08-13 13:03:01 UTC		3	4

6742723	ask hn: is there a phrase for this kind of development	hi.<p>i am doing front end javascript work that uses ajax calls as a means to send objects to php where they are decoded&#x2f;encoded and stored in mysql. the same pattern is used to retrieve them. i don&#x27;t use php for anything else other than as a &#x27;mailman&#x27; to store data in mysql. i write the front and back end (php).<p>i am curious if their is a common phrase used to describe this form of development.<p>ok.that is all.	2013-11-15 23:04:41 UTC		6	2

131532	ask yc: money, power, freedom, and open source.	i've always thought it would be cool to put my code online for others to mess with.  but every time i think about it, i end up being inhibited by the question 'what if i want to make money off of this?' or i think 'by releasing this, i'll be wasting my competitive advantage.'  then i get all conflicted thinking big general thoughts about capitalism vs. er... anti-capitalism (socialism? idealism? whatever you call it).<p>i'm currently 23 and being supported by my parents, which is nice because it offers me freedom, but lame for obvious reasons.  what i really want is the freedom to work on my ideas and the power to make them real.  i don't care much about money and am not very interested in going the vc -&#62; ipo route, but i also realize that turning big ideas into reality may take a lot of money.  so part of this is me figuring out what trajectory to set my life on.  i guess i'll probably end up doing some combination of open / closed stuff, but i'm having trouble deciding where to draw the line.<p>i guess this is just the classic tension between open source vs. closed source playing out in my head.  stallman vs. gates.  i'm curious to see what ycers think of the issue.	2008-03-07 21:37:35 UTC		6	4

7671981	ask hn: do you start with a visual prototype or backend code?	i&#x27;ve started working on a project from a visual prototype before i get into the backend code. i wanted to find out what approaches others use.<p>i find it easier to understand how to hook up the backend code, once i know how the product should work visually.	2014-04-30 07:12:43 UTC		6	2
767175	can i get some advice	i have a fairly successful website that generates about $3k per month in profit, with solid growth in the recent past and easy continued growth in the near future. the only reason why that 3k is not 30k, or 75k per month is because of my laziness.<p>i have a list of 50+ things that need to be done with the site, changes, additions, writing etc... and i just can't seem to focus on getting them done.<p>i have people contact me to advertise all the time and i just tell them we are not accepting new advertisers right now, because i am too lazy to deal with yet another contact, and going back and forth with my tech people to get the ads implemented.<p>i have absolutely no technical skills and i outsource all of the work on the tech side overseas. the trouble is that i hate being a project manager and walking people through my vision.also, good help is hard to find.<p>i also have a well-paying full time job and a growing family and i cannot devote myself to the site wholeheartedly until the revenue allows me to quit my job.<p>some of my options as i currently see them are:<p>1. sell the site. i have been approached several times by very good and well known acquirers about selling to them. i said no because i know there is so much revenue to be unlocked with a little bit of work that i just can't let it go at a much lower valuation.<p>2. i could just continue along as i have been, making minor improvements very slowly and just leave some money on the table.<p>3. i could look for a partner to help actualize my vision and unlock the potential.<p>any thoughts or suggestions are greatly appreciated.	2009-08-17 01:52:59 UTC		6	1
8196835	ask hn: would you walk away from this?	i have been asked to consult a company in how they should speed up their development process.<p>today the application which in the end of it all is a web application, consists of a lot of old asp classic code, a com+ bridge for being able to function within a mix of a lot of different .net libraries written in .net 3.5 (clr 2). com+ acts as a bridge between the two technologies.<p>the teams cannot compile code inside the development tools, it can&#x27;t debug unless they do it with some obscure hacks and workarounds and it seems that no one is really in control of what is going on in the core code base and no one really want to touch the original code base to clean it up and refactor&#x2f;re-write it.<p>my concerns are really rooted in different aspects of the project.<p>the project has been like this for multiple years, i mean, the asp code base is around 10-13 years old. there is nothing wrong with old technology i think but building on top of it for over 10 years was probably not a great idea.<p>then someone has tried to build a gap between asp and asp.net and i assume this is because of business-needs and also no one really wanting to get their hands dirty with a refactoring.<p>why would a business do this ? keep patching and re-patching old code instead of cleaning up and making things smoother and safer.<p>not to talk about the effeciency of developers and teams.<p>i am frustrated, only 3 weeks in, and i am obviously not the only on whom has tried to figure this out, but everyone has just given up and said &quot;this is just how it is.&quot;.<p>given those facts, would you engage or walk away ?<p>i just don&#x27;t like to walk away, but this is basically a big mess which in turn runs a multi million dollars business.	2014-08-19 11:49:16 UTC		6	1

4493601	ask hn: would an overview of state of the world help you make decisions?	hi hn,<p>i'm building a website[1] that will basically sum up all the most	4
important information about current world problems and display it as	0
an explorable overview (think command and control centers from sci-fi	1
/ computer games and sci-fi movies, google earth, or something similar	1
to fate of the world[2]). the idea is for following questions to be	4
answered by just taking a glance and/or exploring the site for few	1
seconds.<p>- what needs to be fixed? what's the progress?<p>especially <i>how many</i> things are broken - do we have ten big problems	2
problem, or ten dozens of them? and then not just a list of problems,	2
but a) how close are we to effectively solving given problem, and b)	2
1'st derivative - is it getting better or worse, and how fast?<p>- who's fixing it?<p>what solutions are targeting those problems? which ngo's are working	1
on them? just a curated list (think givewell) and contact info for	2
those, who would like to join the efforts.<p>- how can you help?<p>what skills are needed where - for those who want to steer their	1
development into the area. who's fixing it - for those who want to	1
help organizations.<p>do you, as hackers and/or enterpreneurs, think such tool could be	4
useful in making decisions about what to build, who to help, or just	2
to have a better understanding of the world?<p>[1] - a brief description is posted right now on	3

9865849	ask hn: why do tech interview recruiters not reject me	let me explain. i have been interviewing actively with tech companies and startups recently having already done about 15 interviews with different companies and into multiple rounds. i go through the phone screening, technical round and then meeting them on site. so far so good. sometimes i know that the interview did not go well but sometimes i feel that it was really good. but after this starts my biggest headache.<p>they stop communicating totally as if the company doesnt even exist. they dont send any emails accepting or rejecting me (has been weeks). this has happened with 4 companies so far and i am fed up of sending email asking them again (mind you these are big named ones trending here often).<p>i dont mind being rejected. but to leave me &#x27;hoping&#x27; is the biggest problem i have with them. i understand that you dont want a bad hire but atleast saying that you are not a fit right now is what i am expecting.<p>i also find this to be a bigger problem in the us than in some other countries i have worked.	2015-07-10 18:35:13 UTC		8	1

3240007	3d printers can now read ct scans and produce bone models	thanks to surgeon mark frame, 3d printers can now read ct scans and produce bone models at a fraction of the previous cost. to accomplish this he used osirix, an image processing package specific for the kinds produced by imaging equipment, such as ct scanners. as osirix is open source software that runs on mac os, frame was able to use it free of charge. he then used a program called meshlab – also open source, and free, for mac – to clean up the image and make them medical quality. finally, this image was sent for printing. seven days later the model bone arrived in the mail. all for £77.<p>frame and colleagues have started a company that makes the models for you. just send 3d-om your ct scan and they’ll send you back your model. heck, it’s so cheap now, if you’ve got a ct scan you might just want to get the model for fun.	2011-11-15 20:23:31 UTC	http://singularityhub.com/2011/11/15/surgeon-uses-3d-printer-to-make-models-of-bone-%e2%80%93-and-saves-hospital-bookoo-bucks/	56	1

5769665	how to burn $20 on twitter with $10 real cpc	i heard twitter advertising was pretty good, so i decided to give it a shot.<p>why i try new advertising channels, i typically spend $20 to be fair.<p>i also run a personal link shorten-er, and decided to use that to track my ctr.<p>in about 30 minutes 20$ bought me 31 engagements (all clicks in this case) on a promoted tweet.<p>at ~$0.65 ecpe, this sounds like an awesome deal. obviously the quality of the traffic won't be as good as search traffic.<p>however, i made sure my ad was at least geographically targeted.<p>reality:<p>of the 31 reported engagements, my link shorten-er showed 10 clicks.<p>2 were from self proclaimed bots (mozilla/5.0 (compatible; tweetmemebot/3.0; +http://tweetmeme.com/))<p>6 others were also from bots, they had these user agents:<p>ruby<p>kimengi/nineconnections.com<p>metauri api/2.0 +metauri.com<p>js-kit url resolver, http://js-kit.com/<p>(twice) unwindfetchor/1.0 (+http://www.gnip.com/)<p>at the end of the day, only two other clicks came from realistic useragent/ips that could be construed as a real person.<p>real cost:<p>$10 cpc<p>conclusion:<p>totally not worth it. twitter needs to get their shit straight and resolve their blatant click fraud or provide the real data behind those engagements (useragents, precise ip based geolocation, referrers.)	2013-05-26 01:34:50 UTC		61	1

2374214	cufp 2011 (tokyo, japan) call for presentations	commercial users of functional programming workshop (cufp) 2011	0
call for presentations<p>sponsored by sigplan	4
co-located with icfp 2011<p>tokyo, japan	4
sep 22-24<p>proposal submission deadline 15 june 2011<p>functional programming languages have been a hot topic of academic	2
research for over 35 years, and they have seen an ever larger practical	0
impact in settings ranging from tech startups to financial firms to	3
biomedical research labs. at the same time, a vigorous community of	1
programmers employing functional languages has come into existence.<p>cufp is designed to serve this community. the annual cufp workshop is a	2
place where people can see how others are using functional programming	0
to solve real world problems; where practitioners meet and collaborate;	3
where language designers and users can share ideas about the future of	4
their favorite language; and where one can learn practical techniques	1
and approaches for putting functional programming to work.<p># giving a cufp talk<p>if you have experience using functional languages in a practical setting,	1
we invite you to submit a proposal to give a talk at the workshop. we're	1
looking for two kinds of talks:<p><i>experience reports</i> are typically 25 minutes long, and aim to inform	0
participants about how functional programming plays out in real-world	2
applications, focusing especially on lessons learned and insights	3
gained. experience reports don't need to be highly technical; reflections	1
on the commercial, management, or software engineering aspects are,	1
if anything, more important.<p><i>technical talks</i> are also 25 minutes long, and should focus on teaching the	1
audience something about a particular technique or methodology, from the	0
point of view of someone who has seen it play out in practice. these talks	2
could cover anything from techniques for building functional concurrent	0
applications, to managing dynamic reconfigurations, to design recipes for	0
using types effectively in large-scale applications. while these talks	4
will often be based on a particular language, they should be accessible	1
to a broad range of programmers.<p>if you are interested in offering a talk, or nominating someone	0
to do so, send an e-mail to avsm2(at)cl(dot)cam(dot)ac(dot)uk or	2
yminsky(at)janestreet(dot)com by 15 june 2011 with a short description	1
of what you'd like to talk about or what you think your nominee should	4
give a talk about. such descriptions should be about one page long.<p>there will be a short scribes report of the presentations and discussions	1
but not of the details of individual talks, as the meeting is intended	2
to be more a discussion forum than a technical interchange. you do not	0
need to submit a paper, just a proposal for your talk!<p># program committee<p>* anil madhavapeddy (university of cambridge)	2

1050706	ask hn: review my startup, webservius	see http://www.webservius.com<p>i'm currently positioning it as an api management product (and it certainly does that), but think about it from a different perspective: it allows you to monetize any useful software component as an api in the cloud. for example.: suppose you came up with an interesting image processing algorithm - you just host it somewhere as an api, hook it up to webservius, set the pricing through our control panel (e.g. $0.01 per image), and you instantly have a potential revenue stream - no need to worry about user signup process, billing, etc. that's why i thought it would be interesting to the hn community - people with lots of great ideas looking for ways to monetize :) any feedback would be much appreciated.<p>thanks,<p>-- eugene	2010-01-13 18:21:32 UTC		19	2

1917999	ask hn: help me chose a name for my business	i've asked this already..but i usually make these in the middle of the night due to the timezones so it gets buried.<p>i'm starting a small business/ the business is mainly an automotive parts distributor to mechanics, not regular retail people. i'm selling fluids, oil, and things like that.think less actual physical automotive "hardware" and more of stuff like oil filters and sparkplugs and brake fluids.<p>what are things i should consider when creating a small business? it's a huge project and i'm starting very very small. i pretty much just sell stuff to mechanics, i will try to increase revenue if i'm successful with making connections.<p>can you recommend me a name for my business? i'm thinking something like, _____ auto supplies but i have no idea what to name it. all the names i've come up with are generic.<p>any other tips would be highly appreciated, thanks hn!	2010-11-18 15:19:32 UTC		2	4

2754579	ask hn: niche app customer acquisition?	i recently launched a new service for monitoring ssl certificates [1], and i'm trying to figure out how to find customers.<p>i built this service because of a need i had, one that i thought others would have as well.<p>my service does couple of simple, useful things: lets you know if your certs are going to expire and lets you know if your certs are misconfigured or not working.<p>i initially saw the value in this type of service as being a simple way for people to set up reminders about when their certificates are going to expire. (no more need to worry about who the ca is emailing)<p>but now i think there may be more value in the validation piece.<p>basically, i'm having a hard time figuring out how to target customers that would find my service useful.<p>i have a couple of targeted adwords ads running right now and i have a reddit ad scheduled for later this week.<p>i've had some thought of writing an app that looks for expired ssl certs on the web and emails the domain owners, but this seems too spammy (maybe even illegal). i also thought about approaching a smaller registrar for a partnership, but i don't think any will go for working with such a new startup.<p>does anyone have any tips for acquiring customers for a niche product?<p>bcc comes to mind, and maybe my type of service is similar in that i'll just have to wait until people with a need start looking for a solution, but i'd love to take a more active approach to customer acquisition, if possible.<p>[1] https://www.certician.com/	2011-07-12 13:13:09 UTC		1	3

4830810	ask hn: how do i get a job at the lhc?	hacker news is filled with a wide variety of people, so i am hoping someone on here might be able to help me out with regards to what the best route is for working at the large hadron collider.<p>i am a chemical engineering graduate student in the first year of my doctoral program.  i've already done research in molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the supercomputers at a national lab in the us.  i realize this is somewhat different than the work that most people do at the lhc, but there's always interesting niches that need to be filled.<p>my interests are more in the theoretical, physics-based side of chemical engineering instead of the engineering aspects, so a research career would be my best hope.<p>i will pursue the conventional means of trying to get a job at cern, but as it seems like an incredibly exciting and unusual place, i am hoping that some folks on here may have some insight into a good route to get there.  thanks!	2012-11-26 05:59:55 UTC		2	2

1751651	ask hn: how do you manage trigger-happy installing and file-bloat 	this is probably a newbie question. i'm using a mac, and getting into development, you tend to install a lot of stuff.<p>while there are some nice package managers out there, their scope is limited, and since when is hacking a =). hence, i'm pretty sure my trigger-happy installing and trying to stay up to date with the latest versions of everything has left my root directory littered with now useless stuff.<p>from now on, i guess i'll be more selective with what i install, but the problem still needs to be fixed.<p>because i'm not a unix-wiz, and the fact that so many shell scripts share the same name. eg: i've got a node script in /usr/local/bin corresponding to v0.2.0, and another corresponding to v0.2.3 in another dir, but i'm hesitant to move things around or delete things, in fear that something may break.<p>i probably need to get a much better familiarity with the file system. basically, things like bash paths and all the stuff that goes on when you call "make install" . as such, what resources would be good?<p>thanks.	2010-10-02 23:41:55 UTC		2	0

- 2nd one is 5kb and minified	3
- 3rd one is 33kb and minified<p>should i just include them in the index page (32kb non-minified) internally so that there are less server requests? i'm just getting into javascript and am a complete noob when it comes to these things. i know it's best to keep javascript external so it can be cached and used on other pages, but this is a one page site. it will never expand past one page.	2012-04-25 02:48:46 UTC		1	4

3479753	ask hn: thoughts on anonymous identity provider idea	one of the big problems with online anonymous identity is that you have no way of evaluating trustworthiness of an anonymous person. i have this idea for a service which can solve this.<p>basically, if there existed an open id provider site which:<p>- allows you to generate an anonymous identity with a single click for each online service when they ask you to authorize, or use an existing one<p>- has an api allowing sites using this authorisation mechanism to discover certain data about you without compromising your identity, e.g. has a valid facebook identity, has verified a phone number/credit card, is actually a software engineer looking for a job etc.<p>this would allow you do do things like establish trust (like on airbnb), block spammers but allow anon comments, etc.<p>- would you use such a service as a user?<p>- would you use such a service as an auth mechanism for your site?<p>- how would you get traction for this idea?<p>- how would you build a business around this?<p>- have any other thoughts?<p>cheers!	2012-01-18 14:20:07 UTC		9	2

765063	ask hn: hardware business; preventing a competitor from using your driver	i want to start a company selling a piece of hardware i designed. the hardware needs a driver, and i'd like to give people who buy my thing the source code to the driver to let them modify stuff if they want to. the problem is that i'd be a small business, and as i see it, if i open source the driver to my product there's nothing preventing a larger electronics manufacturing company from building and selling something that uses the driver i wrote. so, to protect myself from that contingency, (obviously) i'd include something preventing the sale of hardware that uses that driver in the license to the code. so, i've got two questions:<p>1. legalese; anybody law-knowledgeable here who can say how much protection provisions in the license to the code of the driver would offer?<p>2. partial-drm solution: to reiterate, i'd really like to give customers the code, but i don't want to inadvertently help a competitor undercut me, anybody heard of a partially-proprietary driver created by a hardware company to solve the problem i'm describing?<p>obviously, i don't mean to claim ownership to ideas, only their implementation; but if my thing gets popular i'd prefer it if the company that eventually undercuts me has to through the expense of designing their own stuff.	2009-08-15 19:05:07 UTC		2	3

515876	ask hn: please review twollars	dear hn members,<p>i've been here on hn for almost a year now and time and time again i see the most valuable comments come by on ask hn review posts. to be honest, they are by far my favorites.<p>i am very happy to now be posting my own. last month my co-founder and i launched twollars. twollars is a twitter thank you currency. simply by tweeting "give 5 twollars @username" - there is no registration - you can send twollars to someone. (you can also use any of the other commands - here is a list on our wiki with all the commands we are experimenting with: http://thinktank.twollars.com/wiki/71163)<p>where we hope to do a lot of good is by allowing people to donate their twollars to a charity. the charity in turn is sponsored by a company who pledges to donate the real amount in hard currency.<p>we are also very close to launching multi-currencies. which will allow anyone on twitter to start their own currency. the thoughts behind this are to allow people to setup their own community currency (similar to many open money concepts that are being tried).<p>url: http://twollars.com<p>any feedback is really appreciated!<p>thank you so much,<p>eiso &#38; mac	2009-03-14 14:53:53 UTC		21	1
