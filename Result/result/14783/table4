4229962 ask hn: tracking hours for 20+ person web agency? few months ago i have stumble upon on software for running web agency business. it is some kind of tracking hours and project managament tools, but made especially for web agencies with 20 persons or more.<p>because 'project managament' is really crowded on google i cannot find them anymore. i didn't bookmarked and i didn't remember the name. i think the founder is some 20-something years old guy with russian origins, could be alexey or sergey or similar name.<p>help from all pm people that are tracking new software would be appreciated. software is i think from 2012 and fairly new.<p>their website is similar to letsfreckle.com and i even think i am on good place, but freckle is optimized as almost all other pm tools for 1-5 person agenices.<p>this software done by russian/ukraine guys was optimized for my kind of business, 20+ persons agency.<p>it has those features:
- time tracking (with non billable hours)
- invoicing
- estimates i think also<p>it is saas application.
i think it has blog where founder told it's build by web design studio to web design studios [or similar]<p>it's not: freshbooks, harvest, paymo, ronin, billingapp, fanurio, ronin, etc.<p>hn is the last place i think i could get the right link. thank you a lot! 2012-07-11 16:37:18 UTC

8429016 ask hn: trademarking advice. do you do it for your startups? hi there hackers!<p>i wanted to get some advice on trademarks. as a startup, you&#x27;re always out to prove your concept by building your mvp on a random but available domain. my question is this, did you all register your trademarks?<p>reason i am asking is that i&#x27;ve not thought about it yet although hear that its very important. something i&#x27;d like to know is what is the best practise advice for doing it? also if you build a website with global reach (pretty much all of them are these days), would you have to register it globally? would a local approach work first as you grow or is that advised against? 2014-10-08 19:40:55 UTC

1558923 the next social winter  there was an ai winter, then a financial winter. next one will be an educational and social winter.  what is the core of the problem? the answer lies in great false expectations and removing regulations.    how to avoid this? i think the solution lies in understanding layers of complexity.<p>education is the next big topic, if we are not able to understand the complexity involved in education we are going to fail miserable and this could be the first step in the social winter forecast.  i could construct and de-construct history and education, but we really need to understand the complexity involved and never accept a single test to measure what is non easily mensurable. there is no clear scale for intelligence, a 1$ calculator can beat any man in computations, so don't think education is easy to measure. our education is shaped by our expectations, but false expectations and measures can ruin education and open the door to the social fall. 2010-07-29 19:33:29 UTC

6601100 ask hn: linkedin profile as a doc or pdf? recently, i came across a discussion with a recruiter wanting to have his job candidates linkedin profiles as document or pdf rather than sharing them as link. i know we could download our profile as pdf in linkedin, but for recruiters they usually screen hundreds of profiles a day.<p>is this a nice thing to have this tool developed and have some business model around on this? basically i want to validate this as idea if its feasible to invest sometime on development or not?
or we have something like this already on the market? provide your comment or suggestions and i am open to others related on this as well. thanks in advance. 2013-10-23 19:30:47 UTC

4034035 how not to build long-term brand equity. &#60;soapbox&#62;
most who read this will likely not "get" the gist of this post. that is, until three (3) os versions from now when apple decides your meager 64-bit hardware unworthy of their latest 128-bit feline-named release.<p>trying to update my wife's circa 2005 aluminum 15" macbook pro, it appears that the app store does not know that there are core duo (not core2duo) machines that can still run snow leopard, but are 32-bit.<p>many of the apps that she had purchased before cannot be updated until she spends another $2500 for hardware with a 2 or an "i" in the cpu name.<p>imagine if microsoft had done this, forcing hundreds of millions of users to upgrade their hardware to use a senselessly 64-bit-only note taking application. they'd be out of business or at least in much worse shape than they are now...<p>yeah, it's me, again griping about how apple has disenfranchised me yet again, blah, blah, blah.<p>seriously, though. imagine if your car company wouldn't work on your car, even under warranty, because your engine was "old architecture". why does apple get away with this and nobody else does? this hardware is perfectly good, and it would take all of 12 seconds for developers to provide 32-bit versions of their apps for "legacy" users.<p>i'm writing this more to open a discussion about why windows and linux users <i>never</i> see this sort of "architecturism", to coin a word if i might, and yet we blindly accept it from apple.<p>three grand in cash out the window on this apple laptop that works perfectly well, just because some bonehead at apple decided it wasn't worth supporting.<p>sheesh...
&#60;/soapbox&#62;<p>ok.. all done whining now.  i know it' my fault, but it's so purdy...  waaaaiiiitt... linux mint 13 with kde is out???? wha????? 2012-05-28 16:37:12 UTC

9688839 ask hn: advice for my phone project few months ago i tried to build a phone platform where shy people could phone call and talk to members of the opposite sex to get more comfortable in conversation.  ideally, a person would set an amount from free to x money per minute.  shy person would call anonymous phone number and be prompted for credit card.  after payment it would call provider cell phone so user does not have their phone #.  after end of conversation, system automatically tallies bill and gives pittance to me and most money to provider.  at that time also, user is prompted to buy emailed mp3 recording of conversation for x money and provider gets most of that money too.<p>i am very novice and do not have heavy coding experience.  worked a little bit with visual basic, html, wordpress, drupal, &amp; php.  tried using twilio twimlets, but couldn&#x27;t get exact functionality i wanted.  another user on here recommended i use stripe for payment processing, but couldn&#x27;t find a novice function akin to strimlets.  lastly tried using zapier and then i gave up.<p>wanting to try again.  are there any more easy-to-use resources hn could recommend for this project?  if anyone knows of an open-source downloadable platform that is similar, maybe i could manipulate that.  appreciate your time and advice! 2015-06-09 22:10:10 UTC

1052708 ask hn: how to move to the usa and find cofounders hi all, i live in a city that is far from being the startup hub, what is even worse, is the fact that it is really far from being in usa as well. on the other hand, i live with startup ideas in my mind, (started one and failed, started the next one. ). so i definitely need to move closer to the place where the air is full of new ideas, ventures and what is more important, the place where i can find people that are eager to take a risk, are willing to innovate and work really hard. have anyone succeeded to do that? i appreciate if you folks share your personal experience, success and failure stories. 2010-01-14 15:01:08 UTC

3324012 ask hn: job is miserable; go out on my own? apologies in advance for the length of this.<p>i'd spent the previous 12 years in it, starting out as a programmer and making my way up the management chain until i was cio for a smaller it services company.  it was a great opportunity, but i was commuting 3+ hours per day and working 100+ hour weeks...needless to say it took it's toll on me and would have on my family had i stayed put.  i'd always had the entrepreneurial bug, but never acted on it until i realized it was time to finally make the leap.  so i made what i consider(ed) a strategic move in the summer of 2010 and left to join a government agency that is 20 minutes from my house.  in doing so i knew i'd have a better work life balance, which would allow me to pursue my goal of building a software company and working for myself (hopefully by the summer of 2012).<p>initially i got exactly what i could have wanted...i was fortunate to land a good position in the cio's office, which also got me back into the development game, but not even a year in, they dissolved the cio and moved us all around to other divisions.  since july i've maybe performed 3 hours of what could be considered work...there just is nothing for me to do, nor anything of interest in my current office.  to make matters worse, due to budget cuts/hiring freezes, you can't move around to other groups so you are stuck. everyone i work with is in a similar boat which makes for a miserable work environment (think joe vs. the volcano)<p>while some people may consider getting paid just for showing up a dream job, especially given the current economy...i've never been one to sit back and collect a paycheck, i like to earn my keep.<p>and while i now essentially have 8 hours/day (paid) to work on my own company, being in such a boring, depressed environment has sapped most of my energy.  i had no desire to get out of bed in the morning, nor sit here for hours on end. all of this is starting to adversly affect my side company work.<p>if i didn't have a family and bills to pay, i'd quit and focus fulltime on my side company, so i've been casually exploring other options to help me get through this.<p>i've had inquiries from other govt agencices about coming to work for them, but i don't want to unfairly start something with them, knowing in the back of my mind i hope to leave within 6 months.<p>i've thought about offering my services as a freelancer, but honestly wouldn't even know where to start. i've been fortunate to be a jack of many trades throughout my career, and while i've been very good at networking with folks, ideally i'd want to be able to work from home 30-40 hours per week to keep the lights on.<p>it just seems to me that given the economy, and the prevalance of sites such as odesk/elance, it would be difficult to get on a project where you can set yourself apart and make a decent per hour wage.  but maybe i'm just skewed by my current situation.<p>i understand that 6 months isn't that long of time to suck it up, and i am very fortunate to have this job, but its tough.  hopefully someone has had a similar experience and can shed some light on what to do.<p>any advice/comments/criticism is welcome.  thanks for your time! 2011-12-07 15:03:49 UTC

4203516 does chrome use a custom-located/built-in flash version? when i visit http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about using google chrome (version 20.0.1132.47) on mac the flash version is reported as 11,3,300,257. however, if i visit the same page using safari or firefox then flash version is reported as 11,2,202,235.  so is chrome using flash installed in some other custom location?&#60;p&#62;also, it's interesting that even if chrome is using a custom flash version, the system flash installer still wants to stop/kill chrome application to perform the update. 2012-07-05 15:45:32 UTC

7256145 to apply or not to apply should i apply for a ui&#x2f;ux designer job at a startup that i&#x27;m interested in although i&#x27;m more of a back end developer.
i&#x27;m a student who has worked as a back end developer for most projects i&#x27;m involved in but i&#x27;m interested in switching to ui&#x2f;ux designing. 
is it better to gather the required skills before applying for an opening or do you think i can mention my lack of experience and willingness to learn in a cover letter.
 or not bother applying at all ? 2014-02-18 03:20:50 UTC

71413 yc: please, give me some feedback on startup business model hi everyone,<p>i need any feedback for my startup's idea and business model and would very appreciate your help.  i don't want to go too deep into details, but one of the major points is that i'm going to ask subscribers to use my own im client to stay connected (well, it could be some open protocol, like jabber).  i wish i can propose something easier, either sms, or email, or other im (icq, aim, gtalk, msn, yahoo, ...).  unfortunately, no one allows to perform bulk messaging (or it's very expensive).<p>from the other side, my subscribers will have motivation to use it, to stay updated and connected.  however, i'm not sure if downloading and installing one more client (and keep it running on your computer) becomes a barrier for a typical user and can keep them away of being my subscriber.<p>what do you think guys?<p>oh, the business model is not connected to advertisement (although, it can take place), so it's not pay-per-view model.  the reason why i am mentioning this, is that recently i've been told that such requirement can lead you to feeling like being back to late 90's, when the market was full of numerous toolbars, advertisement panels, etc and a lot of people still sick of it.<p>thanks. 2007-10-23 04:12:47 UTC

5133301 ask hn: forcing browser updates on users i was about to download wunderlist on a new computer and upon visiting their website, i was notified that firefox is out of date. i couldn't access anything else on the site without updating.<p>this got me thinking- forcing the latest browser version could make things a lot easier in terms of cross browser compatibility, but it could annoy some users. perhaps i have some extensions that are not compatible with the latest updates, so i don't want to be forced into updating.<p>then again, a simple notification could be fine, leaving the choice to update up to the user.<p>what do you think of this practice?<p>what are some of the things you do to minimize the number of browsers you need to support? 2013-01-29 10:53:12 UTC

6863161 ask hn: used dell poweredge c6100 servers + colo or aws? i am a solo bootstrapper and i am trying  to figure out whether i should get 4 x  c6100 servers ( 2 x intel xeon l5639 + 96gb per  + 250gb ssd  - per node , 4 nodes per server)  for about us$7k +approximately  $4k for annual colo charges or scale up using aws. the dell servers are from ebay and their longevity&#x2f;reliability is questionable. i will also be using a managed hub  ( still deciding brand -- but will buy used from ebay)
 i plan to buy four of those for redundancy. the colo would be within driving distance of my home.<p>my environment  has mongo , redis, nginx , beanstalkd and glassfish app servers  and i expect to do a lot of video transcoding  using ffmpeg ( if i manage to get traction).
with dell c6100, i am getting a lot of cpu cores and memory and ssd that i could never afford on aws. i probably don&#x27;t need this kind of capacity in the first few months of my launch but i am hopeful that my business would grow.<p>could hners with more wisdom and experience in these decisions please share their experience with this decision. also feel free to critique this idea.
thanks! 2013-12-06 19:36:23 UTC

1891412 an easier way for startups to find lawyers, accountants or consultants. a new website, www.expertbids.com, recently launched and is an online professional services marketplace. the platform allows individuals and businesses to get free, personalized bids on any of their legal, accounting or consulting work.<p>the work these professionals do is very important to your startup, so clients should not choose a professional based solely on price. on expertbids.com, you can also look at the professional's profile (including license(s), personal websites like linkedin and facebook, and educational information) and also past client ratings to assist you in hiring the right person.<p>being that startups often need either (or sometimes all three!) a lawyer, accountant, or consultant, and usually don't have the resources to do this work in-house, this site may be a great resource to find the right professional for your startup.<p>as with all websites, expertbids.com is still a work in progress and there is no guarantee you will find the right professional, but at the very least you should be able to get a few options on your legal, accounting, or consulting work at no cost to you.  these options are very important when dealing with such critical and expensive areas of your startup. 2010-11-10 18:53:43 UTC

2334048 ask hn: the redesign of my startup, please review it. a couple weeks ago i asked hn to give me feedbacks on my website.  i received great feedbacks and did a revision of my website,  changing the user interface and build a community forum around it.   well the idea of my startup is very simple but i believe very meaningful.   i'm trying to connect local buyers and sellers together via videos instead of photos.  giving users and sellers a better way to showcase their second hand products.   right now we're focusing on users acquisition and marketing but kind of stuck, meaning no growth.  we're getting about 500 visits/day and around 5-10 people register/day but not many people are uploading videos.   we want to get users more involved in the community and eventually list their used stuff with us.   as of now i'm bootstrapping  my startup where capital is very limited.<p>i'm thinking of 
1. reaching out to bloggers and get some pr to increase more traffic to the website.
2. then hire some people to build a mobile app so users can upload their stuff easier and faster.
3. run some contests to motivate them to sell their unwanted stuff lying around their homes.   
4. contact local used car dealers, furniture stores, and yard sale associations offering people to list their products on the website for free.<p>which one of these should i do first or not do at all?  this is my first startup and i know i have alot to learn especially with online marketing.  
please review my startup and feel free to offer any feedbacks or criticisms.  please advise me on 
some marketing strategies for my startup as well.<p>thanks,<p>leon

1719744 upgrade vs.net 2005/2008 to vs.net 2010? hello all,<p>i'm a long-time reader, but this is my first post -- i registered just to ask.  first, i'm a developer, primarily in .net using both winforms and webforms.  i was looking at different codeproject solutions yesterday and came across a great example of how to do something in windows 7; but it was a .net 2010 windows app, using xaml to construct the main form.<p>now i've looked at xaml a little bit, having attended classes at different .net conferences.  the code is easy enough to read, being a lot like html... but with a ton more methods available in each tag.  it seems like learning xaml would be quite an undertaking and that it's geared more towards designers.  i haven't yet seen if all the properties are easily available for each "tag". but working at a smaller company, we don't <i>have</i> someone who works only as a ui designer, and this is the case at most non-enormous firms.<p>so i'm wondering, how many of you are making the transition to vs.net 2010?  ...and of those, how many intend on writing your windows and web apps using xaml?  i know you can use vs.net 2010 without xaml and i think it's the de facto choice for silverlight developers [if not a requirement]... but i'm curious how many of you will be, or already are, using xaml and 2010.<p>any comments would be greatly appreciated! 2010-09-23 14:30:22 UTC

2115888 ask hn: help with monetization for programminginterview.com i have a pagerank 5 website that i made a couple of years ago when i was preparing to interview for tech jobs in boston. i collected a bunch of programming interview questions and wrote my own answers to them in c++ / java, and decided to put them online for posterity.
www.programminginterview.com<p>fast forward to the present - i've quit my job and started working on my own projects full time. i moved to shanghai to conserve capital (lower cost of living versus boston), but unfortunately my funds are running low so i'm looking at my old sites to see if i can squeeze some money out of them to expand my runway.<p>currently i'm just promoting "programming interviews exposed" and other programming interview books on amazon but the earnings are literally chump change, maybe $10 / month max. there are also some affiliate links to thinkgeek.com but they've earned nada. i'm also selling links which i know is bad but it's another $25 / month which is kinda poor for a pr5 site. i used to have a job board but it got little to no traffic so i got rid of it.<p>traffic is pretty good, very solid at 6500+ uniques per month, all very targeted and mostly from google searches.<p>if the community has any ideas on how to improve the monetization of my site i would be eternally grateful! 2011-01-18 14:30:23 UTC

2384479 ask hn: which business idea do you go with? this is an intentionally open-ended question to spark a conversation.<p>i see lots of articles discussing what to do if you "can't think of a good idea". i rarely see mention of the opposite problem: the person with more ideas than (s)he knows what to do with. i know that lots of these people exist. (i think i'm one of them!)<p>how do you compare an idea you expect to be more profitable against one that't you expect to be more fun/personally fulfilling? i remember felixchan posting his story about selling his (booming) badge printing business to focus on an app he was passionate about. many people here strongly disagreed with that decision.<p>then again, maybe that's jumping too far ahead: should you test multiple ideas to see what market traction they have? maybe go so far as to produce several minimum viable products in parallel? how far can you go down this path without stretching yourself too thin? 2011-03-29 21:05:47 UTC

521078 get out and market, here's a sure fire strategy i just thought i’d share a quick strategy for everybody out there that worked very well for a company i’ve been consulting with.<p>first : define what you are an expert in and how that correlates to your start-up. it’s crucial to be interesting – what knowledge do you have that others would be entertained by, but feeds back into your startup solving a challenge? doing something better / faster?<p>second : contact blogs in your target market category and ask nicely to guest blog, use http://technorati.com/blogs/directory/ or http://www.alltop.com or http://www.blogcatalog.com to find bloggers. just fill out their “contact us” forms, but write each one personally.<p>third:  write a 3 – 4 paragraph “article” giving your unique take on the problem you’re working on solving. point out a flaw and how you’re working to correct it. don’t be overtly selling your company, but don’t let anybody miss the point that your start-up is solving that problem.<p>results: 
our contact to post rate was for each 10 emails we got ~2 rejections, ~5 ignores, ~3 successes.
for each success we wrote a unique article. same content, written for each audience specially though.<p>you now have pr friendly inbound links.<p>you now have curious visitors in your target market.<p>and if you’re lucky somebody truly useful will notice and repost. 2009-03-18 03:03:36 UTC

10245703 what makes you choose hacker news over other sites? (re-post) sorry for the re-post but we&#x27;re looking for more participants to our survey. we&#x27;d appreciate it very much if you can take the time to fill out our 5 minute survey (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;surveys.mcgill.ca&#x2f;limesurvey&#x2f;index.php?sid=97446&amp;lang=en&amp;97446x8879x361722=hackernewstwo). you&#x27;re input is facilitating research into better platforms (in terms of quality-discussions and community inclusivity) for social content. here&#x27;s a slightly longer description:<p>ok, obviously there&#x27;s been plenty of talk about different community-driven content sites everywhere. but as a scientist, i&#x27;m curious about social dynamics and want to take a sort of census. i don&#x27;t know if this is considered against the posting rules (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be), but i&#x27;d also like to invite anyone whose interested to take this survey. this survey is part of a study into online social dynamics. we’re trying to understand how people use content aggregation sites, what features affect their use, and what possible issues motivate them to switch between sites. we invite you to help shed light on this important sociological phenomenon by taking a quick approximately 5 minute survey for research purposes about what you like and don’t like about about the content aggregation sites you use. in the long run, we hope the results of this survey will contribute to making the platforms you love even better. it&#x27;s strictly non-commercial and fully anonymous, and we will publish our findings in a blog post (in addition to academic publication) on our site (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;networkdynamics.org). go to https:&#x2f;&#x2f;surveys.mcgill.ca&#x2f;limesurvey&#x2f;index.php?sid=97446&amp;lang=en&amp;97446x8879x361722=hackernewstwo to learn more about the survey and participate.<p>thanks!!<p>the network dynamics group

3516093 occupy hacker news? sorry for the indirection.  i've posted this twice on hn and have gotten virtually no input.  disconcerting because this is very much on-topic for hn.  so i figured i have to "seo" the thing and see if i can get the right eyeballs on the post:<p>after twenty years working as a hardware/software engineer in various fields i am thinking about completing a degree. i never finished mine. i originally went for a ee. took most of the science, math, physics and a couple of programming courses. got bored.<p>by the time i was done with my second semester in college i had designed and built my own robots (as in: machine the parts and assemble, no kits) and all of the computers and electronics to drive them. i implemented all of the low-level code in forth (which i wrote from scratch) and wrote the high level operating software to run on a pc. this project became the subject of a paper i presented at an international conference on the subject. again, school was like being in a slow-motion scene in a movie. i had to move faster.<p>i was designing and programming my own computers from scratch. by that i mean, wire-wrapping chips and writing the bios in assembler, implementing forth from scratch, designing my own floppy disk controllers from scratch and implementing drivers, etc. school felt very slow and painful, i was learning and doing interesting things at a much faster pace on my own.<p>later-on i got in to fpga's and went on to design boards to do real-time image processing in hardware. again, i did the hardware (high-speed design, signal integrity, ddr memory, ghz-range i/o), all the firmware (verilog) and real-time os for an embedded micro (8051 derivative) that ran the whole thing.<p>in all i accumulated experience programming in assembler (various), c, c++, forth, lisp, visual basic, objective-c, php, javascript/jquery, verilog and probably a few more languages.<p>now, years later, i am thinking about the idea of completing a bachelors in cs degree online. the motivations are many. from personal accomplishment to the idea of going further and opening the doors to get into research in a field i love, robotics. i am fascinated by humanoid robotics and want to contribute, but, despite my accomplishments, the lack of degrees stands in the way of participating in that field.<p>i'm wondering what hn members think about the various programs now available. i've looked at university of illinois and a few others. not sure how they all rank.<p>i am also very interested in the possibility of receiving credit for some of what i've done over the years. i mean, i could probably teach some of these courses with some prep. i wonder if these programs allow one to take a test and bypass the class altogether.<p>btw, most programs start in feb/march, hence my hurry in getting some feedback in order to make a decision.  thanks! 2012-01-26 21:32:50 UTC

471802 ask hn: have you read dreyfus's what computers can't do? how did you react? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/what_computers_can't_do<p>full disclosure- my intuition is a strong reaction in the negative but i've only just begun reading his book, and i find it particularly staggering that the introduction frames the debate as open-and-shut, with dreyfus having won.<p>dreyfus's introduction for example spends a lot of time going over the brick walls hit by ai in the mid 20th century. that's compelling for what its worth as it leads to a deeper appreciation for the problems such researchers were trying to solve, but as an argument it's similar to saying that a lack of a man on mars counts as proof that it's impossible for men to get to mars.<p>also, as a general note, i find the approach of supplying strictly philosophical arguments suspicious- there is lots of room for vagueness, and for characterizing ai researchers as taking certain philosophical positions without meaningfully engaging with the fruits of their research.<p>i apologize if that sounds unnecessarily harsh. i do think that i have an obligation to read and seriously mull over these arguments given that i want to disbelieve them so strongly and i'd like to think i'm open to being convinced. so i'm hoping that there is someone in this community who approached this book with a similar mindset who's willing to share their experience with dreyfus's ideas. 2009-02-08 04:03:44 UTC

2456974 ask hn: how do you ensure you web app goes live without a major bug? i have not worked at a lot of companies, so i am a bit in the dark how companies typically test their software (i am specifically interested in web applications).<p>from talking to some friends at mid-size or larger companies, they seem to rely significantly on manual qa testing from their dedicated qa teams. i was actually surprised to hear that many of these people told me that automated testing is virtually nonexistent. or if it does exist, it is simply as a supplement to the manual verification steps.<p>how do smaller companies ensure there are no show stopper bugs when they push some code live? do they rely simply on automated testing, or do even the small guys typically have people doing manual qa? 2011-04-17 20:46:06 UTC

1290072 ask hn: would you use coda for ipad i don't know why, but i just think a "coda for ipad" type app would be an awesome. i wrote an article describing some of the things i think you could distill the app down to, most of the parts are very complex, but seem simple when executed in a great app.<p>the article is here: http://judstephenson.com/2010/04/23/idea-coda-for-ipad/<p>but the real question is, would anyone use it? 2010-04-24 01:52:25 UTC
3900258 ask hn: does doing what your users say they want ultimately end in betrayal? you know the story.  you listen to your users and do exactly what they say they want.  you implement the features they want and you always keep their input in the process. from polls to surveys to comments - everything you make goes by the user.  sounds good in the surface, right?<p>that is until some company who completely ignores their user and does what they think is correct comes along (say apple).  now the users you've been taking care of since the beginning have left your products in droves.<p>what happened?  why did they leave?  you did everything they said but they still left.  what's going on here? 2012-04-27 17:52:55 UTC
130486 ask yc: would you take a short break before the final push? say you had one final push required to complete the beta phase of your startup, maybe 7 days of work total. if you'd been working on the startup for months and felt exhausted, would you a) take a short break now, aiming to complete the project in ~14 days or b) keep marching through clenched teeth and have it done in a week?<p>option b) could be considered difn, i guess, which appeals to me. but a short break is also an attractive prospect right now. i've read elsewhere on hacker news that the hard work doesn't really start until you launch, so is this all the more reason to go with a)? 2008-03-06 11:54:48 UTC

3589858 ask hn: how do i ensure that a real ios client is using an api hello hn! hoping i can tap the colossal power of the hn hive-mind.<p>working on a project where an ios client hits an api. how do i ensure that only my 'real' client is allowed to use it?<p>i could bake a secret token into the app, but surely it will just be sniffed (https only, but a mitm proxy?) or the app decompiled and the token extracted (like the sony ps3 master key).<p>is there any reliable way to ensure that a hacked, dummy version of my app can't use the real api?<p>thanks hn! 2012-02-14 13:22:20 UTC
7613158 ask hn: is it wrong to sell a software product you made to your employer? i&#x27;ve been running up against a few issues within the company i work for that i think could be served well by building software to help manage the issues we face. i&#x27;m introducing a level of vagueness because i don&#x27;t really want people to figure out where i work, but the issue at hand has to do with how my company releases data to our contract manufacturer. (we&#x27;re a hardware company that builds product in china.)&lt;p&gt;on the one hand, i think i have a unique position to help develop the solution, since i&#x27;m one of the ones who has a front-line view of the problem and a modicum of notion how to solve it. on the other hand, i can see this as a problem that other companies would likely have, and would pay to have solved - in other words, a pretty decent business opportunity.&lt;p&gt;does it represent a conflict of interest to build that software in my spare time and then try to sell it to my existing company as a solution? 2014-04-19 11:10:35 UTC
8250041 how do you guys deal with spam comments? as the spamming is increased dramatically and wordpress is a one of the most targeted platform. if you have been using wordpress for a while, you might have noticed thousands of spam comments. actually, i want to know how do you deal with spam comments? 2014-08-31 18:53:51 UTC

3416923 show hn: a hn android app (weekend project) i've  been playing around with android development recently, and made this hacker news app this weekend:<p>market link: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mellort.hackernews ($1)<p>dropbox link: http://db.tt/jlqicbg1 (free: if you like it, dl from the market, too!)<p>i used api.ihackernews.com for the data. unfortunately, some of the pagination from that source is broken, so i can only return one page of results. in the future, i might play around with creating my own api server on app engine.<p>i'm not sure what my plans are for the source yet, but i'd like to make it open source. if you're interested, let me know, and i can prioritize cleaning up the code.<p>this was a make-it-work-and-publish-asap project, so there are obviously a lot of things that could be added, but i'd appreciate any feedback, regardless. cheers! 2012-01-02 19:09:49 UTC

190037 ask yc: who's your role model?  who do you look up to as an start-up/entrepreneurial role model and/or mentor?<p>i was lucky enough to find both a role model and a
mentor in a friend of mine. i looked up to him because i could relate to him. he is my age, started his own company from nothing, worked hard to run his business, and most importantly, inspired me to do the same. he was a big reason why i quit my bigco. job to try the start-up life. he mentored me as well - consistently providing advice, feedback, and constructive criticism.<p>i have a lot to thank him for, but unfortunately now i find like i can't look up to him anymore. i feel like he's become too busy with other things in his life and is no longer pursuing his previous "passion" of expanding his small business and doing more start-ups.<p>so thats how i came to this question - i'm interested to see who other people look up to, whether its steve jobs or steve next door. 2008-05-14 22:06:06 UTC

263676 ask hn: the quest for webapp publicity - now what? hey,<p>i launched streetread.com ( http://www.streetread.com ) about a month ago. thanks again to all of you who provided great feedback after the launch (i added a handful of features and fixed things mentioned). streetread is an innovative, free webapp for wall street investors. it aggregators the headlines for all of the stocks you follow plus over 20 of the leading financial websites, in a nice, ajax-powered interface. checking quotes and news is extremely easy - much quicker than the regular google &#38; yahoo finance, etc.<p>anyway, in the never-ending quest for good publicity and user growth, i'm having some problems. i've gotten about 7-10 great write ups that really helped the exposure (lifehacker, webware). the problem is, i've pitched to hundreds of sites, writers, bloggers, etc, and it seems i can't get much of a response anywhere. it also seems that even sites interested in doing write ups aren't going to be interested in a month old website. i'm running out of publicity ideas and people to pitch to. it's definitely not the type of site you run advertisements for. i truly feel that 9 out of 10 'hobby investors' seeing the site would be very interested. i see sites getting 5 figure registrations within days of launching and just wonder how.<p>any suggestions?<p>thanks. 2008-08-01 02:00:09 UTC

270059 ask yc: need a bit of advice, fellow student is screwing me over on this website. i confess to being a total moron for not getting anything in writing.<p>anyway: i was offered $500 to write a database-backed web app and missed one deadline they gave me. there were a couple occasions where i said i hoped to have it done soon, but didn't. anyway, they never specificed exactly what they wanted, so i pushed out a functional version that had the general aesthetic they wanted, figuring that i could add in other changes once they played around with it a bit. i also had to pay about $300 in hosting, since their hosting wasn't set up to serve anything more than static html.<p>because they think i missed "several" deadlines and the site wasn't what they were imagining, they now want to pay me only $500, instead of $500 plus hosting. effectively, only $200 for my work. my question: should i bargain or just take their new offer, or take down the site? i'm considering bargaining, because the guy's part of an organization, and i'd like the rest of the members to hear my side. what i was thinking was to cc the other person i know in their organization with a defense and a request for the full amount. thoughts?<p>edit: i can cancel the hosting within the next couple weeks and get that money back, so keeping the code and walking away doesn't hurt me financially. 2008-08-07 22:02:34 UTC

618578 ask hn: personality assessments in the workplace? i was talking with a family member recently who told me that his company is going to be administering disc assessments [1] as part of a human resources workshop in the near future.  while he's not so concerned that these would be used directly in future promotion decisions, he does have some other concerns.<p>* he worries that the decision making process of the business could be short-circuited (perhaps only sub-consciously) to allow easier dismissal or acceptance of some suggestions or proposals based on the categorization of the person behind it, rather than on its own merits.<p>* both of us having been raised in the households of psychologists are inclined to believe that personality inventories such as this are pseudoscientific.  we're well acquainted with the forer (or barnum) effect [2] and are not very willing to trust anything based entirely on self-evaluation of 45 or so questions.<p>* even so, he feels that it's the psychological equivalent of being asked to drop trou in front of one's coworkers and is understandably uncomfortable about that.<p>* he seems to be the only one that has severe problems with this.  everyone else seems to be embracing it or at least accepting it as something that you just have to do.  the later option feels intellectually dishonest to him, given the objections above.<p>management is selling this as something that will enable better communication since people will be able to craft their interactions based on the other person's type.  i've recommended that he ask for concrete examples of how they would tell him x if his type were y vs. z.<p>so, does anyone have any experience with these personality assessments in the workspace (or even specifically with disc)?  any good recommendations for how to make these objections clear without becoming a pariah?  or are these concerns exaggerated somehow?<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disc_assessment<p>[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forer_effect 2009-05-20 14:26:32 UTC

there's also a "tweet this" button encouraging users to mention lolstack.<p>my latest development snapshot of the actual site is available on the subdomain "dev" of lolstack.com. feel free to poke around in there. i would love some actionable criticism. 2011-02-09 20:55:54 UTC

2460274 cloud hosting (amazon ec2, rackspace etc), help please? i am currently going through a cost saving excercise and looking at cloud hosting as a possible solution. i currently run 3 dedicated servers, 1 load balancer, a san and a nas.<p>it was only by accident that i came across ec2 from another post detailing how to create a proxy using ec2 to access the internet. quite a revalation as i do love the ec2 platform and how flexible it is. i have signed up to the windows instance to check it out to make sure it does everything i need it to.<p>it turns out it does do everything i need it to but i am a little afraid of the hidden costs. with my dedicated servers, i pay an amount a month and thats it. with ec2 i have worked it out and we will save money but i always feel like i am missing something in the config and if i went full scale with it they i am going to get stung.<p>whats everyones experience with services like this? can anyone offer their experience or advice? any help would be greatly appreciated. 2011-04-18 19:22:33 UTC

2370804 ask hn: are people satisfied with their website analytics? there's a growing number of options out there for web analytics. google analytics being free still seems like the primary tool, but there's a few key areas it falls down. primarily you're stuck in a page view mentality, where if it isn't a page it doesn't matter in regards to goals and funnels.<p>there are some newer players in the space that try to fill some of the gaps of google analytics. clicky attempts to offer real time analytics so you have faster insight instead of the 2-3 hour delay that currently exists for most products. mixpanel allows you to get outside of pageview limitations, essentially giving you a blank slate to track anything, but then it starts to seem very broad as to how deep you have to go and whats effective.<p>having used several of the tools during bootstrapping, i'm still coming away unsatisfied with the insight that each were able to provide. am i entirely alone in my desire for a yet to be found, incredibly useful web analytics tool? 2011-03-25 23:35:14 UTC
1109443 [ask hn] do anyone of you knows a website which offers standard agreements? something including:

2921482 ask hn: should i drop my cs major to pursue being a self-taught web dev? hi everyone, and thanks for clicking. i'm currently enrolled as a music/cs double major at a liberal arts university. i've just finished a summer of doing freelance web development, and i enjoy it a lot, though it can be frustrating at times. but as the beginning of my fall semester looms, i'm realizing that what i'm learning in my cs education is far less relevant to what i actually want to do than what i learn from just starting a new project and googling my way through it.<p>i took two intro classes, one on python and one on java and data structures, and i found those to be great. my class on computer structure, and that was fascinating. but moving forward, i feel like i'm heading towards the wrong niche—when i look at course titles like "automata theory" or "design of programming languages," they're things that i would love to learn, but i just picture myself working my ass off on some proof wondering why i let myself get so off track from something that i enjoy and can already make money doing.<p>am i being naïve, or am i just starting to figure out why so many people say that college is unnecessary? i'd appreciate hearing anything about your real-world experiences that can give me some insight on which direction i should head.<p>thanks!<p>edit: i had to shorten my title and i left out an important detail: i'm not thinking of dropping out of my university, merely doing a music major instead of a music/cs double major. i would likely still take cs classes—there's one on databases that seems very interesting. 2011-08-24 16:57:29 UTC

116929 sql server 2005 vs. mysql for a startup? we are wondering whether to use sql server 2005 or mysql as our database. the database will store the following information (for stocks &#38; bonds):<p>1. market activity information – price, volume, open, high, low, close for various instruments.
2. fundamental information – balance sheet line items, income statement line items, news stories etc.
3. technical indicator values – commonly used moving averages, rsis etc.<p>typical use scenario will be that a browser will request the following information:<p>1. data for an stock/bond
2. data for a certain day/time (across a bunch of stocks).<p>the predominant concern here is : speed. the application should very quickly be able to handle requests and spit out the necessary data to a .net client.<p>do you have any idea what might be the fastest solution in this situation? can you ask your coders for any suggestions?<p>i am tempted to go with mysql since it is free vs. high licensing costs for sql server.<p>the main reason i am considering sql server is because of a notion in my head that if it's a .net/windows application, sql server may be faster.<p>thanks! 2008-02-16 12:09:38 UTC

3143889 ask hn: cto and product engineering manager note: i'm posting this with an anonymous identity<p>i'm currently the cto of a small (7 empl) saas company in spain. we are three founders and an advisor who has little shares. after 3 years of working hard, we finally have a product that people likes and we have had some sales (about 100k soft+services). we are on the way to receive some seed investment, and the advisor told us to get some loans from the government. until here, everything is fine, after 3 years of scarcity and courange, we will finally have some resources that will help us to bring our software to a next level and expand its adoption.<p>the advisor told us about creating and organization chart, to see how we will spend the money. and he proposes the figure of a "product engineering manager", someone responsible of some r+d, vintage chart, and pilot test. that job was made by me until now, basically because after some years i got some expertise on the market, and i tried to push some cool "intelligent" features, but due to the small resources, we focused on minimum viable product.<p>after being told that i would no longer hold this position/job, the advisor proposed someone younger (we are all 28), but who has been working for 3 years in a very similar companies in the u.s. he had an outsourced development team of 30, and they got a nice piece of software. they focused on final client (12 clients), we got a sales channel (35 partners) and (70 final clients) and the amount of items represented in the software was about the same (150). he was supossed to have a bigger salary also.<p>i've said that now we lack of someone to take care of the operations, someone to help the sales channel to setup projects and deploy our software (our software needs some piece of hardware) for really going on volume. but the advisor (and also the ceo-sales manager) told me that what we have to do is to focus more on the r+d on the product.<p>i'm feeling displaced from the position i think i could bring to the next step with some extra resources, and i supose i will end giving support to the sales channel, while someone else plays around with some r+d unit that i've been trying to push for the last year. so, i expressed some doubts on this decisition, and i got a confrontation with the rest of my board (founders and advisor). i even being told by the advisor that if someone gets an advisor he cannot refuse their advices. he added that he is very angry at me, and that i'm putting sticks on the wheels.<p>so, to wrap it all, i face a decistion, wether i fight for the position i think i must work in, or i got displace for the best of the company.<p>ah, just forgot to tell one thing, which is supposed to be irrelevant the supposed rockstar to be hired as product engineering manager is the son of the advisor, with whom we have some common friends that told me that he is desperate to come back to spain.<p>so, what i have to do?<p>thanks! 2011-10-22 17:29:47 UTC

2987536 ask hn: can i help you be more awesome today? (no strings. inquire within.) good morning!! about once every month, i ask the community if there's anything i can help them with. i do this becuase i like this community a lot and totally believe in the whole "pay it forward" mantra. crazy or not, i'm interested in helping you be a little more successful today. i've been calling these "no strings" sessions. (because there are no strings attached.) i've been doing this for a little while, so let me tell you a few things i've done to help others...<p>- i've given some really helpful advice for new-comers to the tech industry and those wanting to break into the field (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2544986)<p>- i'm a product of my own re-invention and like to show others how rewarding it can be (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2545255),<p>- i'm planning educational workshops for our community to learn (cram) on different technologies and how they can be quickly used for different benefits,<p>- i read approximately 600+ different articles, blog entries, and stories each month about what the tech world is doing. (i'm pretty informed!)<p>- i understand good design from bad design. aesthetics are not lost on me.<p>- i have a family (two kids) and juggle a hectic work-life balance (volunteering, full-time gig, building a startup, social life?) that's gradually improving.<p>if this sounds too good to be true, feel free to learn more about who i am and why i do these things at my blog: http://nobulb.com/personas/.<p>if there's something i can help you with, just ask here or @mikegreenberg on twitter. be specific about what you're trying to fix/solve/accomplish. the more details you provide, the better i can help you out. also, i should be able to do your request within 10-15 minutes (a soft time limit so i can spread the love a little quicker).<p>last time, the response was overwhelming and i was still answering questions days later (because i wanted to). if you want to get your question answered sooner (rather than later) your request should be thoughtful, sincere, researched and considerate of other people who might want help, too.<p>cheers!<p>ps: this is how it went last few times i did this:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2877712<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2767448<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2649226<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2544886<p>pps: i'm not asking for anything in return, however, there is one way you could show your appreciation if you felt the need. i'm working on a project and currently doing some validation. if you would consider taking a short 2-minute survey, i would be quite appreciative.<p>survey: http://idjump.wufoo.com/forms/online-identity-and-you/ 2011-09-12 15:07:07 UTC

41303 what's the best online payment processing solution? i'm looking for an online credit card payment processing solution that can handle recurring monthly payments. i'm open to linking off of my site to a hosted provider, so long as i can sufficiently customize the look-and-feel. i'm also open to a lower-level code-it-yourself type of solution. of course i don't want to spend too much time on this, and i want it to be cheap. :) thanks in advance for sharing your experiences. 2007-08-10 17:58:10 UTC

2170554 ask hn:what job roles are suitable for a generalist? pardon me for the new account but i'm long time hn reader and poster, just wanted to remain anonymous.<p>i know there are a lot of really smart people on hn and if possible i'd like to get their opinion on this.<p>let me explain:
i consider myself generalist, i.e. i do not have one special skill.
i'm not hardcore/technical enough to be high end developer/hacker or sysadmin.
on the other hand i understand business and marketing things quite well.<p>in the past i worked as a web developer(frontend and backend), it support person(windows), sysadmin(linux), erp developer, even tried freelancing.
after couple of freelancing years i got into financial trouble and had to quickly find a new job.
then i started to work at position with mixed responsibilities - 50% it and 50% computer unrelated activities.
only then i understood that i'm good at business decisions and dealing with people.
i successfully solved few big problems in the office between employees and manager.
a lot of things that improved our operations(it and non-it) was suggested by me. 
unfortunately i do not get credit for this. my manager gets all the recognition.<p>now i'm little bit lost if i should try to specialize in something and earn better paycheck(i have a family) or try to move into non-technical role.<p>what would you advice to do at this point in life for a generalist?<p>what job roles would you suggest for a person who is technical enough to read code but also is business savvy?<p>p.s. just in case it's important i'm not from us, i live in small eastern european country, but considering to move to a better place.<p>tl;dr what job roles include dealing with technical and business side of things? 2011-02-02 15:30:31 UTC

the textbox can be on top of the webpage, encouraging people to submit a message more than if it's somewhere on the bottom, because of its more prominent (and fixed!) position.<p>using pagination with this style would bring the most recent comments naturally on page 1.<p>blogs often sort comments this way.<p>email threads are usually shown this way, for example in gmail or on the iphone mail<p>it seems this style is more suited to slower, asynchronous conversations<p>comments on the bottom:<p>mobile phones typically have the textbox right next to the keyboard, such as on the iphone<p>people tend to read from top to bottom and they can just keep reading the messages chronologically<p>pagination would be a little weird though, with this style<p>when uou produce a list of items that is autoplayed, such as a music mix, you want to put later items on the bottom, as there is a very strong precedent for autoplaying or numbered lists to have the numbers increase in the downward direction.<p>personally for user engagement reasons i would want to favor the newer messages (and textbox) on top approach, which is what email threads, facebook posts and twitter streams do. since i need the same interface for chat, how alen do you think it would be for people?<p>do any of you know of any links to articles or usabiloty studies that have been done with this? any insight would be definitely appreciated. 2010-12-22 06:30:40 UTC

518097 ask hn: where do uk startups go for advice online ? while i'm building my own startup one of the things i'm looking at is what makes it harder to startup in the uk versus the us. one of the main problems i'm finding is that it's much harder to find uk specific advice online.<p>i've attended various meetups (techcrunch uk, the songkick ones) and they're great for making contacts, but there doesn't seem to be an equivalent on-line community.<p>so where do all the uk startups hangout online ? 2009-03-16 13:06:29 UTC

166607 ask yc: who would you pay to read? along the same lines as yesterday's discussion, whose writing would you pay to read?  keep in mind that for high quality, sporadic writers, payment might mean more frequent writing.<p>here's my list (going alphabetically through my google reader list:<p>definitely:<p>- steve mcconnell's stuff is always backed by research and therefore much more valuable than most thoughts or ideas ( http://blogs.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/rss.aspx )<p>- dan weinreb is rational, thorough, a bit of a legend in my niche, and i'm a bit of an ita fanboy ( http://dlweinreb.wordpress.com/feed/ )<p>- bill simmons (sports writer) is hilarious and my only remaining connection to sports spectatorship ( http://sports.espn.go.com/keyword/feed?query=bill_simmons )<p>- pg ( 	
http://feeds.feedburner.com/paulgrahamunofficialrssfeed )<p>- yegge is funny, and pay-per-post would be a bargain! (	
http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default )<p>maybe/conditional:
- pmarca if he would stay on topic ( http://feeds.feedburner.com/pmarca )<p>- defmacro if it caused more documentation and features to be written for weblocks ( 	
http://www.defmacro.org/rss/news.xml )<p>- ted neward is new to me but climbing the charts (http://blogs.tedneward.com/syndicationservice.asmx/getatom )<p>- jeff moser is coming on strong ( http://feeds.feedburner.com/moserware )<p>- kevin kelley is on the bubble ( http://feeds.feedburner.com/thetechnium )<p>based on previous writing more so than current:<p>- raganwald from a couple years ago - the ruby stuff means less to me than his older topics ( 	
http://feeds.raganwald.com/raganwald )<p>- joel a couple years ago, not joel now (	
http://www.joelonsoftware.com/rss.xml )<p>that's 12 out of 172.  5 were conditional and 2 would be mainly to access archives.  so about 2-5% of authors i read are people i'd pay to read.  what about you? 2008-04-17 18:47:24 UTC

4592778 why was a scam company able to raise $76 million series b? i just stumbled upon this piece on business insider "justfab raises $76 million to create the h&#38;m fashion brand of the web". 
http://www.businessinsider.com/justfab-raises-76-million-to-create-the-hm-fashion-brand-of-the-web-2012-7<p>it kept me wonder why a company with very questionable (i will try to avoid using the word "fraudulent") business model was able to raise big money. didn't the vcs have to do the due diligence?<p>i didn't have any direct experience with justfab. the victim was my girlfriend. back in january or so, one of her friends emailed her a link to justfab, then she bought a pair of shoes from www.justfab.com and never visit the website again. only 8 months later, in early september she was appalled to find out that her credit card has been charged a $39.95 fee for the last eight months. yes, $39.95 for 8 months, without geting anything from justfab.<p>i then did a bit research on the internet. it turned out my girlfriend wasn't the only victim. apparently justfab works like this: once you buy something from their website, you become their "vip member". then you will have to log into their website between the 1st-5th of each month and click “skip this month”. if no action is taken (either skip this month, or cancel your account), they just charge you a $39.95 fee every month.<p>according to the business insider article, justfab "will generate about $100 million this year" in sales, i wonder how much of this $100 million are from people like my girlfriend who simply didn't read their entire 2,500 words terms of service and were unaware that they were charged $39.95 a month for nothing.<p>p.s. after justfab csr refused to refund, i decide to post this story again, hoping it will get upvoted to the frontpage of hn so that more people get to know what is really going on behind justfab<p>pps. anyone could just simply google "justfab scam" to see how many others have been victimized. it's outrageous such large scale scam got unnoticed. 2012-09-30 13:11:57 UTC

8844848 ask hn: does anyone actually hire from 'developer bootcamps'? programs like general assembly and flatiron school are touted as effective ways to mint new developers very quickly, and a bunch of them boast hiring rates over 90% and average starting salaries of 100k or more.<p>and yet, looking around, there don&#x27;t seem to be many jobs for entry-level rails or ios developers. if you look around on job boards, there simply is not much competition for entry-level talent. most of the job growth appears to be in academic stuff like ai and data science which requires at the very least a bs and probably an ms. the run-of-the-mill web and mobile developer positions all demand at least some level of experience (generally 2-6 years). it just doesn&#x27;t seem like there is enough demand for inexperienced talent to make this kind of program effective.<p>but if the stats that these bootcamps throw out are true, there are companies hiring people at $100k who, twelve weeks ago, had never opened a text editor in their lives.<p>if you&#x27;ve hired from one of these programs, what made you turn to them? was it a success? and if it&#x27;s really possible to build a rails developer from scratch in 10 weeks, why not just just do it in-house through an internship program and avoid paying commission to these schools? and why do most companies still ask for &quot;<i>at least</i> a bachelors in cs&quot; for web and mobile development positions? 2015-01-06 15:45:20 UTC

37902 a focused search engine for startup trend followers this is a search engine i made with google custom search to let me search for previous startup news/discussion blogs online easier.<p>i found that the general google search has a lot of unwanted "noise" in its search results. also i read a lot of rss feeds from these startup-focused blogs/forums everyday and quite often i cannot remember where a particular article were from and may need to search multiple websites separately. that's why i created this startup-focused search engine.<p>
it currently is limited to search for startup related news/forums on news ycombinator, techcrunch, startupping, mashable, venturebeat and most read blogs from paul graham, robert scoble, guy kawasaki, don dodge and a lot of other sites (currently ~80 in total).<p>feedbacks are appreciated. 2007-07-31 12:29:19 UTC

8535711 ask hn: experience working with freelancers on startups working with freelance software developers (from odesk, elance, freelancer) on different projects got an idea to discuss this experience in the form of a free webinar, see https:&#x2f;&#x2f;using-freelancers.quickmvp.com&#x2f; for details.<p>i know that lot of startups are using remote developers and freelancers.<p>in my experience advantages are:<p>- you may find a very strong developer with a specific background required
- the cost could be lower comparing to us developers
- most freelance market sites providing optional protection for our funds in case the project failed<p>disadvantages are:<p>- different time zones sometime causing delays in the communication
- you should be very careful selecting a freelancer especially if there is no much feedback for her&#x2f;him
- you may need to log all the communication on the freelance market site in case you want to have the escrow protection for your funds<p>if you used (or using currently) freelancers then could you please share your thoughts about advantages and disadvantages? 2014-10-30 20:46:39 UTC

5546915 feedback of bluetooth integration on educational apps hi, i’m just starting off in the educational market creating simple mathematical games mainly for upper elementary and middle school students.<p>one of the main features i’ve included in my apps is the ability to connect 2 devices together through bluetooth and play competitively or cooperatively within the classroom.<p>my thinking is that some schools will find the use of bluetooth a great choice since many school district may block devices connecting to each other through the wireless network due to security concerns. using bluetooth allows the connectivity to happen just with devices within a short range.<p>i would really like to receive feedback on the technical aspect and my line of thought above of the use of bluetooth.<p>check out my math games here: http://www.mathfilefoldergames.com/my-math-apps/bluetooth-games/<p>having a lot of entrepreneurs on this forum, i  would love to hear how you would go about getting my apps into more schools too?<p>thanks,<p>justin 2013-04-14 14:11:10 UTC

5965589 please give us feedback on our tool for helping ideamakers train their pitching hi good hn-people!<p>lauge, kristoffer, morten and myself (anders) have been working on a small web-based tool (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;pitch.brightloops.org&#x2f;) that aims to help ideamakers practice their pitches. but we need some honest &#x2f; brutal feedback to iterate further.<p>we began building it together because quite a few of the young startups at the danish incubator space we work at have struggled with pitching their ideas to potential investors, advisors, at events like startup weekend (the list goes on).<p>we discussed this issue with our advisors who confirmed this problem, then began discussing how we could address it and started developing the prototype since tuesday. we finished the first version today, so it&#x27;s all very new.<p>we have tried to build the prototype around some insight &amp; feature-requests we gained from organizers and attendants of a past local startup weekend (who also struggled with teams having a hard time pitching), and we would greatly appreciate feedback from you guys.<p>issues with the prototype that we&#x27;re aware of and working on fixing:
- printing in internet explorer 10 is acting up
- the current pitch duration calculation only goes per minute, not per second.
- it has not been tested in internet explorer 9 or below, or in opera. but firefox and chrome should be fine.
- the name &quot;pitcherific&quot; is a working title, any ideas are welcome!
- pasting in text does not activate the character counting, you need to paste and then hit space<p>again, feedback is very appreciated and thank you for your time and interest. in return, we&#x27;d love to give feedback too.<p>- lauge, anders, kristoffer &amp; morten 2013-06-30 12:46:28 UTC

4097260 ask hn: how to protect myself as a 4th tech founder? hello,
i am a veteran tech person (backend developer) and was approached by 3 business people who know me from way back regarding an idea they had. they are looking for someone to help them implement it or at least a prototype with which they could ask for funds. the idea is viable and has something to it, and those people <i>are</i> connected in the right places to push this forward if they like. so unlike most offers gotten before this seems viable. my question is, if i decide to put the time and join them, how can i protect myself/minimize future risks (such as dilution), being a minority in this group [1/4 founder]? are there any online sources or books how to handle such scenarios?<p>notes:<p>* i am aware that the optimal way to go would be to find founders you trust, unfortunately some times for various reasons you need to settle for less.<p>* i assume there is no full proof solution, i just want to know what i can best.<p>* i assume most of those rules would apply for non-tech founders too, but what i am interested in knowing about (if such exists), are unique clauses that can protect tech founders in particular<p>thank you and hope this will help others too 2012-06-11 21:54:43 UTC

8151034 ask hn: which license for an open-source sci-fi book? i&#x27;m writing an epic sci-fi novel. well, i hope it will become epic. i have the whole plot and an ending (and possible ideas for sequel) and i wrote a large chunk of the first chapter so far.<p>i&#x27;m not a native english speaker, and i&#x27;d like to encourage others to chip in with editing or writing new parts of the storyline i have not envisioned yet, by making the book open source.<p>my main goal is to sit in a theater one day and see a blockbuster movie made out of this story. because i love blockbuster sci-fi movies, and quality ones are in short supply.<p>i assume that studios would only make a movie if they can secure exclusive rights to the material.<p>to sum all this up, an open source license is needed that:<p>1. would allow anyone to read it for free<p>2. would allow anyone to contribute to make it a great sci-fi story<p>3. would allow me to sell the story (for, say $1) to the studio we as a community deem best equipped to create a great movie<p>4. would prevent other studios from doing the same<p>the closest i could find would be to use creative commons attribution-noncommercial-sharealike. but if there will be many contributors, we could face problems with item 3. above. i&#x27;m thinking maybe i should require all the contributors to assign the copyright for their contributions to me, so that i could sell the commercial rights to a studio at some point. similar to the way gnu works, iirc.<p>any ideas? 2014-08-08 01:34:35 UTC

moystard<p>replace username by password, and tada, you get the password.<p>not saying here that you should not use alfred extensions, but it is good to be reminded sometimes that something that is initially convenient also leaks your precious credentials to a third party. 2012-09-07 16:32:08 UTC

5413085 ask hn: alternatives to lexisnexis for identity verification services? i am currently integrating lexisnexis services for identity verification services for an application i am working on.  without going into too much detail i'm a little tired of trying to work with them and would love to move to another service provider.  i've spent the better part of the day searching and i can't seem to find anything that's suitable.  anyone know of any moderately established (at least) services i can look into?  we do have a requirement that the provider can perform identity verification of both us and non-us addresses. 2013-03-21 05:16:35 UTC

2837077 u.s. might get downgraded - but do rating agencies matter? i have previously written about the how the rating agencies currently hold a dangerous level of influence over our global economy through sovereign ratings.  with one press release, these agencies can cause massive selloffs and panic in the markets worldwide (see europe).  the ongoing debt crisis has focused many on the question of whether or not our debt ceiling will be raised.  but there is another, equally important, matter that deserves attention: whether or not the u.s. will get downgraded.  if the u.s. raises the debt ceiling, this by no means saves the country from losing its coveted aaa status.  in fact, the standard &#38; poor’s (s&#38;p) rating agency has explicitly indicated that a plan providing for less than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years is likely to lead to a downgrade.  some commentators have cautioned that a credit downgrade, in and of itself, would be devastating.  financial analysts estimate that a downgrade would result in $100 billion more of additional interest expense for the u.s. - per year.  over 10 years, this would be an additional $1 trillion of additional interest expense incurred.  it would seem logical that any plan which contemplates less than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years should factor this in.  so the current plan of ~$2.7 trillion in deficit reduction should probably be around $1.7 trillion.  but this is only true if you actually take the rating agencies to heart.  which brings up a legitimate question: why listen to the rating agencies in the first place?  these are the same agencies that facilitated the real estate bubble and bust by assigning top ratings to debt instruments made up of sub-prime mortgage loans - debt instruments that are now considered "toxic."  the agencies, as thomas beck (author of "constitutional separation of powers: cases &#38; commentary") points out, have long treated u.s. bonds as the gold standard by which all other debt instruments should be measured - even when they knew washington was engaged in a colossal ponzi-type cycle.  it was able to repay its existing debt only by taking on new debt, and then pay that newer debt by taking on more debt, and so on, and so on.  beck, in his article (sourced below) goes on to ask, "could any careful lender conclude that such behavior by a borrower warrants the highest possible credit rating?"  for a country that now borrows $0.40 cents for every $1 dollar it spends, it shouldn’t take a rating agency press release to illustrate that the u.s. is not the same credit it was 10 years ago. 2011-08-02 13:47:16 UTC

it was basically a link exchange for apps -- where developers could put "exchange ads" promoting other participants’ apps will display in their app. in trade for showing these unpaid ads, ads promoting the developers app will be shown on other apps in the admob network."<p>however, google sunsetted it. http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/03/google-sunsets-admobs-cross-promotion-download-exchange/<p>would love to hear from users. 2011-10-12 02:48:31 UTC

6685910 validating underdeveloped or untapped markets i am working on a new startup and one of the issues i am struggling with is that the market i am targeting (online designs) is not well developed yet. i mean, i want to untap the potential of an industry that currently is dominated by players that charge hundreds of dollars per design (and that take weeks) making it accessible only to hundreds of thousands (not the tens of millions i think my product could reach).<p>anyone has any idea on how to validate untapped or not very well developed markets? my gut feeling tells me there is a latent demand for this kind of product: designs (logos, patterns) that are cheap and can be created really fast by any user on mobile devices. my interviews with customers before product launch point into the right direction.<p>a good analogy to understand my point would be the ios&#x2f;android ecosystems which ended up to be much larger than the potential smartphone market in 2007. customers, at that time, didn&#x27;t know how essential smartphones would be until they experienced an iphone. the same happened to the ipad. everybody was surprised except jobs.<p>as i am not steve jobs and i can&#x27;t predict the future, any feedback is appreciated. basically i&#x27;ve been following the best practices and talking to customers but which kind of data would be enough to avoid a false positive?<p>thanks much. 2013-11-06 22:19:20 UTC

63251 is this a good strategy? there are many markets out there where there are middlemen or agents. take, for example, real estate (or, in the olden days, travel).<p>do you guys think it's a good strategy to leverage technology to replace the middleman (i.e. zillow, expedia, etc.)?<p>obviously the middlemen aren't going to like it one bit. in theory, it's great for consumers (more information, downward pressure on prices), but will they fully embrace the service if they still need the middleman (especially if the middleman is reluctant to use the service)?<p>i know there are some obvious answers, but i'm curious to hear other people's opinions on this. 2007-10-04 22:47:05 UTC

3058961 reply by senator schumer to my opposition of the protect ip act dear [redacted]:<p><pre><code>     thank you for your contacting me in opposition to s.968, the protect ip act. like you, i believe that consumers should have access to a vibrant and innovative online community to discuss their ideas and opinions.  at the same time, we must not let the internet become a haven for intellectual property thieves.
 
     the threat to intellectual property owners over the internet is clear. every year, the us chamber of commerce estimates that copyright theft costs our nation about $58 billion in lost output, 373,375 in lost jobs, and $16 billion in lost employee earnings. these numbers present an unacceptable burden to us businesses. in addition, companies may be less likely to innovate because their products may be stolen by intellectual property pirates, creating a drag on the us economy.
 
     the protect ip act addresses the problem of intellectual property theft online, but it also contains important due process protections to ensure that legal activity over the internet is not disrupted.  as you may know, the protect ip act would allow the department of justice to file a claim against a website that 1) has no significant purpose other than engaging in or facilitating copyright infringement, circumventing technology controlling access to copyrighted works, or selling or promoting counterfeit goods or services; or (2) is designed, operated, or marketed and used to engage in such activities. a judge would have to find that a website is intentionally violating intellectual property rights of an american entity before he could issue an order against that site. i believe protect ip act would provide law enforcement and intellectual property holders additional tools to protect american intellectual property from websites while still ensuring the constitutionally protected rights of free speech and due process. the protect ip act currently is awaiting action on the floor of the senate, and i will continue to monitor this bill as it moves through the senate.  
 
     thank you for contacting me on this important issue.  please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if i can ever be of assistance to you on this, or any other matter.</code></pre> 2011-10-01 00:02:26 UTC

9045267 ask hn: how to start as a vc firm? dear hn,<p>my wife recently got an interesting offer. she is basically being asked to start a vc firm. this clearly sounds too good to be true, but everything appears to check out. from what we can tell, the firm appears to be a case of a wealthy individual starting a company to invest their own money, and hiring a small team of people to help them in that task. so far the company has focused on other markets, but is pivoting to focus on seed stage startups in the palo alto, california area. my wife has experience as as an employee at a couple startups, but not with fundraising for them. based on initial discussions with the other employees at the company, no one else does either. as she is the first employee located in this area, she is basically responsible for building the company&#x27;s business in this market from the ground up.<p>so here&#x27;s our question. suppose you had such an offer and had decided to go with it (as strange as this all sounds). where would you start? what would you do? who would you talk to? how would you find and evaluate startups, break into investor social circles, gain entrance to the various start incubators? how would you set appropriate investment goals? how would you avoid the pitfalls normally associated with vcs?<p>thanks!<p>(since this is a throwaway account, if you would like us to contact you, please leave us some way to get your contact info.) 2015-02-13 16:52:09 UTC

5845950 proposal safer email. i am (have been for two months) thinking of starting an email service that is compatible with the current email system, but adds features.<p>-if server is seized by authorities they got nothing;<p>-rsa&#x2f;public key encryption on every email. every user has a public key and incoming mail is encrypted on the server right away. public key is available for every email upon request, then other party encrypts and not the server. (this to integrate with other providers who can adopt this protocol)<p>-probably need downloadable apps (can be simple javascript) to prevent &#x27;man in the middle&#x27; attacks.<p>-private key is generated via a standard procedure, client side, on every login. user password (such as &#x27;correct horse battery staple&#x27;) will be the &#x27;seed&#x27; for the procedure to generate private keys.<p>i need help for this project.

5373707 best web framework for non-programmer beginners (or kids) recently my girlfriend has started expressing an interest in programming.  just for some hobby projects, simple website ideas to collaborate on with me, etc.<p>as i'm a programmer, i'd like to gently introduce her to html, css/javascript, and some simple controller/model/db stuff, but as simply/gently as possible.  it'd be a good excuse for me to learn something new, too - i don't think my day-to-day work in java spring would be appropriate - too huge.  she started learning ruby on codeacademy but i'm concerned that rails might burn her out since i've heard the initial learning curve on that can be brutal.<p>what do you think is the best framework to pick if you're trying to introduce web programming to a non-programmer?  we're biased towards a pro language that we can use on macs, but otherwise agnostic.  also curious what you'd recommend for a kid's first framework since i have similar questions about my godkids and nieces (all in the 8-14 age range). 2013-03-14 08:01:39 UTC

simon says game is available on the app store for free. yes, we don’t like ads too! simon says game is designed for iphone , ipad and ipod touch. simon says game requires ios 6.0 or newer.<p>app store link: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;appsto.re&#x2f;gr&#x2f;fe_1z.i<p>have fun! 2014-05-05 13:31:13 UTC

(i guess there is specific answer for every country&#x2f;region&#x27;s law)<p>2. since i plan to provide an online service accessible world-wide, where should i be filing trademark applications? every country where i will operate? (currently, i see as a best option to file an application for us and&#x2f;or eu)<p>3. when should i be trademarking - when i did my research on trademark availability (in the us) for my app&#x27;s name, i decided to check the trademarks of some big companies such as apple and facebook and to my surprise, facebook&#x27;s seems to be filed oct. 2010 and granted in 2011. there is explicit statement for first used and first used in commerce which points to apr. 2004, though. does anyone know anything about such <i>retrospective</i> trademarking?<p>i am trying to do my planning as agile as possible, but since my effort is to bootstrap my company, i need to plan accurately and far in advance the big expenses i will have around incorporation.<p>big thanks to the people that will shed some light on this distant-to-my domain of expertise topic. 2013-08-11 06:04:42 UTC

2853368 (email from twitter) twitter account password hacked -- suspicions so, i found my twitter account password has been hacked. the password wasn't very strong because i don't really care much for twitter. it's the same password i've been using for all my accounts i don't have an investment in -- regardless, the same combination of letters and numbers on all these accounts has served me for about 8 years. 
i don't think the account was 'brute forced' as they say, i think i know how they got it though and why they want it so badly.<p>how:
the last month or so, i've been using these 'login to comment' with your xxx (google/fb/twitter etc...) account on various sites that run an article and have a comments section at the bottom. i must admit, i'm starting to pay less attention to exactly what these sites are when i select to comment with my twitter account. i know it's just easy and after you do it once, other times just seem to be the click of a button. 
as the twitter email i got confirmed, it seems to be a 3rd party app which had access to my info. the only apps i have allowed, were the ones needed to accept comment registration. go figure.<p>why: 
i've heard about these companies selling twitter followers to politicians or to companies needing on line promotion. i've heard of investigations where up to 92% of a boastful politician's followers have been bought. fcuk everything about that.<p>well i'm off to change my password thanks to a handy detection from twitter. i've already confirmed the old one is no good by logging in to twitter independently. maybe i can pin down who was responsible by seeing if i'm following anyone i wouldn't normally.<p>i hope this post was somewhat interesting. thanks for listening. 2011-08-06 07:58:53 UTC

1505310 ask hn: what do you think about dangerous additivies in kids gear? yesterday i went shopping for a music box for my soon to be born child. at home we found a review of a similar music box from the same manufacturer, which got bad grades for containing aniline in a surface exposed to touch (toxic, absorbed through the skin).<p>i am also reading "ecological intelligence" (by the "emotional intelligence" guy), going on about similar topics.<p>in general, it seems very hard to find anything that is not polluted. i would be curious how smart people from hn think about this problem.<p>is it maybe just overblown hysteria by some "treehuggers"? perhaps a little toxin here and there won't kill you, not even if you are a toddler. somehow most of us grew up mostly ok, and chances are 20 or 30 years ago the situation was even worse. there were probably even less "watchdog companies" around to at least curb the problem a little bit.<p>on the other hand, a lot of it seems just superfluous, which makes it extremely annoying to me. it's one thing to add preservatives to colors and food to make them last a little longer, but to add lead to colors to make them seem brighter just seems criminal (apparently a very common problem). it makes me want to avoid those products out of principle, no matter how severe the real danger.<p>the whole consumer experience is also extremely sub par. apparently the companies mentioned in "ecological intelligence" (like goodguide.com) are at least working on an api and iphone apps, but it seems unlikely they would help for my country (germany). the leader in germany ("ökotest") does not seem to be that far yet. i seriously consider doing some work in this space - might be difficult to come by the data, though. i wonder how expensive it is to test a product? goodguide does not seem to test that extensively either, they mention some x-ray test that can detect a limited amount of chemicals on the surface. no idea about chemistry, but i imagine perhaps one could vaporize a product and then see what comes up in the spectrometer?<p>back when i still read computer magazines, i eventually realized that all the tests just had to find some flaws. even if a tested pc was really great, then the testers would suddenly start nitpicking about some minor detail. naturally, all the buyers would run into the shops and nag about that aspect of the product. so i wonder if a lot of the "ecological tests" are a bit the same. if you look long enough, of course you find some flaws.<p>on the other hand, as a consumer, my trust into the industry has definitely been completely destroyed (they also sell us sweets, coke, garbage products recycled as food and what not and claim it is healthy - no, definitely no trusting there). 2010-07-11 10:32:12 UTC

1241274 change for us around 2004 to 2007 there were more and more signs which indicated the upcoming housing crises. but with all the information floating around it was not all that clear how it will turn out, now we know much better.<p>i see the same kind of news and discussion increasingly happening on which way the us will move. latest news say job market is getting better at the same time more articles start to say america will go bankrupt. well, the country itself does not go bankrupt, but if the government can not fulfill the payment obligations there will be consequences.<p>one direct risk is when foreign investors start to significantly draw down the investments into the us. what will be the ramifications in the next years to come if us does financially go under? 2010-04-05 03:20:40 UTC

2819558 gamifying a certain field and building an api, whats it worth? just a quick question here, i am looking for opinions of other developers and possibly other freelancers as well.<p>i have made a name for myself over the past few years as a guy who can get things done with my software, i've built apps for sleeps shops, oil and gas companies, game companies, individuals and medium to large scale business operations ranging from wholesale fence to restaurant pos to bio technology.<p>in doing this i have almost exclusively declined equity stakes in favor of cash deals.<p>but recently i was hit up by a friend/acquaintance of mine who i respect and who no doubt has some business acumen. we have been tossing back and forth ideas about a project to work on together, but from the first convo to now the it has grown from a basic facebook app to a full scale web service with a fully functional api and capabilities to scale in a potentially infinite way.<p>obviously this puts a little more time and pressure on me while also raising the bar from the original project scope.<p>per my request i will be the sole developer on the project unless i deem help necessary at which time i will have discretion over who is hired and for what.<p>but my real question is, what(in equity) should i expect from a project like this? i have already said that any expenses incurred will have to be picked up by them, but what else should i be looking for here?<p>a deal that once looked good to me and that could be fun looks like it could turn into a monster of a project.<p>i would greatly appreciate any thoughts or feedback on this subject and look forward to hearing similar stories with both good and bad outcomes 2011-07-29 00:00:58 UTC

10217950 dsp programming for vst instruments and effects? hey, 
i currently work in distributed computing especially in the video domain and primarily have been interested in functional programming in the last few years - i&#x27;m currently a scala developer.<p>i&#x27;m wondering a couple things:<p>1) if i wanted to play with producing vsts&#x2f;aus - especially instruments - are there any decent resources for getting into this specific problem domain? it seems a bit aloof relative to more prolific areas like distributed computing.<p>2) are there any functional programming approaches - eg languages and libraries - that are widely used in audio dsp? i don&#x27;t think imperative languages would fit quite as well as functional programming as you can just string a signal through a series of functions, and re-arrange them to produce some sort of signal path - that seems logical to me from what i know of analog signal processing circuitry.<p>3) what sort of math would i want to get up to speed with if i was to venture in this direction? i&#x27;m assuming that there is a lot more mathematics that become apparent when working with digital audio and processing&#x2f;altering it.<p>thanks in advance for any insight - it&#x27;s hard to research the field as very little information appears to be available. i can see this one book here:

(solved) (first an apology, this question adds little to the hn community, and am only asking it here as an almost last resort.)<p>i&#x27;m trying to find an article on hacker news that i read recently about arguing tactics. it mentioned that when you argue with someone on a subject that they&#x27;ve based their life philosophy on, they are more likely to push back hard. but if you try some of your more weaker arguments on them, they are more likely to be receptive.<p>i&#x27;ve tried googling, scrolling through hacker news and duckduckgo, (which is actually surprisingly good!). my next step is ask metafilter then set up a paid task on taskrabbit.<p>as an aside, i wish google had a multi-line search box and i could just throw &quot;search clues&quot; in until i find what i&#x27;m looking for -- it&#x27;s annoying having to google, then perturb your keywords, re-google, perturb, re-google etc.<p>edit: big thankyou to _pius and arink 2013-08-30 03:00:40 UTC

7016099 ask hn: if ipad cpu is now "desktop class", why does the browser crash so much? i have a new ipad mini with retina, and it amazes me how often the browser crashes. also, when not crashing, it still has issues with far more websites than my laptop browser does (either in osx or win7)<p>why is this the case?<p>i&#x27;m pretty sure the current ipad has a better cpu and likely more ram than laptops had a few years ago, and yet laptop browsers were never as problematic as browsers on my ipad.<p>laptop browsers work on more websites and are more stable. why is this the case? 2014-01-07 07:08:04 UTC
9003307 ask hn: pre-seed startup, should we get patents filed before demo day? how much would a patent filing (i.e. it would be patent pending) on biometric technology increase valuation for a pre-seed two-person team startup based in london and funded by an accelerator?<p>we have two options:
1) focus on getting end-users with an app we will be releasing to showcase our tech
2) focus our time on filing a patent<p>due to time to the demo day we can realistically focus only on a single point. could not find a definite answer myself, so asking has anyone been in similar situation?<p>i appreciate there cannot be a binary yes&#x2f;no answer, so i am really looking to better understanding the tradeoffs based on first-hand experience! 2015-02-05 14:14:56 UTC
6125222 ask hn: tools to achieve your goals? are there any apps that allow you to set goals at a certain due date, and then let you subdivide the goals into smaller subgoals and set due dates for those as well? 2013-07-30 03:18:22 UTC
1427542 ask hn:need advice regarding career dear hn,<p>i am currently working as a web/ filemaker developer for a university. lately though, it's just been managing projects and more of filemaker work vs. web development. with a few personal issues and this scenario, i haven't really been able to devote time to development and learning and lost touch so as to speak. ultimately, i'd really want to start something of my own but i feel i am at loss to hack it because i am not as strong at development  as i used to be a few years ago. i feel i've missed out on a lot of newer technologies that are becoming a standard today.<p>with rapidly changing scenario in terms of the web technologies (viz. ruby, python, php5, nosql, cloud computing, et al.), what would be the best path to reboot myself and bring myself up to speed with the going-ons today. also, what would be the direction to go in as far as working on something new in education or web in general goes?!<p>pardon me if the my question isn't too coherent. 2010-06-13 15:19:26 UTC
3866132 battle: //url.tld vs http://url.tld vote for your favorite below. or upvote if you prefer sharing urls without "http:", and downvote if you prefer keeping "http:" in the picture.<p>==============<p>can we agree to drop the use of "http://www.google.com", and let browsers and email clients auto-generate urls from "//google.com" instead?<p>which do you favor for use in print, email and advertising?<p><i>option a (http://)</i><p>------------------<p>http://google.com<p>http://facebook.com<p>http://mint.com<p>http://news.ycombinator.com<p>http://voice.google.com<p><i>option b (//)</i><p>-------------<p>//google.com<p>//facebook.com<p>//mint.com<p>//news.ycombinator.com<p>//voice.google.com<p><i>option c ()</i><p>-----------<p>google.com<p>facebook.com<p>mint.com<p>news.ycombinator.com<p>voice.google.com<p>let's see where the community stands. what barriers exist to shortening the syntax for http and https resources to "//url.tld"?<p>if hacker news supports the shift, web 2.0 might just might support the change.<p>one proposed measure of spectacular success: if google mail staff reading this thread devote development time to prefilling the "//google.com" link destination to "http://google.com" when users highlight and link text that reads "//google.com", and promote this as a flexibility feature to its 350 million active users.<p>(if google promotes "//link.com" as a secure simplicity feature, we'll save ourselves googols of keystrokes, and enable enhanced textual clarity and reading speed for urls printed in-line in emails and on paper.) 2012-04-20 01:39:59 UTC
7857917 ask hn: opinion on the landing page of my startup hello,<p>it&#x27;s still in a test page<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;test.bluetouchdev.com&#x2f;<p>we&#x27;re about to officially launch the app at the end of june, with press release, video and everything - we&#x27;re actually already in the app store, without any kind of promotion, pretty good results -<p>i&#x27;d love some honest opinions about the contents (correct grammar? i&#x27;m italian!) and the general ideas and copywriting.<p>for example:<p>- the advertising, is it good to &quot;promote&quot; it even if we still haven&#x27;t really started to work on it? just planned how it will work.<p>- ask for a donation is a good thing? we don&#x27;t have any external funds, and for now we don&#x27;t have any revenue to pay servers and extras (we planned how to get revenue, but we need some months before launching the new features)<p>best,
filippo<p>the contact form is not working at the moment. 2014-06-06 14:06:19 UTC
3596206 ask hn: has this been made yet? after a bit of googling, i couldn't find a service that could help me find out if my friends were busy or not.  i have a few close friends that i talk with on a regular basis, but there are a lot of other people whom i still consider my friends that i don't.  i don't care about sharing my videos, pictures, and thoughts with them online; i would just like to meet up with them in the real world.  when i have free time, it would be nice to see who else is free.  facebook would do a good job of this, but my "friends" mostly post up song lyrics or other clutter and a lot of them i hardly know. is there any service out there that is something along the lines of:<p>-i'm bored/ have free time<p>-i sign on and click a button that says so<p>-it gives my location to my friends which can be found like how facebook does it<p>-i can see other friends who are bored and message them to hang out<p>-other buttons like i'm free to chat/text<p>-(maybe) a section i can go into that shows me other people reasonably close by that
  a. are free to hang out
  b. do in fact want to meet new friends<p>if it exists already, i'd love to know what it's called.  if it doesn't then it's a nice idea for a mobile app. 2012-02-15 21:40:35 UTC

6040991 ask hn: is java still the best way to create a client-side http proxy? i am creating a 3rd party device management system for a client.
&lt;p&gt;basic operation:
&lt;p&gt;users of this system will be receive a link in their email and when they click on the link it will open a webpage that hosts the proxy. the proxy needs to be able to scan the user&#x27;s subnet and access the user&#x27;s local devices over https. once the proxy has obtained the relevant information it will send that data over the internet, back to the central server. one thing to note is that the proxy needs to be able to make authenticated get and post requests to the local devices.
&lt;p&gt;ideally the proxy would be able to call javascript functions as it completes as this allows me to easily change the ui without recompiling and resigning the proxy.<p>&lt;p&gt;currently the plan is to write this in java as an applet but java seems to be becoming less and less popular. is there a better technology to do this, like flash or something else? i considered pure javascript but i think the local devices need to supply special headers to allow cross site requests and unfortunately they don&#x27;t.
&lt;p&gt;how have you tackled this problem and were there any gotchas? 2013-07-14 14:48:50 UTC

7054269 "i don’t want young black kids to aspire to be rappers or ballers." “coding is a beautiful thing,” he says. “if there is a god, he definitely codes. there are fail-safes in the world. that’s code. i don’t want young black kids to aspire to be rappers or ballers. even lawyers and doctors—those are service positions. i want them to be coders. they can make their own worlds then. they don’t need anybody else. i love hearing those kids’ ideas, all these kids on the internet. the excitement of making something, that’s the spark of god.” 2014-01-13 23:16:51 UTC

1015675 ask hn: i've got programmer's block i'm a programmer. maybe not a professional one (yet), but it's safe to say i can write programs in codespeak. i started with ruby, looking at erlang and haskell. picked up a few c++ and java books, but i can't stand them. it's like trying to read the lyrics to any 50 cent song. i'm still working on them though.<p>my problem is that i can't seem to get my ideas to follow up. i think my problem is that i've picked far too big/complex projects and then hitting a brick wall.<p>what do you (hn) do to get past programmer's block? also, what do you do to keep yourself from getting fed up with programming? 2009-12-26 03:40:38 UTC

&gt; javascript
&gt; jquery
&gt; html&#x2f;css (i was thinking of using picnic.css)
&gt; ruby
&gt; ruby on rails<p>my idea was to start it in ruby only and make it a command line game but i think that is a bit counter-productive since i want to use all my skills so i can push my skillset.<p>any help is appreciated!! 2014-09-22 20:30:40 UTC

1563715 ask hn: what is the success/failure rate of startups? this link from yesterday got me thinking about this interesting question again: http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/30/conway-numbers/<p>so, if i start an average startup today, with an average team and an average idea, how big is the chance that it will be a success within five years from now?<p>i know this is a very hard question, because it depends on so many things, and it is also kinda hard to come up with a good definition of what a startup is. perhaps a good definition of a startup is a company that has received funding (and therefore some kind of external approval/stakes in it)?<p>but let's discuss anyway :) 2010-07-31 13:50:08 UTC
2113612 show hn: we've just announced our 2nd product (papyrs) of our small saas startup part of the whole hn philosophy is to launch early and iterate often, so in that spirit we'd like to present www.papyrs.com - our new saas product. some feedback on the concept (or on the way we present it) would be invaluable.<p>is it clear what our product does? any other first thoughts?<p>ps: inspired by hn (and guided by the common sense advice) our first product turned into a full time job. that was a big milestone for us! 2011-01-17 21:53:24 UTC
2562993 ask hn: i just got my ipad 2 from us, which would you recommend as must-have? as the title says, i just got my ipad 2 from us and i'm eager to know which apps you guys would recommend as must-have. thanks in advance. :) 2011-05-19 05:34:03 UTC

1779873 ask hn: any interest in this api as a service? i put this together to use for a couple of personal projects and thought i'd see if there's any interest in something like this as a pay service.<p>it's essentially a hosted rest-like api for job scheduling - give it a cron expression or a single time in the future and it notifies the application by http/s callback at the appropriate moment(s).  you can provide an arbitrary payload to be delivered along with the callback containing identifying state.<p>i'm using it mostly for scheduling test executions and user lifecycle management, but i imagine it could be useful for quite a bit more.<p>so, is there any demand for this?  if so, perhaps i'll take part in the launch-in-november push going on now.<p>i threw together a document on the api with more details - comments welcome!<p>http://job-scheduler.info/ 2010-10-11 14:47:12 UTC

1507927 ask hn: any automated tool to diagnose a slow pc? my pc with windows 7 (yes i know i should be using linux but habits die hard) is slow, dead-slow. i have tried every trick of the trade to find out what is causing it to slow down but no success till date. anti-spyware check, antivirus check, hardware is up to date (4g ram, core 2 duo), defragmentation check, startup list check, services check. i have exhausted all possibilities, and am extremely frustated by my inability to fix the issue. is there any system-level tool (or automated) that can help me find out what is slowing down my pc?<p>the first two browsers i open (no matter which ones) bring the whole system to a crawl; third one is the one that works. and if i load a flash movie on youtube, it causes the system to completely stop responding. sometimes the audio is choppy too.<p>ps: i realize hn may not be the best place to ask this question but then i also realize that inspite of being a techie if i am unable to diagnose my slow pc, what about millions of other non-technical users. is the only option for them (and perhaps me) is to format and reinstall (or perhaps move to a different os). is there an opportunity for a startup here? 2010-07-12 14:39:30 UTC

9066359 rsync offering $24k referral bonus for petabyte signup hello,<p>from time to time over the years, customers have asked if rsync.net has a referral program or any referral bonus available.  typically the answer has been no - we try to keep things simple and want to concentrate on our product.<p>however, our petabyte scale product, which we introduced last year, does indeed have a referral bonus.<p>that bonus is usd $24,000.<p>this product is simply a much, much larger volume of the same product you are currently using - you can read about it here:<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.rsync.net&#x2f;products&#x2f;petabyte.html<p>our pricing for petabyte-scale storage is 3 cents per gb, per month - which makes it price-competitive with amazon glacier, when you consider that we do not charge for usage&#x2f;bandwidth&#x2f;transfer.  it easily beats amazon s3.<p>if you make an introduction, or otherwise refer to us a customer whose requirements are in the petabyte range, we will pay you a referral bonus of usd $24,000.<p>please do email us to discuss further if you believe you can make such a referral.<p>thanks,<p>john kozubik

9671535 do you think i need a cofounder? hello hn,
so i am a 17 year old student who is running my own startup, passwhiz. you can check it out at passwhiz.com   it&#x27;s been a crazy ride and i have almost 4,000 users. i am now out of school and want to dedicate some serious time to selling this product. selling involves a lot of emailing and chatting with high schools and middle schools. while i do enjoy talking to the schools i think have a co founder who has done this before, or just someone to help take some of the workload could be pretty useful. what do you think? do you have any advice for someone in a position like this? 2015-06-06 17:31:58 UTC

7924837 ask hn: i bought my first-ever smartphone. now what? hi,<p>after spending the last 9 years using a nokia 1100, i just bought very first smartphone yesterday - an htc desire 816. it can safely be said that i&#x27;ve missed most of the &quot;mobile&quot; revolution and basically used my old mobile phone as just that - a phone, i made and received calls and sent and received text messages. now , after purchasing this device (which runs android 4.4.2, by the way), i am at a loss about what to do, what to install etc.<p>i am a sysadmin who writes writes small pieces of software by night. i have installed juicessh and evernote thus far. as for social apps, it came pre-installed with the fb app and whatsapp, of which i&#x27;ve tried the latter for the first time last night.<p>i don&#x27;t know what else to install&#x2f; use this for. so i&#x27;m asking the community for help to understand this device&#x2f;os and what it can be used for. any help suggestions will be appreciated. 2014-06-21 12:49:45 UTC

1757623 review our mashup: crowdtube.tv i'd love to get some feedback on a recently launched mashup idea. http://crowdtube.tv finds trending youtube videos and plays them like a never-ending tv show.<p>built on django, we use cookies to keep track of what you've watched(may move toward html5 local db...but trying to avoid register/login), and we use jquery/ajax to make it feel like a tv station.<p>a little background:<p>i'm always annoyed when i try to watch short youtube videos on digg/reddit/etc... while i'm eating or just chilling on the couch, and pretty much hate cable tv with a passion, so we built this out of necessity to fill the void.<p>while i'm not an active contributor here, i know the community is great at giving open, honest, and constructive feedback on ideas...so i'd really appreciate to hear what you think.<p>thanks!

4816537 why i built *yet another* image sharing site? i've built http://www.pixbin.us because i could not find any image sharing site out there that wasn't getting on my nerves in one way or the other.<p>i just wanted a way to quickly share an image on irc (or some im, or even twitter) without the need to register or login.<p>i wanted a site that <i>wasn't cluttered</i> with "recent photos" or &#60;insert social network here&#62; comments and likes and what not.
when i shared (or received) an image i wanted to do just that, show an image to someone, on a clean uncluttered page via a shortened url.<p>i didn't want to make any kind of albums or do any kind of image organizing. i wanted to post it, and then forget about it and let the image expire automatically after 24 hours.<p>basically i wanted a pastebin but for images. hence, pixbin. :)
hope you enjoy it. 2012-11-21 22:00:45 UTC

(i looked at startups.alltop.com, but it seems that most of that is not very high quality -- it seems to be there simple because the blog has the word "startup" in it. there are a few exceptions).<p>i'd really like to see where you read about startups, which reminds me, i need to add killerstartups.com.<p>plus, there are no pictures. pictures break up the monotony of getting news from text, imho.<p>3. are there any sites (or feeds) that show videos re: startups? pictures?<p>thanks! 2008-12-08 21:15:35 UTC

9517990 ask hn: depth or breadth? i&#x27;ve been a &quot;full-stack&quot; programmer since finishing my master&#x27;s in cs 6 years ago. my job had evolved from full-time coding to more of a management position until i switched jobs to get back to full-time coding. i&#x27;m currently working with some very senior developers and get to work closely with them and learn their tricks.<p>i enjoy coding, but i find that doing nothing but coding is starting to wear me down. i could stick with it for another couple of years, but i&#x27;m realizing that my long-term career goals are probably more in a &quot;development manager&quot; type of position where i can still be close to the code, but don&#x27;t necessarily spend every day writing it.<p>i&#x27;ve been offered a sales engineer position within the same company, which isn&#x27;t what i&#x27;d want to do long-term, but it would be a nice opportunity to gain breadth in my field. i&#x27;d be exposed to a lot of new technologies and would gain a surface-level knowledge of dozens of new tools. this position sounds refreshing and like more fun to me than what i&#x27;m doing now, but i&#x27;m unsure about the long-term career prospects&#x2f;compensation&#x2f;stability in these positions compared to a full-stack developer. (are these valid concerns?)<p>i&#x27;m not sure how to proceed. if i don&#x27;t plan to build my career around writing code 24&#x2f;7, is it worth my time to try to build myself up from a &quot;b+ programmer&quot; to an &quot;a programmer&quot;? or should i switch and focus on gaining breadth in my field? 2015-05-09 22:54:36 UTC

2430346 ask yc alumni/hn: please advise on strategy. we have applied for s11, but we were not invited for interview. (our product has just reached pre-alpha stage for the submission deadline.)<p>we think we have what (according to yc) is the most important to build a successful startup: we (the founders) get stuff done, we have the brains, we have a great friendship, and are used to working together.<p>however, we are not that great in selling ourselves (or our stuff), and we suspect that this might have been one of the main reasons we did not get in this time. (of course this might be just wishful thinking: it's also entirely possible that we are simply not good enough, but since in this case, we are doomed anyway, we are planning for the other possibility.)<p>now we need to decide the strategy for the next steps. we see several possible courses of action:<p>a) progress with development in our spare time (with no funding), and retry yc for w12.<p>b) try to get an other mentor/investor, possibly from europe. (this would probably exclude us from future yc batches.)<p>c) put the project on hold, and try to get a (developer) job in the bay area. then move there, and (while working on a different project, for someone else) try to do some networking. apply for yc w12. (the rationale for this plan is this: we are based in eastern europe (not the best place for startups, anyway), and we don't really know anybody in the bay area, or in the startup world, in general. changing this might help us seeing ourselves with your eyes, and thus presenting ourselves better. developing our english would not hurt either.)<p>d) something else.<p>what do you think would be best course of action?<p>thank you for your help. 2011-04-10 20:38:46 UTC

5622491 ask pg: how could this article not be of interest to hn and hackers? this link was submitted yesterday (i found this out when i tried to submit the same link today) and much to my surprise there are 12 others who submitted, but no comments most likely because it never made it to the front page or was merely submitted at the wrong time.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5619630<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/technology/how-big-data-is-playing-recruiter-for-specialized-workers.html?ref=business&#38;_r=0<p>this makes me wonder how many other things aren't making it to hn and about the lack of transparency as far as how items get to the front page which clearly involves both votes, comments as well as a manual "approval" by admins. 2013-04-28 19:52:33 UTC
2818128 i'm 14 and looking for computer-related online jobs first of all, i'm not doing this for the money. it's been almost 7 years since i first started using computers and soon it turned into a passion.<p>and now that i am knowledgeable enough (at least more than an average user), i'm looking for "work from home" online jobs where i can practice my passion on a professional basis, while maintaining the 14 year old minimum age eligibility.<p><i>here's a little background on me:</i><p>* i'm 14 year old, currently studying in 9th grade.<p>* i'm not from us or any other english speaking countries.<p>* i've been using computers since i was 7 years old.<p>* i can easily use linux via the terminal, but i'm still learning shell script.<p><i>some examples so as to give an idea of my experience:</i><p>* i can do basic virus removals and i don't use anti-viruses, just a full scan on an interval of 2 months, so far i haven't been affected.<p>* i tweaked my 6 year old pc to boot within 30 seconds (with xp, linux boots much faster)<p>* i'm aware of the basic workings of the most of the technological softwares/programs/services on a wide base.<p>* i'm currently learning programming (python and shell scripting)
i'm currently not into hardware as much as i'm aware of softwares.

4065732 ask hn: how do you convert your emails to todo items? i'm looking for specifics on tools and workflows you might use.<p>i currently use evernote to maintain my todos and tasks in a somewhat gtd way (i basically did this when it was on hn before http://ruudhein.com/evernote-gtd).<p>the problem is that i have two email solutions (gmail for personal and outlook for work) and a lot of the emails i get become tasks.  i want to keep the context of the email, so ideally i want a way to keep the whole thread, including updates.<p>for gmail i can copy/paste a link to the thread.  i haven't found a good solution for outlook yet (it should be noted that i can use any imap solution, so using another client is an option).<p>so, hn, how do you unify your email and tasks? 2012-06-04 20:14:10 UTC
1399956 ask hn: i'm building something for the airline industry.. ..and i'm stuck at a point of whether i should allocate more resources (time and money) to building the product, or going out there and asking the airlines for ideas/needs behind the scenes.<p>it's really a business development question i have. i'm currently building what i assume is highly attractive to the airlines and consequently their customers, but my feature list is running low because i can't justify anything beyond the minimal stuff.<p>1) if you're in my position (2 person team), how would you get in touch with biz dev guys at airliners? i'm assuming they're the right people to try to contact for partnership deals.<p>2) there is an opportunity to take what i've done + the idea and apply to a local incubator. it's a summer program, and the deadline is approaching fast. biggest downside is that they're asking for 10% with $5k + $5k per founder. it won't get me in the same network caliber of ycombinator, but it's probably better than doing it on my own.<p>any advice? thanks 2010-06-03 00:33:55 UTC
8010465 ask hn: i have $1000 per month and 12 hours a week free. looking for ideas. i&#x27;ve created a budget and am successfully saving around $1,000 per month. my cost of living is low and i have no debt. i&#x27;ve worked out that i have about 12 hours per week (mostly on weekends) to commit to a side project.<p>i&#x27;m looking for ideas. i&#x27;d like to develop my sales and product sense, so i&#x27;d rather create a business selling physical products rather than saas or consumer software&#x2f;apps. candy japan is a big inspiration.<p>i could get a return on the cash with the standard personal finance approach, but i want to generate a return on my own.<p>do you have a successful small-capital business, or an idea that might work? 2014-07-09 16:21:47 UTC

8261758 could reddit have been as big of a success as facebook? reddit has certainly made a massive impact on the online community, but perhaps it could have many times bigger. is is possible that they could have gotten to a ipo, with a market cap of tens of billions of dollars? specifically, were things like the reddit marketplace a short sighted way to monetize the site and the expense of growth? it seems like this is something facebook would have vehemently opposed to. 2014-09-03 06:29:53 UTC

1874043 ask hn. are we doing it all wrong? we had an alpha version of our personal finance app last week and released it on hn/reddit for review. based on the feedback, we have redesigned it and are now looking for feedback from some real users who are motivated to use the functionality of our app.<p>to that end, we have been following few related blogs and adding genuine comments to posts and in the process mentioning our app with url to get some traffic. we put a link to the app in our signature while posting our comments as well. we get some traffic from those efforts.<p>are there better ways to reach a targeted audience? the ideal scenario would be for them to give us feedback also about the app besides using it. how do we find such "real" users?<p>any advice on how to go about this? 2010-11-05 17:28:43 UTC

5813702 ask hn: need advice for a friend who's just starting out hi everyone!<p>i have a fairly smart friend. he's not a programmer - he dabbled in it in high school, thought it was kinda cool, but didn't think of it as a future career. having spent a good few years in other jobs (manual / small managerial) he's now quite keen on the idea of writing code for a living  :-)
he's now in a position where he can allow himself some 4-5 months of uninterrupted studying. that's a reasonable amount of time to learn something, but far from enough to get to a graduate level. 
he asked me something along the lines of, "what do i need to learn to get a job, and what can i learn on the job?"
thing is, i'm a fairly junior java developer in a huge corporation. in a way such a company would be great - they are fairly tolerant towards juniors and give them time to learn. but they won't even look in your direction without a cs diploma and/or relevant experience.<p>i wonder if some startups/smaller companies would be willing to take on a junior developer (@junior salary), and if so, what deliverables would he have to show to get through the door? e.g. an end-to-end ror|django app on github?<p>otherwise, perhaps with some knowledge of m$ technologies he could get a job doing business reports or something similar. his degree was in business management, so that might help a little.<p>(he's in london, by the way).<p>so, fellow hn'ers, what advice would you give? all opinions welcome! 
thanks! 2013-06-03 15:09:02 UTC

134224 ask yc: how to create enough content for launch? how does one go about creating content on a site to  have a public launch of a site that would interest others to stick around and contribute? (ie - if you were building a site for customer reviews of companies in a certain industry) 2008-03-11 14:17:33 UTC
10023871 ask hn: how does your support/sales/management inspect production db data? when you build a new product, there rarely is time to build rich internal websites to query production data and, in my experience, teams always resort to making scripts for the non-development part of the team, which are horrible to support (changes are hard to sync throughout the team, not everyone uses the terminal and so on) or they will hack some basic ui, which takes a significant amount of time and gets thrown away once there is a budget for something permanent.<p>i build an app called pagehop (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;pagehopapp.com) and i&#x27;m trying to figure out the demand of something i want to add, to remove the pain of the above-mentioned problem. pagehop is a launcher app you install on your computer, you open it up with a globally assigned key shortcut, you write a query and it displays results and a preview.<p>i want to build team support, which will make it easy to sync scripts (plugins) within a company.<p>use-case:<p>* you are a startup of 10 people;
 * virtually everyone needs to be able to inspect data from the&#x2f;a production db.<p>if you use pagehop, you can build a plugin to search your db. team support will allow you to upload the plugin in your team account and it will be synced to all of your teammates. whenever you need to change the plugin, you just upload the new version to the team account and the rest of your team will instantly get it.<p>what you get, using this:<p>* people writing tools for db (and any web) queries for support&#x2f;sales&#x2f;management will be able to push instantly their work to everyone in the team;
 * everyone will have a ui for looking at db data;
 * you will not spend resources building internal websites to-be-thrown-away;
 * no need to train people to use the terminal.<p>pricing:<p>* i&#x27;m currently thinking of charging $10 &#x2f; month (per seat);
 * there will be an annual deal discount (-1 month fee) and an additional discount for teams that show interest now.<p>thanks for your time and feedback. 2015-08-07 17:53:51 UTC

1750749 ask hn: how to scale a development team? my company's development team is about 50 strong, we've grown organically over the past 10 years, and overcome some growing pains during that time.<p>we're at a stage where, before further expansion, we can review our structure. i'd like to get some feedback from hn on how best to arrange a fast growing development team.<p>i have seen 3 patterns practiced each with their own strengths and weaknesses. i'm sure there are plenty more.<p>* superman. each sub team has an individual who acts as project manager/line manager/tech lead. this works very well in a small sub team (maybe 4 strong), working in a relatively small dev groups (maybe 20), but is difficult to scale.<p>* double act. have two roles in each sub team, a project/line manager and a dedicated tech lead. this relieves pressure on the individuals in question and works better in larger sub teams (say 8 strong) in larger dev groups (say 40). good for feedback and direction, but can be hard to restructure sub teams without significant discontinuity to team members.<p>* program manager. have a dedicated program manager take care of the project side, let the sub team handle their own technical leadership in an adhoc fashion and have a more distant development manager responsible for overall tech direction and line management of a number of sub teams. good for structural flexibility and cross sub team continuity but the distance of the dev manager means sub team problems can take longer to be spotted and resolved.<p>what are your experiences and what have you seen work best?<p>many thanks<p>neil 2010-10-02 16:31:15 UTC

5163860 ask hn: does bitcoin mining pay off? i'm curious whether there are people who do (semi-)professional bitcoin mining, for example with hardware like https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/mining_hardware_comparison, and whether this really pays off?<p>in the worst case, the costs for powering these devices is higher than the value of bitcoins mined, plus there is the risk of dropping exchange rates.<p>if it is somewhat profitable though, then i'm wondering why not more people are doing it, as it seems easy enough? if more people did it, would there be a risk of cannibalizing each others efforts? it might sound like naive questions as i don't know much about the mechanisms of bitcoins. 2013-02-04 13:07:25 UTC

1502616 ask hn: should i move? if so, where?   [throwaway account]<p>i'm indian. i've been pursuing the dream of finding a great job and a good life. i've considered myself a hacker of sorts, but most of what i do is simply to satisfy my own personal desires - tiny rails webapps, cool js animations whenever i feel like proving to someone that you don't need flash, and blinding desire to have the cleanest code :) i'd love to have a startup someday, and i spend hours reading and thinking obsessively about what kind of business i'd like to run, what kind of experience a user should be presented with, etc.<p>so i'm doing what i consider a decent, normal plan. i'm current on an l1 visa in the bay area, and i'll look for a job that'll give me an h1. i'm getting married soon, and will bring the wife back here. all's well-ish.<p>but the us is scaring the pants off me. on a daily basis i read about how the government is going more into debt, about rabid tea-party fans, internet kill-switches, racism, police brutality, california's financial misery. it's enough to make me reconsider moving back to india, but i'd really like to work with some of the companies i admire so much.<p>so i have 2 questions - 
1. am i simply being paranoid? is it just because i read too much reddit, etc that i feel this way and i just need to relax? is it worth paying so much to rent in the bay area, and stuff will work itself out?<p>2. if i had to move somewhere, where should i go to? how easy is it to find a great web developer job in europe/australia/nz/wherever? a place that'll ideally help me migrate, and would be a good place to raise  family?<p>i'd love pointers, discussions, anything. thanks hn. 2010-07-09 23:47:09 UTC

2. editing page content should be as simple as changing text in markdown, i dont want to be editing html. static generators is probably what i want.
3. should look nice -- lots of templating options. im not a designer, so dont want to spend too much time working with css.
4. multi-page, not a big fan of the &quot;one page&quot; multi-link layout.
5. responsive -- should work well on mobiles and tables. 2014-06-06 16:57:17 UTC

3522702 ask hn: faking it until you make it? hello hn. i've got an interesting idea for a side project, but i'm a front end guy with zero programming knowledge. i see neat side projects frequently on hn, and of course they're almost always fully self coded from the ground up and created with something like app engine or heroku.<p>i could easily start my idea out on something like tumblr or wordpress.com, but my question is: is it possible to still be taken legitimately as a site/service if my idea was to use one of those? or would i be laughed off of the internet/hn for appearing amateur? at some point when i'm able to pay a freelancer, i'd want to have the site built from scratch and self hosted - but i don't have that option at the current time.<p>i've heard that groupon started out on wordpress, but i'm sure they still had large amounts of custom plugin development. are there any other startups that started this way? 2012-01-28 18:05:27 UTC

6142978 should i go to college or keep working in silicon valley? i&#x27;m working at a startup as a rails developer. i was hired straight out of high school, which meant being underpaid, though i&#x27;ve spent my time improving my skills. long story short, the job market in silicon valley is really hot - i now have 2 outside offers in the $110-120k range (0-0.5% equity) at early to late-stage startups, and i might be able to bid the offers up to the 130k+ range. at the same time, i&#x27;m thinking about going back to college - a non-ivy but top cs school (think carnegie mellon, uc berkeley, uiuc).<p>one thought i have is that we&#x27;re possibly at the high point of the current tech boom and that i should take a job while the market is hot, then go back to school when there&#x27;s a cooldown. there&#x27;s also the fact that as a fresh cs grad, 4 years down the line, i would be making roughly the same, or maybe just slightly more, as i could make right now (100-120k).<p>but i wonder whether going back to school after being in the industry for 2-3 years will even make sense.<p>ultimately, i don&#x27;t know how to weigh the social and educational experience of college against starting my career 4 years early. i&#x27;m not particularly concerned that a lack of a degree itself will hold me back in the future. any thoughts?<p>update: no college debt, parents thankfully have enough to pay for it. 2013-08-01 19:47:39 UTC

1601545 lost interest in programming i currently have a job with a big company with a decent income. i do my job pretty well, but it is clear that i lack initiative and could be more proactive. i can implement and build things fast, solve complex bugs and problems, but all i want is to get it done - i don't do anything extra to make it better, or find out if what i am asked to do makes any real difference, or find new things i could work on to make an impact.<p>over the years i have sort of lost interest in technology. i know enough to do my job well, read hn and news and stuff, but that's about it. i don't try out new things. i have an attitude that it is mostly just the same 1s and 0s that i can figure out if i really want to.<p>i am actually going to join a startup for a lot less pay soon, but i am just joining for the experience, hoping a change of environment might help with my general apathy. i am not sure though.<p>anyone else has this feeling, and how did you resolve it? 2010-08-13 17:30:59 UTC

2048874 ask hn: marketing and pricing advice for self-published ebook 	if you were writing a technology centric ebook, would you publish it free online and sell a digital ebook (pdf/epub/etc.) and print on demand version, or just have it for sell with a free sample chapter like most traditional publishers? i'm noticing many online ebooks that are available fully free online but with for pay extras, http://railstutorial.org being a good example. the free content would obviously be a great way for people to discover your writing, but also lowers the likelihood of them paying. then again, a for-pay ebook that no one knows of won't get sold either. most of all, there's no reason we need to stick with only the most traditional sales methods with ebooks.
what's your feelings about each method, and which would you choose? i've almost decided what i want to do, but would be interested to see the general thoughts on both models<p>note: this is a repost of http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2042898, as the original post didn't get any response. 2010-12-29 15:23:26 UTC

70062 yc rejection emails are out! "we're sorry to say we couldn't accept your proposal for funding.
please don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we
rejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the
quality of the applicants.  for example, we were very reluctant to
accept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting
a startup is too much work for one person.  we also had a higher
threshold for applicants who were still in school, groups where one
or more members planned to keep their current jobs, and groups that
couldn't all move to california.  we rejected a lot of proposals simply
because we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem
domain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too
big to start on only three months of funding.  sometimes we even
rejected good ideas, because another group proposed the same idea
and seemed further along.<p>we realize this process is fraught with error. it's practically
certain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful
startups.  if you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email
telling us about it; we want to learn from our mistakes.<p>thanks,<p>y combinator staff" 2007-10-19 01:05:09 UTC

7074264 ask hn: how do you deal with potential acquirers? how do you respond to someone who says they are interested in acquiring your business (especially a potential competitor) but won&#x27;t make an offer until you share your financals and other confidential data? do you ask them to make an offer without seeing the books first or share your data, hoping they make an offer, but realizing you&#x27;re sharing confidential info? and how do you differentiate serious offers from time wasters who will chew all your time only to either not offer or low-ball after seeing your financial state? can you get away with saying: &quot;i&#x27;m not sharing you anything until you make an offer?&quot; but then how can you obligate them to that?<p>and what if they are adamant that they won&#x27;t make an offer until they see your books and do due diligence? i would think that if investors can make a term sheet commitment contingent on due diligence, so can you do that with potential acquirers. but they don&#x27;t seem to see it that way?<p>here&#x27;s some suggestions we&#x27;ve gotten, but i don&#x27;t know what is common place or accepted:<p>* tell potential acquirers that they must first submit a contingent offer providing your books substantiate certain minimum metrics.<p>* tell potential acquirers that they have to pay for your time in doing due diligence, setting a flat rate (say, $20k for sake of argument), with the amount counting as a non-refundable deposit towards the acquisition amount<p>* use a trusted third party to do a due diligence review, providing your information to the third-party who will not disclose it to the acquirer, but only verify certain required facts or due diligence requests. the trusted third party inspects the books and doesn&#x27;t disclose them to the acquirer but knows their desired metrics.<p>* breakup fee that penalizes them for walking away.<p>* confidentiality agreement with huge damages for disclosing any of the information outside a small group of people in the acquiring company. 2014-01-17 04:15:05 UTC

486755 ask hn: just cashed out for 2m. what now? i'm posting this from an anonymous account, for obvious reasons. i just sold my company and have 2 million dollars in the bank. what now? i basically have nobody to consult. it's a business i bought for 90k that just kind of swelled up really fast, and i'm really not set up to manage this kind of money. i'm canadian, the economy seems to be going to hell down south and i'm sure it's gonna hit here soon and i have no idea who to take advice from.<p>my bank is trying to get me to put all my money into money market mutual funds while i wait, my accountant tells me i should diversify, get some cashable gics while i wait, and start looking into stocks, as well as investing in insurance companies since they usually guarantee your investment (so long as they don't go bankrupt). i used to just put all my money into a high interest savings account at ing and collect the 3% (which is good enough for me to live on at this point).<p>any advice to offer? any good reading (canadian-specific would be good)? any good software for mac to manage all this? :) 2009-02-19 04:48:59 UTC

7872239 tell hn: the site was offline. what changed? obviously things took longer than intended and expected, but in the end:<p>items moved from &#x2f;12345 to &#x2f;12&#x2f;34&#x2f;12345. hn now starts in one fifth the time, and better utilizes the filesystem cache. backup speeds are also improved.<p>profiles moved from &#x2f;kogir to &#x2f;ko&#x2f;gi&#x2f;kogir, and from &#x2f;kogir to &#x2f;%k&#x2f;og&#x2f;%kog%ir, which works on case-insensitive filesystems. similar performance improvements were observed.<p>passwords moved from a 45mb user-&gt;hash mapping file into user profiles themselves. previously, this mapping file was re-written in its entirety every time a new account was created, and is why the site went down on may 18th. new account creation is now incredibly lightweight, and should allow us to further limit and possibly eliminate our use of captchas.<p>there were additional changes to support new features currently in the pipeline, but which we&#x27;re not yet ready to announce.<p>i&#x27;m sorry that we were offline for so long. nothing else we currently have planned should require anything more than a simple restart, so with any luck this will be the last major disruption the quarter, and maybe even this year. 2014-06-10 13:14:53 UTC

4667856 slicing pie: a guide to dividing up early-stage startup equity not long ago, i was approached by one of my students at northwestern, who was distraught over a situation in a fledging company that she had started in my entrepreneurship class. her group had decided to split the equity in her company equally – 25 percent each. now that the class was over, the other three partners weren’t pulling their weight. two of them were pretty much out of the picture, and the third was only doing a little. however, all of them wanted to keep their share of the equity or sell it at an unreasonable price. the student was on the edge of tears. she didn’t know what to do. she found herself a minority shareholder in a company that she had dreamed about starting for several years. now it seemed that the idea was going to die on the vine.<p>i wish this was the only time i’d heard this story, but it’s not. it happens all the time.<p>in spite of an overwhelming number of books offering advice to entrepreneurs, there are surprisingly few about how to properly divide up the startup equity pie to avoid situations like my students’. the last time i counted, the number was zero. so i wrote one, called slicing pie, which as far as i know is the only book on the subject that exists.<p>because there have been no good resources, many entrepreneurs make the mistake of calling a lawyer or an accountant to help them solve the problem. these people aren’t free, and the money spent is money that could have otherwise been used for marketing, product development, or anything else that helps a company grow. lawyers and accountants (as much as i love them) don’t really help young companies grow. 2012-10-18 08:01:08 UTC

2780868 microsoft struggles to get hyper-v drivers in linux kernel it was recently reported that microsoft is now one of the top corporate contributors to the linux kernel. but the reason for redmond's recent flurry of contributions lies in the fact that its two-year-old project to get hyper-v drivers into the linux kernel has taken longer than expected. the drivers are still in the kernel staging tree, and microsoft has to finish the items on a to-do list before hyper-v drivers can move out of the staging area. when asked why it's taken so long, linux project leader greg kroah-hartman says the issue was simply that "changes were not being submitted that frequently." 2011-07-19 13:49:04 UTC

2655823 to target techies or non-techies okay guys, after studying ux design and steve blank's customer manifesto back and forth, i have decided to create a mobile web survey tool.<p>i was quite amped about its benefits until i received feedback from potential customers during the customer development phase:
1. non-tech/marketer people - "uhh.. how is this going to make me more money?"
2. tech/marketer people - "thanks for the idea, we'll probably get out mobile web developer to add it to our upcoming app"<p>so being a tech person, would you find utility in using a third party mobile web/native-app saas that could be added onto your primary app?<p>scenario - you are creating a mobile app for an events company. they ask you to add a feedback feature with mcq's, scale q's and longform text input. would you:
(a) create the whole damn thing yourself
(b) save yourself 30+ hours in development time and plugin the saas feedback tool?<p>cheers,

7978087 ask hn: how did you start writing? i&#x27;m relatively new to social media publishing and monitoring (late to the party) but i&#x27;m trying to learn. i published one article that got up to 3k views, but that was about it. now i&#x27;m reaching out to the hacker news community.<p>why do you write? personal or business? or was it just fun on sm that turned serious? where is the line?<p>how do you write? personal website or blogging site? what about linkedin publishing? or medium?<p>how do you choose topics? i&#x27;m trying to put out information that is useful to a target audience, but i&#x27;m not sure how. not a lot of people write comments for the volume of readers i&#x27;m reaching.<p>how do you promote? i use linkedin and buffer for twitter and facebook, but without a lot of success. very few retweets and&#x2f;or even clicks.<p>how do you change? i&#x27;m using buffer for analytics, but it&#x27;s hard to analyze nothing. in the limited feedback i do receive, i don&#x27;t know what to look for. what does a favorited tweet mean? nothing? something? do i use a 5-1-1 approach to original vs. shared content or another?<p>help! i need some direction. i don&#x27;t want to become one of the people who posts once, then says, &quot;social media is hard&quot; and gives up. 2014-07-02 17:01:06 UTC

10370617 is doing an ms in cs after an ms in applied math a waste of time? i am a graduate student at one of the canadian universities, and i will graduate with a masters degree in applied math this coming december (my gpa is ~3.9&#x2f;4.0). i am aiming towards getting a job in industry instead.
i decided to do a second master’s degree starting fall 2016 in a different field where i can learn useful skills that i can use to get me a job in industry (i am more interested in canada, but i don’t mind to go to the us as well).<p>my questions are the following:<p>1. for those of you who are in computer science&#x2f;engineering: what major do you recommend i should switch to in order to learn extra useful and applied skills that will increase my chances to land a good job in industry (and also where i will be using and benefiting from my math background)?<p>2. is computer science (machine learning&#x2f;data mining) the best option to switch to (in your opinion) for someone with a strong math background?<p>3. do you know other areas within computer science that have promising job opportunities and where i can apply my math background?<p>4. do you recommend i should get a bachelor’s degree (which will last only two years because there are many canadian universities that offer bachelor’s degrees in computer science as a second degree) in computer science instead of master’s degree? i heard that employers like to hire people with bachelors only because they don’t have to pay them much (among other reasons), unlike the people with masters who are regarded as overqualified by many employers<p>5. are you aware of any good master’s programs in canada in computer science&#x2f;engineering that you recommend i should apply to for fall 2016? please tell me the name of the program and what specialization&#x2f;research group you recommend i should get in touch with (i am interested in doing my masters in canada only because i am a permanent resident of canada and i want to stay in canada for at least the next two-three years). 2015-10-11 19:39:17 UTC

3068003 practical trade secret tips? other than the score of legal agreements (ndas, work for hire, security policies, background checks) and physical/data security (restricted access, encryption, etc.), what are some practical ways to deal with running a startup while maintaining trade secrets?<p>for instance, i can make sure that only developers who absolutely need access to certain data for their work have such access, but are more "clever" methods often employed, such as somehow splitting up crucial algorithms (if possible) and data so that only partial information is available to any individual or group? something akin to the security that highly anticipated movie productions use to protect scripts or stories before they are released as movies by splitting the scripts into sections and restricting access?<p>how does a company like google deal with access to its page-rank algorithm? do certain high-level developers and managers get access to the algorithm completely, or is it more convoluted than that? or are the legal agreements enough to maintain the necessary secrecy?<p>i'm at the beginning of a startup that will depend on trade secrets for some algorithmic stuff and i'm curious what other companies have implemented practically to deal with this. 2011-10-03 20:53:40 UTC

8813523 factory equipment investing as an alternative to real-estate investing? [ask hn] i understand that many people find real-estate investing appealing for several reasons, including the fact that real-estate appreciates in value, generates a recurring income stream, and has preferential tax treatment.<p>i see the appeal, but i feel that (like stock market investing), real-estate investing is ethically neutral.  if possible, it would be nice to be able to have the money accomplish something socially beneficial, something more than just making a return.<p>i was thinking, what if instead of real-estate investing, what if tech people like us were to invest in factory equipment?  e.g. pick &amp; place machines, reflow soldering machines, 3d printers, cncs, dna synthesis machines, etc.  just like buying a house and renting it out to tenants, one could buy a (probably used) machine that is on the market at a favorable price, mod &#x2f; upgrade it to increase its value, and then rent it out to anyone who wants to start or expand a factory but doesn&#x27;t have a lot of capital.<p>if a lot of us do this, it could make it easier for people in the west to start and expand factories, and ultimately expand the domestic manufacturing industry &#x2f; maker movement.<p>it seems like main difference would be that equipment (unlike real-estate) would naturally tend to decrease in value over time, but i propose that this could be counteracted by (1) avoiding equipment that is extremely quickly obsoleted such as bitcoin-mining rigs and (2) by keeping the equipment in good repair and upgrading it over time with aftermarket modifications.<p>any thoughts on whether this approach would be feasible as a way to turn small-scale investment income into monthly recurring revenue?<p>cheers and happy holidays! 2014-12-30 05:57:03 UTC

5053870 suggest to hn: a website to highlight unjust/immoral laws in light of recent events, unjust laws and relative morality, i have an idea for a website basically called 'felonies i've committed.'<p>the site is anonymous, (e.g. no social logins), with a linked .onion copy available for the very cautious.<p>the page shows a number of simple questions like 'have you ever downloaded a movie from a friend or torrent site', 'accidentally or knowingly taken marijuana over the canadian border,' etc., with inclusion of the number of times or volume when applicable. the questions are written to be easily understandable and with the loosest reasonable interpretation possible.<p>on submission you get a report saying something like "based on your answers you could be charged with 80 years in jail and/or 100k in fines." the report would itemize the charges based on answers and include links to the federal laws and the ability to comment on each question/law.<p>this is purely as an exercise to show people how ridiculous many laws are, <i>demonstrate the gravity</i> of breaking them and create some dialog. 2013-01-14 08:56:10 UTC

1720970 we need to be prepared for the next disaster. ever since katrina, and more recently the bp oil spill, i've been saying that we need to have a public non-profit organization with experts ready to be called on, resources ready to use, etc. and this organization should be funded ahead of time, with a public meter of how much $ is in the fund and statistics for how much it cost to clean up disasters in years prior. it should have knowledge of previous disasters and list the experts that were involved in those. etc.<p>this should be public information. data.gov is a great initiative, but we need a global preparedness fund. it doesn't have to be a government program. it takes several dedicated hackers to make a website.<p>i got reminded of it when reading this, and remembering how bp stood by while people who spent 15 years on this thing, tried to help:<p>http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/usoilpollutionenvironmentpeoplecostner<p>when disasters happen, we should all pull together, not wait for someone like bp and wonder "whose ass to kick". 2010-09-23 19:30:26 UTC

190475 ask yc: new twitter utility? this morning i was thinking about how i like to use twitter primarily as a way to keep my finger on the pulse of different sectors of the world. twitter is great since you get ground-level real time knowledge from people in the know, but you already knew that.<p>twitter makes it hard to manage your stream though, so i am proposing a site called "twitchboard" think of it as alltop for twitter. 
twitchboard would identify (by hand to some extent) the top 100 or so quality twitter mavens in any one of several categories and allow you to see the steam from that category.<p>-politics 
-technology 
-arts and entertainment
-business
-regional interests<p>i've run into a ton of great twitters in all those areas, but it's not something i'd want filling up my entire feed all the time, it would be a lot more useful i you could go "hmm, lets listen to what people in and around the world of politics are saying today" and boom* you can check it out before rolling over and seeing what the most active sports people are talking about.<p>what do you guys think? is there something like this out there? would it be handy? 2008-05-15 13:47:51 UTC

6315008 ask hn: what do you do if your parents keep asking for money so quick explanation, i&#x27;m a relatively young engineer, i&#x27;m also single and have moved up quickly (positionally and in salary) career-wise and my parents have been around to notice. at a certain point, i started making more than my parents. when that happened, my father asked for some financial support claiming that he was barely making ends meet (which had happened in the past when i was younger). he wanted me to send him $1000 monthly for what he initially said would just be 8 months. however, i kept making more money and he kept asking for the $1000 every month (the last tally i have is around 32 months). this went on to a point where they also asked for a house and really pressured me into buying one. at the end of the year, it ends up being a good sum of money that i give to then entirely tax-free on their end.<p>about a year ago, i left to go work on a startup as a cofounder. we bootstrapped the whole thing so there was no income other than money i had saved up so i stopped sending my parents the money and they understandably stopped asking for it. the company i bootstrapped didn&#x27;t work out so i&#x27;m again jumping back into the workforce and getting paid around what i was previously making and my parents are once again asking for money saying that they really need it (father works btw).<p>i know i&#x27;m well payed but i work very hard at what i do; but then again, its my parents that i&#x27;m helping and after all, i&#x27;m single and have no other obligations to take care of than myself. i&#x27;d feel extremely guilty if i didn&#x27;t send them money and just kept it for myself. so my question is, has anyone else been in a similar situation and if so how did you handle it? what should i do? 2013-09-02 13:23:07 UTC

4155786 chrome and misleading security information if you use a self-signed certificate to secure a website, google chrome's reaction is somewhat dramatic and i would say inaccurate and misleading. below is a screenshot (sorry, you'll have to accept the certificate to view it!):<p>https://puntoshare.com/resource/bvihzpsc<p>the google chrome url bar with the "https" and "padlock" icons crossed out with a bold red line would suggest to the user that the page is not encrypted, does not use https and is 'not safe'.<p>of course, this is not true and the chrome 'site information' text clearly states that the site is secured with 256-bit encryption (and displays a reassuring green padlock icon). however, i am sure very few users actually view the 'site information' text.<p>i agree that the certificate does not verify the identity of the site, but this is a separate issue, right? i just want to ensure the user that information passed to/from the server is encrypted.<p>we visit unsecured websites all the time and we have no idea how safe they are or who owns them and browsers give us absolutely no warnings, so i am a bit disappointed that when i do attempt to increase security for the end-user the browser works against me, implying the site is unsafe.<p>can't google bypass the ca's and implement their own site authentication mechanism (for free)? 2012-06-25 09:41:46 UTC

5461394 where is good journalism about cyprus i'm fairly interested in what's going on in cyprus at the minute. one thing that stands out to me is how much of the reporting is in slogans, metaphor &#38; cliches. i realize (and accept) that for the general headline browsing public articles need to be made up of sentences that can be understood without context.<p>all the articles are told as stories but this story would be better told in numbers.<p>why isn't there an article anywhere with tables &#38; number for those people (like me) who are willing to take 30 minutes or an hour (or more) to understand it. when they say "<i>cypriot banks’ high exposure to bad greek debt</i>" or "<i>without ecb emergency funds, the cypriot economy will collapse</i>" what exactly are the mechanics of those things.<p>presumably they borrowed (bonds) to invest in these greek bonds. who did they borrow from? how much? how much is in insured/uninsured accounts? what exactly does collapse mean?<p>a lot of europeans &#38; cypriots would be interested in reading this kind of journalism. it seems like it should exist. where is it? 2013-03-29 16:11:46 UTC

2016817 diary of a marketing pro: why you need me it’s no secret that every business, no matter how small, needs a voice. your company needs a face, an image and a following—and that’s where i come in.<p>i’ll start off by telling you a little bit about myself. i am a 2009 graduate of tufts university currently working as a marketing and community relations professional in chicago. i am also an independent style writer, maintaining two blogs. i am looking to relocate to the san francisco bay area and get some experience in a smaller company environment—a climate i know i will thrive in. i am a highly creative individual by nature and training. between a ba in art history and various passions (including photography, business, archaeology, web design, sailing, and traveling to name a few) my brain is constantly concocting, conceptualizing and pursuing innovative ideas.<p>i currently work for a mid-sized organization and have witnessed first hand the profound effect an individual can have on a company. the process of taking a great idea from being hardly noticed to being monumental can simply start with one driven person. before starting my current position, my department coordinated a great deal of community events that saw little return. along with my team, i decided to reevaluate the way in which the organization ran promotions and programs, reducing the volume, and instead focusing on creative and meaningful community interactions. this has resulted in a significant increase in guest attendance, interest and participation at events.<p>i want to take the skills i have learned in chicago and apply them in a smaller company environment. i have the originality, teamwork skills and results-driven determination to help make great ideas stand out among the rest.<p>so, to all you san francisco companies out there--let's talk more. please feel free to e-mail me at christina3996@gmail.com. i'd love to hear from you!<p>thanks,

391722 idea - shopping for visual goods i wanted to brainstorm this idea with fellow yc members. 
problem: i need to buy some furniture for a room but i'm visually impaired (i.e. i lack good taste) so after seeing some furniture at crate and barrel, i went online to see some unique ways some of this furniture is being used in the <i>real</i> world. i did some searches on google &#38; flickr and found some cool pictures of rooms but i'm not sure where the items are from. my life would be easier if there was a service that would tag user created photos with product links. my question to you: 1.) how would build this service? tech? 2.) is there a real business somewhere here in this problem? 2008-12-09 20:32:23 UTC

89477 ask yc: thoughts on iphone mobile office market my startup, itenna, is working on mobile document management for the iphone.<p>specifically, we are solving 2 problems:
1. enabling access and editing of ms docs on the iphone / web
2. providing wireless bi-directional sync across iphone, computer, web (bye, bye to versioning hell, cables and missing docs)<p>our target market is sales and mobile professionals that need synced docs on the go.<p>we subscribe to ma's product/market fit and would like feedback on the market part of that equation (if itenna "just works", then the product part should solve itself).<p>based on our research, a large segment of early iphone buyers had used palm treos (which has a mobile office app, not wireless bi-directional syncing though).<p>is our target market ripe for such an app/service?  are we solving a real problem?<p>thanks in advance.<p>(btw, if you want to help test, email me at beta at itenna dot net) 2007-12-14 09:30:16 UTC

5903488 show hn: opensource webapp that aims to teach beginners to code i&#x27;ve been working on this prototype for a bit of a website that tries to get beginners interested in coding.<p>i learned to program on a ti calculator by making ascii games using ti-basic&#x27;s draw text function. with this webapp i tried to recreate that kind of simplistic exploratory programming that i enjoyed.<p>also i wanted to maybe get kind of a demoscene feel where beginners would try to create cool stuff right away and then share them with the world.<p>the basic idea is that it lets users write javascript programs that interact with a matrix of grids. by setting the color of each grid you can make graphical apps kind of like screensavers. then you can save your program and share it with other people and other people can &#x27;remix&#x27; or modify your program.<p>it&#x27;s at an early but playable state now so i would love to get some feedback from the community on the direction this is going. also its open sourced on github so i would also love anyone with ideas for improvements to contribute.<p>the url is http:&#x2f;&#x2f;grids.cavecode.com<p>thanks! 2013-06-19 02:57:07 UTC

having such a library and incorporating in standard c,c++ or perl programs will save the money yet will be a good bargain.<p>suggestions...<p>thank you 2008-10-12 09:06:25 UTC

3540554 tips for telling your boss about your side project a year or two ago i had a good idea for a small startup in the same industry as my day job. i told my boss about the idea but we just haven't had the resources to execute it -- we have a ton of stuff pending on our existing projects. so, i've been working on it at home at night and on the weekends, and it's been pretty exciting so far.<p>i'd like my bosses support (at least some degree of it) and i want to be honest with him about the project. i don't intend to quit. since our company does some investments in other companies, my ideal scenario would be if he gives me company resources to further develop it, in exchange for some equity.<p>has anyone been in this situation before? what would be the best way to tell him about my project? what should i avoid saying? 2012-02-01 23:11:01 UTC

1840015 ask hn: how important is it to be an expert in something? when i read job postings for the latest hot tech startup, or read profiles of big name programmers working at these startups, it seems like being an expert at something is a necessity to make it (and in some cases, an expert at multiple things).<p>i've been programming professionally for a few 
years now, and i don't feel like an expert at anything. i don't know if it's because of the environment i'm in or that my "expertise" thinly  spread across coding what i code and the industry/domain i'm in.<p>i guess i'm sort of a jack-of-many-trades, but truly an expert at none. i know startups often say they need generalists, but it also seems like a startup needs people that are really, really good at many things to get a startup off the ground.<p>should i be spending my weekends consciously trying to become an expert at something, even if it's not something i'm going to use/reinforce in my daily work? or is depth overrated compared to breadth? 2010-10-27 19:08:02 UTC

it is a high end consumer product.  this market actually needs a sales team to guide customers through the purchase.  people are not comfortable buying such a high end item online without speaking to a real person.  i have a sales team in this industry that will guide the sales.<p>there is no company doing it for this market yet.  spreadshirts = t-shirts. etsy = cheap handmade items. ponoko = design bracelets and cheapish chachkas.  shapeways = design 3d objects.<p>so think of it as spreadshirts for a high end industry.  go on, give it to me over the head for not stating the industry, that is what makes hn exciting.  i am waiting for it, :-).<p>contact me if you are interested agrinshtein [at] the big g. if you cant figure out what that is, i don't want you. 2009-06-17 21:50:10 UTC

4376527 ask hn: should i employ tdd as a rails beginner? i've seen a lot of discussion about why tdd is good, and why some people feel that it's unnecessary in many circumstances. my understanding is that if you are writing a large scale application that will involve thousands of lines of code and will need maintenance for years, then yes, tdd is certainly a good way to go.<p>my question, though, is will tdd help me as a beginner to rails when i am simply trying to get the core concepts and write small apps that get more experience under my belt. my intuition is that tdd is extraneous at this point and slows down the instant gratification factor that motivates me to do more and learn quicker. what are your experiences with it and did it abet your learning process? 2012-08-13 16:07:06 UTC
7744310 ask hn: does app store support non-store based paid users dear fellow hners, we are getting into enterprise app soon. it could have different subscription channel for payments - web, actual offline sales (bank cheques), another app store like google play.&lt;p&gt;can there be a model where users pay via &#x27;web only&#x27; and are served through ios and android apps. 
- is this possible
- are there any examples of such apps
- have&#x2f;can store take any objections to this model.&lt;p&gt;thanks in advance. 2014-05-14 15:35:49 UTC

3504767 dutch court rejects apple appeal, says samsung galaxy tab 10.1 is legal a court in the hague has just cleared the samsung galaxy tab 10.1 for sale in the netherlands, rejecting apple's requests for a nationwide ban. as nu.nl reports, a different dutch court had already issued a similar ruling in october, which cupertino promptly appealed, claiming that sammy's slate was too similar to its own ipad 2. today, though, the court of the hague shot down apple's arguments, determining that there are enough differences between the two products to legally justify their coexistence. granted, this is only one of many patent battles that the two companies are currently waging, but for today, at least, it looks like samsung has come out on top. 2012-01-24 14:13:01 UTC

8713243 ask hn: go beyond the programming aspects of my app securing/funding? the other day i had a great idea, its no where to be found on the markets ios or android. so the other day i built it as a weekend hack i think that this app has great potential... i am young but wondering what the best way togo about raising money while preventing others from stealing the idea. are trademarkets&#x2f;copyright&#x2f;patents needed to  secure the idea? any advice beyond programming the app is welcome... however i am mostly interested in finding out how to go about funding the idea. i would just need small amount of funding to try and scale this idea for x amount of months to test it and see how the public would use it, and if its something that would last long term...
thanks hn! 2014-12-07 19:26:11 UTC

2443685 who is paid for working on their passion project and whats it worth? during my first internship working on a niche b2b product i asked the senior developers if they envisioned themselves working on this project when they got their first job.<p>they answered that when they started work they had aspirations to be on projects that they were personally interested in or develop things that would have a profound effect on the public. 
then they went on to say that you get over it quickly, programming is programming and you only hope to get to solve interesting tech problems even if they are on boring products and ultimately the pay check is king.<p>this bugs me and even with my own side projects, i find losing 60 hours a week to something i am not passionate about disheartening.<p>my question is: what are you will to trade to get a job working on a project you like? 2011-04-13 19:11:44 UTC

1789013 unsearchable hi all,
    i am interested in investing my time in a new idea called the unsearchable. many of us would have faced problems in the past where the search in a google does not lead us to a solution. some people should have found their own way in solving the problem. so we do want to give credits to people who find solutions to problems which are unsearchable. this was my basic idea.<p>i would like to basically create a site where users can post a solution to a problem which could never be found over the internet. we maintain a credit base system for people who find the solution. credits are given if others like the solution and others may modify it and discuss about it in the comments. i don't know if something like this exists or not.<p>please help me get your views on it. i know its a dumb idea :d but i want to know the facts about how good it would be if its implemented. 2010-10-13 21:38:13 UTC

384351 ask yc: i am a blogger and got asked to do articles... haven't decided. i just started blogging a couple of months ago and i guess my content is good.  my current blog is spoiledtechie.com.  i was just recently asked to submit articles at www.dreamincode.net.  i don't think i want to do this.  i am not sure if i should take up the offer.<p>i started blogging for the sheer joy of getting better at my grammar and getting my name out there in the world.  i have been shooting for something great, but don't know where it could lead.  i am questioning whether i should do this or not.  it might get me some publicity, but other than that i don't know of anything else it could do for me. another thought is that spoiledtechie.com content will be there for ever as long as i pay for it.<p>the people at dnc will then be able to make money off my content forever...  do i want that?  they pay me what, like $100.00 or something per article, but over time, i would probably make that same amount of money over time for each article. i declined to blog at www.asp.net for the same reason.  i want to own my articles.<p>i have also heard that its the companies in the world that hold out and don't sell them selves cheap, that end up making a great product.  i think my blog is just like that.  i have a great product, but wonder if i wrote articles for dnc, would i actually get real publicity from it?  i want to be recognized some day down the road as a great programmer and thats why i mainly write to my blog.  so the question remains,<p>should i hold out?
should i go in for the publicity?<p>i am not a selfish person and wish to share with my community that has given me a lot in return.  i am just wondering how good of an idea is this?<p>should i or shouldn't i?<p>has anyone ever done this and regretted it? 2008-12-03 14:35:45 UTC

so for my career plan, i would like to find a kind of job/field (of course, related to computer science/engineering) that does not require much daily use of computer, but, for example, reading or writing.<p>one typical field comes to my mind is algorithm design, most of which can be done by scratching on papers. if i am wrong, please correct me. 2011-10-31 00:17:53 UTC

4340304 ask hn: review this startup idea this idea popped in my head during work today. i was hoping hn would a) tell me if this is viable and b) let me know if anyone is doing this right now.<p>i'm a business student going into my senior year of my undergrad degree. i'll be moving to silicon valley next year and after having internships all year for startups in ny i'd like to take a swing at things myself. i don't have a tech co-founder so i've been focusing on ideas that would not be insanely expensive to outsource, like the following idea.<p>i was thinking how my friends have a pretty difficult time shopping for their girl friends for anniversaries and special holidays like christmas. i also observed how my own girl friend gets really excited over random gifts i give her during circumstances when i'm not in trouble or when it's not a special occasion. yet guys don't really remember how little things can make their partners that much happier.<p>enter a new service. a paid, monthly subscription service where men signup and answer a questionnaire regarding their girlfriends/wives favorite things and tastes. a customer would receive one gift a month matching the inputted data. if he didn't like it he could send it back and not be charged for that month. the gift could even come wrapped for an additional fee. the mailing would include a non-descriptive return address so if their wife/girlfriend found the box it would just look like he purchased something off of amazon or another retailer.<p>during the beta phase i'd probably purchase from retailers based on the inputted preferences. and then eventually workout deals with wholesalers when i can purchase on a mass scale.<p>the key problem this startup would be solving is men's difficulty for shopping for their partners. it would allow men to avoid spending time shopping for random, "just because" gifts. and while they would still shop for their own personal christmas/anniversary gifts, this service would provide an additional gift for these occasions.<p>what do you think? 2012-08-05 01:47:57 UTC

4164573 ask hn: what are the problems you'd love to work on if you have time? here's my list:<p>1. we can find remembered points easily when reading because of centuries of development of layout and typography (headers, paragraphs, punctuation, spaces). what are the equivalent techniques for audio, video, and hypertext that would bring them to parity with printed text?<p>2. what is the easiest to acquire auxiliary language (i.e., esperanto, interlang, basic english) that we can build? can the barrier be made sufficiently low that the language would be adopted by linking it to some body of widely desired material where translation cost would probably exceed learning the language?<p>3. what would a symbolic model of a "well trained" mathematical mind look like, and can it be made precise enough for a computer to train a human mathematician? can we capture a large fraction of taste and intuition in this area?<p>4. what should a programming language meant for truly casual users (think a macro language for a word processor or a machine tool) look like? how do you make cutting and pasting code into a larger program trivial? what languages features save users from silent errors? what tools must the language support and have to make it explorable the way a gui is today, but make snippets shareable?<p>5. a clear exposition of biology from the ground up for technical readers, going through the thought processes and experimental results, and articulating the universal principles that arise, even if we can't state them mathematically yet (i've got lots of notes for this one).<p>6. how are statistical sublanguages carved off and adopted by fields? for example, statistics in biology hasn't really changed since fisher published statistical methods for research workers. six sigma is another sublanguage carved off for a certain segment of business users. what are the social and technical factors that let such a sublanguage survive separate from the ongoing study of statistics?<p>7. what is the abstract mathematical structure that arises from the study of centers as christopher alexander defines it in 'the nature of order'? it has something to do with equivalence classes of sublattices of the set of all subsets of space, where the equivalence relation is something like a homotopy but tied into basins that have strong coherence. what is the equivalence relation, and what are the mathematical properties of the structures that result?<p>at the moment these are the problems that i keep in my head, and file away anything that seems like it might help on any of them. what are yours? 2012-06-26 22:46:34 UTC

9308417 ask hn: how did you succeed to find a cofounder on websites like cofounderslab? i just signed up a few days ago and am trying to find someone who might be interested in starting his own business as a tech cofounder. but i find it&#x27;s hard to find potential people because most of them have a job right now and they&#x27;re waiting for an excellent chance. an excellent chance means few risks like no relocating, starting from part time, the right product, etc.<p>so i&#x27;m curious about your experience on the website and how you succeeded to find a cofounder there.<p>*i know founders should always prefer their friends and classmates. but i&#x27;m still curious who tried it and succeeded. 2015-04-02 02:58:59 UTC

3154488 a google interview question i recently interviewed with google for a product manager position. i wasn’t really looking since i have been actively working on my startup.  but since the google recruiter found me on linkedin and reached out to me, i went ahead and gave the whole interview process a shot.  overall, the process was professional and well organized.  i thought i answered most of the questions well except for this one:<p>for any given day, calculate the total number of miles traveled by all the passengers using the subway.<p>just want to share this! 2011-10-25 15:55:02 UTC
7847099 ask hn admins: please indicate charset (utf-8) inside your html dear hn admins:<p>would you please modify the web pages generated by hacker news so that they indicate the content type internally, especially the encoding?  in other words, would you please add the following tag:<p>&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text&#x2f;html; charset=utf-8&quot;&#x2f;&gt;<p>to your web pages&#x27; head section?<p>my personal interest in this is to improve the hourly hacker news snapshot (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;hhn.domador.net).  for a long time, the archived pages frequently included a few gibberish characters when loaded from a web browser.  (smart quotes were the kind of characters that were most often displayed improperly.)  i decided to finally get around to fixing this.  i&#x27;ve modified my web server so that it indicates the utf-8 charset in the http headers. (edited section)<p>there are probably others who would benefit from this change as well.  what do you think?<p>-----<p>(edit: i removed the following text, when i found out that cloudflare does pass along the content-type:<p>&quot;unfortunately, this solution is a bit limiting.  i can no longer use cloudflare to cache my website (since i can&#x27;t customize cloudflare to specify the content type).  i could reprocess and hack the old pages to add the content-type section, but i&#x27;d prefer to modify the content i download as little as possible.&quot;) 2014-06-04 18:01:06 UTC
4101845 ios really needs multi-user capabilities just watched the keynote.  the social integration is very interesting.  however, it now creates a situation for devices used by multiple people.  in our home, ipads and ipods are multi-user.  grab one and go.<p>that means that one of several people could be on any device at any time.  if i were to setup facebook through settings with my login information the integration will be broken for others.  it also opens up some negatives.  a seven year old can post to your fb account just as well as you can.<p>then there's the scenario of handing your idevice to someone else, say a house guest.  they have full access to everything on your device.<p>it goes beyond that.  everyone's browsing history will now pollute the browsing history on your mac.  everyone can edit documents and affect them on your mac. photos. etc.<p>ios6 is screaming for multi-user capabilities. 2012-06-12 18:09:35 UTC

3498229 ask hn: is "hacker news" misleading? this question was spurred by my thoughts on another thread (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3498000). as i continued writing my post to that thread, i realized my thoughts were increasingly leading me to a different topic.<p>i started reading hn last spring. as a newcomer, i had a hard time understanding exactly what hn was trying to be. when i came here, i was hoping to find more technical content (programming related) and less fluff than i was finding at reddit. this was preconception was largely due to the impression i got from boths friends who recommended hn and from hn's name itself. however, that's now what i found, which was disappointing. i found instead a variety of content that's more "steve jobs"-esque, meaning the content posted is often focused on the interface between the real world and technological world (as steve jobs would say, where liberal arts meets technology). this was very far from what i expected hn to be. i love hn for what it is, now that i know what it is, but i think "hacker news" is largely misleading/misrepresentative and attracts a different audience than what hn intends (or has become - i'm not sure).<p>for the most part, most tech content posted seems to be web-related (a somewhat fitting stereotype would be "ruby hackers"), or not actually technical at all (for example, from the frontpage now: http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/ideas-bank/nice-guys).<p>there is nothing "hacker" in nature in most of the content posted here. there's nothing wrong with that; the name is just misleading (in my opinion).<p>so i am wondering, does anyone agree with me? i may be totally off or have a strange interpretation of the word "hacker." either way, i'd like to know what you think! 2012-01-22 23:33:00 UTC
9832027 ask hn: career dilemma, what would you do? in the last year, i&#x27;ve joined a services consulting firm as a consultant for a specialised area in it. this job pays roughky $90k (package) in sf. however due to issues regarding relocation (immigration and so forth) i&#x27;ve been working remotely from another country. this has been difficult nonetheless, however the company has been supportive and have paid for all lawyers thus far.<p>last week, i was given an offer from a friend who heads this particular area of it in a pre-ipo company that has been considered a brilliant place to work and is one of the stable growing startups for over 5 years. the offer given to me was to not relocate and take a job leading a team in my expertise for a higher pay + equity.<p>i have worked with said company&#x27;s team in the past and have found it delightful.<p>i would like to ask hn, what would they do? i have a level of loyalty for said company in sf and love the team a lot there. immigration issues are soon to clear up if all goes well.<p>personally i had decided to leave sf company by the end of this month if such immigration issues do not resolve and take this offer.<p>otherwise, i plan to continue with this company even though the pay will be significantly less and work significantly more stressful.<p>said company in sf have been cutting costs and do not evaluate salaries more than once a year. even after staying a year, i feel like my salary will only increase by $5-10k.<p>thanks all 2015-07-05 00:11:53 UTC

5898455 ask hn: what's next? hey,<p>a couple of months ago, i created a new bookmarking service (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;anunnaki.me) as an experiment. here&#x27;s more about the idea and how the service works: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;is.gd&#x2f;ysjkxm (alternatively, you can watch this video for quicker introduction: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;is.gd&#x2f;gqgxsw).<p>till now, here&#x27;s what i&#x27;ve got:
- around 60 active alpha testers whom i have chosen carefully to test the system.
- around 500 on the waiting list, 200 of which have shared their comments on why they would like to use it and how it could help them in their daily activities.
- +19000 saved bookmarks (from the 60 active users).
- i&#x27;m getting 50 new waiting list signups on average every month.<p>there are many ways the can be improved and i&#x27;ve received some amazingly detailed feedback from people currently using anunnaki that i would very much like to implement in the system.<p>as i&#x27;m fairly new to this (this is the first project that i work on that gets this much traction). what&#x27;s the best, most logical, next step?<p>notes: 1) i&#x27;m doing this part time. 2) i don&#x27;t live in the us.<p>thanks! 2013-06-18 10:42:22 UTC

3222576 ask hn: is there a good way to create pseudo-random passwords mentally? with more and more news about databases being cracked, and the fact that i use maybe 4 unique passwords for all the services i connect to, i'm wondering if any hners have devised schemes for creating <i>unique-ish</i> passwords for the services they access.<p>i don't want to use a password manager because not all services i access will happen just from a laptop, i would love some kind of scheme that can be mentally recited while allowing for something approaching a unique key. is there anything you guys use? 2011-11-10 23:57:32 UTC
5542075 ask hn: isn't bitcoin similar to a ponzi scheme? i would hate to say this but either it is one, or looks just like one. there will be losers and winners in this case. people who bought them early cash out and earn a huge profit. so where does the profits come from? thin air? from people who buy them at a higher price. and how do they cash out without making a loss? by cashing out at a higher prices when other people are buying.<p>it's almost like a never ending cycle until maybe bitcoin prices reaches infinity and beyond. someone has to win and someone will lose. you can't have everyone becoming bitcoin millionaires. big issue now is bitcoin prices are dropping fast. so good luck to those still holding on to those hot potatoes. cheers. 2013-04-13 01:02:56 UTC

5156153 ask hn: does a college degree matter? i'm an engineering drop out. i have 4yr+ working experience with 1yr+ in each of these sectors: technical support, marketing, freelancing and application development.
currently, i'm working as a software engineer at a  startup. now, i'm a bit confused whether or not should i consider getting a college degree. 
i have heard friends and colleagues say that a college degree is a must and i might face some problem in future without it. 
so, i ask hn users to offer their views so that it would help me change course if i have lost my way in my life. 2013-02-02 15:23:02 UTC

3695679 ask hn: how desired is working at apple? i'm a cs student looking for full-time employment (as a software developer) for after i graduate in may.<p>i'm strongly considering apple. a couple of pieces have shown up over the past few weeks about the culture of privacy at apple, and that's left me a little concerned. when people talk about large companies ideal for developers in the valley, i usually hear google/facebook/twitter, and i'm wondering why i don't usually hear apple on that list.<p>i'd really like to get a sense of some of the following from current/former employees or just people in silicon valley that have heard stories:<p>- is apple desired more or less than google/facebook/twitter?<p>- how selective is apple compared to google/facebook/twitter? i.e., is getting a job at apple considered a big deal in the tech industry, or do people consider google harder to get into? 2012-03-12 21:33:03 UTC
721209 ask hn: anyone working on a game? dear hn,<p>i am wondering if there are any startups working on games? if so, what kind of games and what platform are you targeting?<p>we ourselves are working on a gta-like game, which will be set in a different time, however. we are a very small team - currently 2 people. the biggest challenge is 3d modeling - we are working exclusively on our own tool to generate the game world semi-automatically. the only input will be a map and "skins" - and these skins will be modified by an artist. we hope to make the artist at least 10 times more productive than the norm - since we couldn't afford to hire 10 graphics guys :-), we need to make him super productive... 2009-07-24 09:41:55 UTC

3002370 ask hn: is your business a company or a product? when i read the stories on hn of people promoting their new product, i see many people starting businesses whose names are the same as the product they're selling.  this is different than some traditional notions of companies where their name is different from their product, and they have diversified into one or more product categories.<p>my feeling is that if the company's name is different than the product that they're selling, the company can create any number of potential products without having to reincorporate or shut down operations (under the previous business name).<p>there no 'one right way' of doing it, but is there an advantage (revenue, tax, buy out, etc) between having a company whose name is the same as their product (e.g. mobileworks), or one whose name is different from their product (e.g.: 37signals)?  if there's no advantage, why do people name their company after their product? 2011-09-15 22:24:34 UTC

3061471 ask hn: persevere, pivot, or fail? depending on which successful startup company you read about, you hear one of three lessons:<p>1) we had a great idea and while no one was buying it or giving us the time of day, we pushed forward.  many times only eating rats for weeks on end, but we had grit, if nothing else.  and then eventually we sold the company for $1b.<p>2) we had a great idea that was having trouble, but we realized there was this interesting aspect of our product that we pivoted on and this became macroware -- the largest software company ever.<p>3) we tried for six months, but clearly the idea had no legs.  many said to push for a full year, but i believe in failing fast.  so i killed the company, and that is what allowed me to start my next company, that made instantly made billions.<p>all these success stories face a crossroads where things aren't really going well and they all end with a different "moral to the story" ending.  but when you're actually living it in real life how do you figure out which story you're in?  should we hunker down and start eating rats, or fail now and move on to one of the other 50 ideas i have? 2011-10-01 23:36:49 UTC
3292506 ask hn: incubator doesn't like that i'm a single founder. offers alternative. hello, i'm a single founder of a very early start-up.<p>a month ago i was looking for incubators based in my area. when i had managed to find one, they said they were very impressed, but did not like the fact that i was a single founder. mostly because they don't provide seed funding, only mentoring and a demo day. after a week or so they called me offering two things:<p>1) an invitation to all their events.<p>2) to help find a start-up with a similar business model in need of a technical founder that i can join.<p>however i have a few fears related to the second  item in the offer.<p>1) i'd like to continue developing my product and  for me to join a team with a similar business model, i'd probably have to throw away my product.<p>2) i'm not sure how much input i would have in an already established group.<p>i haven't worked in a co-founding environment before. most of the time i would contract someone to help me with finer details and such.<p>hopefully someone can help me dispose of any irrationality in my fears. 2011-11-29 22:17:50 UTC
935708 functional programming didn't take off because we're imperative at heart. please criticize:<p>the argument usually goes that functional programming is inherently mathematical and that's why it isn't as big is it could have been, but i think that doesn't hold water. it's no harder than 'imperative' programming, just requires a slightly different mindset.<p>but when you look at it from a different perspective, not the 'maths/engineering' viewpoint but how humanity works we are all acting in an 'imperative' mode towards each other.<p>it structures our beliefs about authority, it's how (most, unfortunately) parents deal with their children, it is what we see when in science fiction books or movies we picture interaction between robots and humans or computers and humans:<p><pre><code>  do x, y or z and then report back for more work.
</code></pre>
functional programming forces you to break that habit, you no longer 'tell something what to do', you have to get in to a different mode of thinking.<p>that to me seems to be the key obstacle in mass adoption of functional programming, it simply does not fit the mindset of the people that are programming, because they're just like everybody else, this machine literally needs to be told what to do. 2009-11-11 18:11:45 UTC
5327751 ask hn: how to sell a framework if there are free alternatives? the company in which i work has a very good or mapping framework which significantly reduces the time to write all dao, dto etc. what is more it automatically makes changes in code when you change your data model. you simply don't have to waste your time on refactoring. it has very friendly api, good documentation, full support etc. the product was used in many e-commerce platforms which we developed world-wide. it's tested, trusty and in my opinion far easier to use and maintain than hibernate or ibatis. this is why my company wants to make it available to other programmers - unfortunatelly not for free. as you probably think it's not a stunner. this is why i wonder if there really is no place for such product? how would you try to sell something like this? what are your expectations from a product which has many free alternatives? 2013-03-05 22:13:35 UTC

5041323 ask hn: do people build websites in awk? i've been reading through classic shell scripting by arnold robbins and nelson h. f. beebe, it's a great book!<p>seeing how full-featured the classic unix/bsd/gnu/linux etc. toolkit is has left me wondering why perl, python, and ruby are so successful.<p>if there are absolutely no server-side applications that are made out of these classic software tools, it seems like there must be a reason why.<p>are there web applications that are made out of bash, sed, awk and all that? or for reasons of security, complexity or something else has putting all of these tools under one roof (first in the form of perl, later python and ruby) won the day? 2013-01-11 04:20:05 UTC
4177742 ask hn: php coders, what's preventing you from changing language? the flavor <i>du jour</i> today on hn come from a couple of articles describing the difficulties programmers have moving away from php, despite admitting that the language is somewhat broken.<p>i want to ask php devs on hn:<p>- have you considered moving away from php?
 - do you know any other language?

  2. sales is an uphill battle (for a developer).

  3. contributing back to oss improves you and your code.

  4. keeping a good work-life balance prevents burnout.

  5. experimenting makes you a better developer. 

  6. it&#x27;s harder than you think to build a simple tool like server check.in.

3118654 is university for everybody? i am first year computer science student and i've had lectures just for month now and i am already struggling with some courses. i've been programming since 15 years old and i love to do it, but now in university, i just can't handle the theory (computer engineering etc). so, maybe university is not for everybody? maybe i am just too stupid to get the degree of computer science? 2011-10-16 23:32:16 UTC

even worse, since i am searching for a c code, they could exhibit some bad practices i&#x27;d like to avoid...<p>i couldn&#x27;t find any option to sort the code by any popularity factor like stars, forks, or even issues...
on github, i can only sort repositories by stars or forks, not the code results.<p>so is there any way to limit code results to projects that are somewhat popular? did i miss any switch? 2015-09-16 09:06:48 UTC

4277733 ask hn: why is there no stopping apple's monopoly of tablet/phone's browsers? if there is lawsuit after lawsuit against microsoft for things such as, e.g., having internet explorer pre-installed, bundling their media player with the operating system, etc., then why the fuck hasn't there been anything done about the fact ios, as now more than ever, being in a dominant position in the tablet/smartphone market offers literally no alternatives of browsers or outlets with which to install software (app store)?&#60;p&#62;have they built something that slots perfectly in a loophole which prevents any kind of requirement of freedom of choice for browsers, and indeed all software? 2012-07-22 16:52:03 UTC

9044438 ask hn: would you be interested in a fpv drone/quadcopter racing event? hey folks - curious if there is any interest in a friendly competitive drone racing event. imagine showing up and racing either a stock fpv quadcopter setup or an entirely custom one against a group of like minded racers?<p>as an event host, we&#x27;d provide feeds to racers vehicles, prizes, course design and setup, logistics and all the other things necessary for a smooth running event. of course we&#x27;d provide alcohol and awards like &quot;best crash&quot;
one of the challenges is that the cost of the quadcopter&#x2f;drone might be prohibitive for casually interested people, but open to ideas. maybe we could organize a group buy and save some money for participants.<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=nsxyv-kgfio

as a ceo of a growing startup i don&#x27;t get to code as often as i like and when i do, i try not to annoy my team with my terrible code :) so to scratch the itch, i&#x27;ve built some of side projects related to what our company does. the latest is embedcurl.com<p>i see a lot of api docs and blogs posting curl commands that are really hard to read and i figured i could make them easier to read and add some niceties like easier copy&#x2f;paste, tooltips on flags, etc. they also gracefully degrade if javascript isn&#x27;t enabled back to a &lt;pre&gt; element.<p>the parsing is done in python with shlex and argparse (thanks to my co-founder frank for helping with that part). we&#x27;re running this on our production infrastructure so it should scale just fine.<p>my friends at loader.io have already integrated it with their api docs: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;docs.loader.io&#x2f;api&#x2f;v2&#x2f;put&#x2f;tests&#x2f;:test_id&#x2f;run.html<p>i&#x27;d really like your feedback, especially if you enter a command that doesn&#x27;t parse correctly.<p>thanks! 2013-12-30 23:10:24 UTC

3690627 tell hn: steal my ideas i've got a few ideas and i'm not sure if they'll ever see the light of day. i'm happy to share them with hn in the hopes that you work on them or they help give you other ideas. some may already exist, and if so, i apologize!<p>idea #1) a scholarship service/site that doesn't suck<p>you'd think finding scholarships wouldn't be that hard, but you're in for a surprise. my wife is fixing to start graduate studies and i've been pouring over scholarship/fellowship sites for her. i've spent countless hours just looking for ones for her to apply to, and i've visited 20+ scholarship search engines.<p>they're filled to the brim with scam/"you could win $100,000! sweepstakes" type scholarships. they also have tons of extra offers from paid for profit universities. lastly, they display scholarships that she isn't even qualified for, despite narrowing the filters to ones that she is supposed to be qualified for.<p>i've found different scholarships on each site, so there's not even a single site that has all of the same scholarships on it. i'm starting to wish at this point that there was a paid service that someone could just pay $x for. they'd research for you and send you back a huge list of scholarships that were tailored just for you.<p>for that matter, you'd think there would be a better service out there that would research anything like that. kind of like google answers/mturk, only for in depth things. for example, maybe i'm interested in opening a bakery and i want someone to do the research for me for all the competitors in the area, what they charge, what they have on the menu, the size of their bakeries, the available properties in the area, the legal requirements of opening a bakery and getting licensed in the city, etc.<p>idea #2) an expat job site that actually helps you immigrate, aka overseas recruiters<p>i've flirted with the idea of immigrating elsewhere for a while now. but the sheer volume of things you'd have to do just to immigrate is mind boggling, not to mention different for every country. some professions can help you get a green card in x country, but not y, etc. i wish there was a site that would be designed for hopeful expats that would connect them with jobs from employers in other countries that hire foreign workers. the site could also guide you through the immigration process, kind of like legalzoom does for creating a company.<p>idea #3) sortfolio for x<p>sortfolio is a neat tool because it's a great way to browse web designers visually. there's lots of other things that could benefit from having this, like what about web/mobile app developers? videographers? what about a way to browse local/regional bands for weddings/gigs?<p>idea #4) sponsorme<p>how many hours in a given week do you spend on youtube? what about your friends? tons of youtube members easily have 10,000+ subscribers. it's true that they can choose to display ads on their videos, but what about cutting youtube out of the equation? if someone has a video series where they review phones, wouldn't it be neat to be able to reach out to the content creators directly and have them mention your app in their video, or wear your company tshirt? american idol for instance does this with coke cups drank by the judges (or at least they used to). think about how much time they get of their product being on screen.<p>the site could basically be a marketplace that lists both youtube members who are willing to take on sponsorships and possibly their rates, as well as companies looking to advertise their products. you could browse by category to find the best people to partner with. the site doesn't have to stop at youtube, as there are also traditional bloggers out there that might be interested.<p>idea #5) "beat mine" restaurant, aka the reddit restaurant<p>a brick and mortar concept for a restaurant. the restaurants menu is driven by the patrons. for example, let's say the restaurant offers a chocolate cake. you try it but you know your homemade chocolate cake is better. you submit the recipe and the restaurant offers it temporarily. if enough patrons vote for it, that chocolate cake takes the place as their chocolate cake. you could offer a tiny percentage of sales of that dish as commission to the recipe submitter. this would provide constant incentive to keep trying to top that item. but who knows, maybe people (and/or the kitchen staff) demand familiarity when they go to restaurants and this would be a horrible failure. 2012-03-11 16:47:47 UTC

9727297 keepass – questionable security i&#x27;ve been a long-time user of keepass. i inspected its 2.x .net source code today and quickly noticed the following issues which i find quite concerning:<p>the kdbx database is encrypted with aes in cbc&#x2f;pkcs7 mode <i>without</i> proper authentication. hmac is nowhere to be found in the code, other than when used for sha1-totp. there are sha2 hashes that seem to guard the integrity of ciphertext, while these might catch a typical file corruption they will not prevent malicious tampering. even if the hashes are used prior to encryption, that&#x27;s still mte - not etm.<p>keepass likely does not have an online threat model, so attacks like padding-oracle might not be applicable, but a lack of aead is imho highly concerning because it indicates that the author(s) are winging it when it comes to doing crypto right.<p>byte array comparisons are done with this function from memutil.cs:<p><pre><code>		public static bool arraysequal(byte[] x, byte[] y)
		{
			&#x2f;&#x2f; return false if one of them is null (not comparable)!
			if((x == null) || (y == null)) { debug.assert(false); return false; }

			if(x.length != y.length) return false;

			for(int i = 0; i &lt; x.length; ++i)
			{
				if(x[i] != y[i]) return false;
			}

			return true;
		}
</code></pre>
there are many other questionable patterns, code smells, and &quot;i-invented-it&quot; approaches that indicate a non-expert .net programming skill. they can&#x27;t even implement a singleton correctly (see cryptorandom.cs).<p>has anyone ever done a security audit of keepass 2.x or does everyone just believe that it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;?<p>p.s. none of this detracts from the fact that keepass is a very useful, free utility with a lot of effort put into it. i thank all contributors for making&#x2f;improving it over the years. 2015-06-16 17:10:30 UTC

1022781 ask hn: dealing with comment overload hn traffic increased lately; though quality didn't decrease significantly. the matter isn't here, but in comments. for example for the tutol story there had been 100+ comments (and they are long also).<p>i just can't read/discuss with other people if i come back a little late (after the story is flooded with comments). this makes me nervous and unable to keep with the discussion.<p>we should find a solution to that. may be an algorithm that matches users and those shows only comments of your matched-users to help you discuss out of the crowd.<p>what do you think? just let it how it is now? 2009-12-30 17:42:42 UTC

7869069 ask hn: hints for plain language legal? i&#x27;ve got scores of pages of legal, across multiple documents for this early stage project. it&#x27;s quite hard to decipher.  i understand boilerplate is part of a lot of these things - as well as some project specific definitions.  of course i&#x27;ve talked to council about these, i&#x27;m informed.  my partners have proper council as well.  but we keep sorting through all these docs, sorting numbers, making sure it&#x27;s in the proper places and all that.<p>why don&#x27;t these things come with cover letter or executive summary on the front - like one sentence bullet points to summarise the rest of the document.<p>then i&#x27;d have something to understand; my council could verify with the long-form details.  couldn&#x27;t all the long-form documents references points on the short-form?<p>like:
  &quot;compensation will be $200k&#x2f;yr[1]&quot;<p>and the long form could reference [1] all over the place?  like variables?<p>does this exist? are there any good places to get some plain language legal documents? 2014-06-09 16:15:24 UTC

876182 a story of bold risk paying off (cirque du soleil founder) in today's news:
the canadian billionaire arrived in kazakhstan on sunday aboard a russian spacecraft, along with russian cosmonaut gennady padalka and american astronaut michael barratt, according to russian state news agency ria novosti.<p>where it all began...<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guy_laliberté
guy laliberté was born into middle-class family in québec city, canada in 1959, the son of a nurse and a public relations executive for the alcan aluminum corporation.[3] by the time he was sixteen, he had decided to pursue a career in the performing arts after producing several high school events. after graduating, he became involved with a folk music group called "la gueule du loup", playing the accordion andharmonica. his work on the folk music scene was what introduced him to the art of street performance. after quitting college, laliberté toured europe as a folk musician and busker. he had learned the art of fire breathing by the time he returned home to quebec in 1979. although he became employed at a hydroelectric power plant in james bay, his job ended after only three days due to a labour strike. supported by his unemployment insurance, he decided not to look for another job. instead, he joined the stilt-walking troupe "les échassiers de baie-saint-paul" that was led by gilles ste-croix. shortly afterward, laliberté and ste-croix organized a summer fair in baie-saint-paul with the help of laliberté's soon-to-be business partner daniel gauthier.[4][5]
this festival, called the "la fête foraine", first took place in july 1982 touring quebec. ironically, the event was barred from its host town shortly thereafter because of complaints by local citizens. laliberté managed and produced the fair over the next couple years, nurturing it into a moderate financial success.[4] but it was during 1983 that the government of quebec gave him a 1.5 million dollar grant to host a production the following year as part of quebec's 450th anniversary celebration of the french explorer jacques cartier's discovery of canada. laliberté named his creation "le grand tour du cirque du soleil."[6][7] the celebration turned out to be a critical and commercial success. although the first tour of cirque only netted a forty-thousand dollar profit, it allowed him to sign almost 1.5 million dollars in contracts. they had been performing exclusively for canadian audiences until 1987 when laliberté risked everything and took his circus to the los angeles arts festival. it cost the production's entire cash reserve to make the move. had it not been successful, he would not have had the money to move the troupe back home to québec.[8]<p>in today's news
http://www.cnn.com/2009/tech/space/10/11/space.clown.lands/index.html<p>cirque du soleil founder guy laliberte, sporting a foam clown nose, landed back on earth after a $35 million working vacation at the international space station.<p>guy laliberte, wearing a foam clown nose, smiles after landing sunday in kazakhstan. 2009-10-12 06:24:43 UTC

1008524 twitter whats in it for the average joe? the rich get richer and we get..........<p>with twitter signing a new deal with google and microsoft what does this actually mean for you and me.<p>if blogging is dead (or at least for the 99.9% of bloggers who can't make a living from it) how will twitter making a profit benefit the average joe? will twittering for fame and fortune go the way of the blog?<p>twitter does fill a need in that we can all have a piece of our favorite celebs by knowing what they had for breakfast, when they are stuck in traffic. we are their friends no make that followers (don’t cults have followers?).<p>so great we can find out what clubs they like, when their movie is coming out and this of course translates into money for them through endorsements and ticket sales. i follow you. i'm a part of it so where's my cut?<p>but what does this really mean for the normal guy? what’s the point in having 100k of followers if they don’t know you or care what you say? inversely what’s the point in having 35 loyal followers that can’t give the exposure you crave.<p>with the top 25 twitter accounts, i could go on, all previously established brands and/or celebs before twitter their twitter presence is merely just an extension of their brand.<p>so it would seem to me that the rich get richer and the poor will just move onto the next get rich, or not rich scheme.<p>how many people do you know (personally) that got rich from podcasts, blogging, youtube, video broadcasting and iphone apps? me not so much. 2009-12-21 20:19:35 UTC

820507 ask hn: looking for a shared overview / task app for teams, native and live. i've used countless project, task, and ticket tracking systems and continue to love what i'm using right now (lighthouse). i've also attempted to integrate yammer into my teams day to day with mixed success. what i'd really like is something that does the following (while complimenting the ticket tracking system we're using):<p>allows everyone on the team to see what everyone else is working on at a glance. no scrolling through a feed (any discussion about what they are working on would happen after a click away from the default view). i would also be able to set what they are working on as the product manager which might simply be a reference to a ticket number in lighthouse.<p>since this would be a real-time application it would be nice if the team could have instant chats as well, at any time.<p>why would any of this matter if our ticket tracking system is working fine? well, not everyone on the team is a developer and they tend to stay away from lighthouse unless they really have to log in. designers, marketing folks, and the higher ups still want to know what's going on and in some cases it's my job to assign them tasks. i can't expect them to use a tool that's geared towards developers, especially because all they want is a very fast view of what's happening now.<p>i really hope i'm describing a tool that already exists. my hope is there is a native mac/windows application that supports this, but browser based would work i suppose. 2009-09-13 20:13:37 UTC

9459996 show hn: flipfeed flipfeed is a continuous stream of ephemeral photos and messages, where you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to see next!<p>the app is <i>smooth</i> to use. it&#x27;s called flipfeed, because it&#x27;s a continuous stream of photos and messages. you&#x27;re shown a photo or a text-message posted by someone, you have 30 seconds to view it, or you swipe to flip open the next photo or message. so, as you might have guessed, you can post photos and texts on the app. every new post gets added at the end of the feed, so we&#x27;re talking a <i>big, long continuous feed</i>.
there&#x27;s also a reply feature, so you can reply back to the original poster, or to your friends (kind of like forwarding an email).
another thing you can do is, instead of sharing publicly on flipfeed, you can share privately with friends (like composing a new email).<p>me and my friend have been working on it - we are the co-founders, and we&#x27;ve only recently launched it.<p>here are few of the things we&#x27;ve observed mainly:
<i>people like it a lot when they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re going to see next.</i>
<i>ephemeral adds a very good angle to the app.</i> and
<i>people like to talk between their friends a lot!</i><p>please feel free to provide feedback.<p>url: flipfeed.co

2588003  rate my sideproject that by-pass paywalls to gather content i've been working on this sideproject for a few weeks now and i believe , it's fine for a public release. 
the basic idea is that: you can use this tool to have rss feeds generated from any website (no flash sites), and fetch full content from any feeds, no matter if the original feeds only offers excerts or is behind a paywall. i plan to introduce premium features for monetization. the tool will come in handy when you come across sites that only have partial feeds, and also when all that you want is to generate one page feed with all main content found on any site that interests you, but whose layout is unpractical. here's a sample of the hackernews feed url: http://feeds.feedburner.com/feedsapi/bwpx<p>any feedback is much appreciated. thanks! 2011-05-26 15:12:24 UTC

368810 ask hn: start-up idea - pandora for u.s. neighborhoods thought i'd toss this one out there and see what people made of it.<p>i run a chicago news magazine.  when searching around for local stuff i've found many, many awful, adsense-filled, ugly, poorly-written "neighborhood guide" sites targeting people moving or new to an area.  it's had me wondering if there's an elegant, scalable, truly useful way to get that sort of info across.<p>so what about a neighborhood suggestion engine?  you build up a "genome" of us neighborhoods in major cities (i.e. included on craigslist) and push suggestions out to a user based on what they're into.  when they pick one, they get a clean layout that pulls from the real-estate sites, yelp, craigslist, flickr, youtube, everyblock, spotcrime and all the other local sites out there.  you could scan these apis to serve up a "coolness" rating (social media activity relative to other neighborhoods) etc.  on this point i've not yet figured out what you'd offer different from the real-estate search sites other than aggregating them all in one place.<p>so, pandora for neighborhoods.<p>how would you build it? monetize it?  market it?<p>good idea?  lame idea?<p>another way to pitch it would be as a hyperlocal media finder.  not sure if the content itself is compelling enough though. 2008-11-18 22:15:58 UTC

3619078 ask hn: whats easy and reliable contacts importer/inviter service? hi,
we need to allow our users to invite friends using their address book from popular email services like gmail, hotmail, yahoo, rediffmail and also from social networks like facebook, orkut etc. 
there are many sites like
openinviter.com
invitebox.com
cloudsponge.com
contactgrabber.com
getmycontacts.comsuper-tell-a-friend.com
inviteallfriends.net
smartaddon.com
(found them by searching google)
however, i am not sure of their reliability. im wondering what most successful and serious startups are using to allow their users to invite their friends. 
it should be reliable and easy and work with php/yii. i would love it if its free but its also ok if there is a small monthly fee.
any suggestions? 2012-02-22 02:17:46 UTC

4299005 ask hn: what about rechargeable pricing plans? i live in europe and i can't use stripe for recurring payments. i didn't want to go with other services because they seem too expensive and quite complicated to setup.<p>so i thought to myself, why not implement a simple rechargeable system, where the user simply pays through a paypal pay now button? 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months plans. after the period is over, the users are reminded to re-charge in order to continue using my service.<p>from a user perspective this has several positive outcomes:<p>1) the user isn't locked into any month-to-month thing.<p>2) they don't need to store their credit card info anywhere - stripe and other 3rd party services are pci compliant, but users feel safer knowing that their cc info is only used for that specific transaction and not being stored somewhere.<p>3) the user is in control. just like my pre-paid cellphone, i charge it whenever i'm out of credit - it's just simpler than having something that bills me monthly. just the feeling that a service is connected to my credit card makes me feel a little unsafe.<p>why aren't services being built this way? am i missing something? 2012-07-26 22:06:52 UTC

7942543 how much to integrate a one-page-scroll into an angularjs single-page app? how many hours would to take to integrate a one-page-scroll theme into an angularjs spa app?<p>how many hours would you take to integrate a theme like below into a mean.io single page app?<p>for a theme that works exactly like this:
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;sveccdesign.com&#x2f;preview&#x2f;applight&#x2f;v2&#x2f;versions&#x2f;white&#x2f;2&#x2f;<p>and has a background video on the first slide&#x2f;page as shown in this:

* in house (sensitive stuff)
* self administered (the users should be in control)<p>i feel like this sort of functionality is often a side-effect, but i&#x27;m not aware of anyone who&#x27;s made this sort of the product the main course. 2014-05-02 04:14:54 UTC

3194165 resources to become more familiar with cs aspects of programming, optimization i'd like to keep my career moving more towards working with bigger applications that are highly scalable. i'm considering a move back to the sf bay area (aka silicon valley), where i'm originally from but have not really worked as a developer professionally other than freelance type of projects when i was just starting out and from what i have discerned, they are big on knowing data structures really well, big o, good algorithm knowledge, etc. so far, i've honed my skills with smaller companies that probably aren't scaling to the degree that companies i may want to work for there are and therefore the bar has been lower for me so far.<p>for example, at my current company, its not uncommon to find code where method calls are made within a loop to where the data its retrieving never changes (so its being called n number of times when it only needs to be called 1 time), so obviously the bar's pretty low and i have a feeling that doing something like that in a larger application would be pretty damaging (just kind of going off on a tangent here but basically the bar is pretty low where i am not so i'm not really being pushed to learn a lot about optimization). anyways, am wondering if anyone has any recommendations for good resources (books would be good) on learning some of the things i may have missed / glossed over so far in my career to better prepare myself to be the type of developer that a company in silicon valley would want working on their server-side code.<p>from what i understand topics like optimizing algorithms and big o notation are big interview topics (and topics beyond the interview obviously, when doing the actual work). i'd like to find a book, for example, that is thorough enough to where i learn all the basics but not too hard to dive into and keep things interesting.  any advice is appreciated 2011-11-03 23:25:49 UTC

3642189 ask hn: relocating from europe to silicon valley hi,<p>discalimer: i'm using a throwaway account to post this.<p>lt;dr: after paying tax and rent, how viable is living on $4800/mo (in total, for two people) in silicon valley?<p>i have recently been offered by the company i work for to relocate to our silicon valley office to lead a growing engineering team. i currently live in europe, and i'm trying to get to grips with the standard of living i could expect.<p>i have a spouse who would relocate with me, but not get a working visa. this means i would have to support her fully.<p>the offer i received was for $90k + $2k/mo housing aid. we are planning to rent a 2 bedroom place in the valley, and we would also need to get a car.<p>now, even after doing some research i am having trouble figuring out what kind of standard of living we would get out of my salary. seems ~1/3 of the pay would leap into the pockets of uncle sam and the state of ca, so given that we rent a place for $2200/mo that would leave around $4800 to cover food, utilities, car, gas, insurance, phone, cable and all other expenses. this would also need to cover some savings to counter the fact that working in the us for a period of time will effectively halt our pension savings in europe for that time.<p>so, my question is: what kind of standard of living does this get us? 2012-02-28 06:49:10 UTC

3710205 looking for a technical cofounder i am a designer. i started my project with a good technical co-founder, but he is having trouble committing the project and has to focus on paying work. the product concept is pretty detailed and well-thought-out.<p>what i am hoping for is someone who has an interest in working with music culture. the product is really easy to be passionate about if you are a musician, a producer, or are related to, friends with, or sleeping with one. this isn't a hard requirement, but it will help you understand the customer and his or her needs and how the product solves them. musicians i have talked to get it instantly, and non-musicians tend to need a little convincing.<p>from  a technical point of view, there will be a lot of big data, relatively complex algorithms, and machine learning involved.<p>i am a lightweight coder from my ui background, so i can be a padawan coder or do unit testing when there is a lull in the design work.<p>it should go without saying, but i'll say it anyway: i have a good design for a good product concept, but i am looking for an actual partner, not an engineering bitch. the long-term success of this product will be based on the ingenuity and creativity we bring to the engineering. i want to build a successful partnership with someone who can take technical ownership of this and work with me to create something amazing.<p>so if you are looking for a project to work on or to apply with, then give me a few minutes over the phone or skype or in-person and i'll tell you what i'm up to and why i think it will be a success.<p>i am based in cupertino, ca.

4633830 ask hn: best practices when working with teams i work with web development for almost 10 years and i have always worked by myself. now i have to manage a team of developers and i have no idea how to do it. in my head i already have everything solved, how the code should be done and so on... i don't know if i should tell everyone how things should be done (according with what i already have solved in my mind) or if i should let the team decide those things.<p>another question is that i have always worked from the top down, i mean, i always implement the ui and work my way down from there. now i need to separate concerns and i'm not so sure how that could be done efficiently.<p>i know that there are really smart guys here and i would greatly benefit from your advice. thanks! 2012-10-09 20:44:02 UTC
3232929 ask hn: working on a site to find a cofounder hey guys i wanted to get your thoughts on this i have been working on making a website for finding a co founder called operationcofounder.com i have been currently using it as website to host all the company names i have picked up for all the 100's of ideas i have. i created all the logos for them except for like 4 or 5.. i have created a ruff mockup of what i would be looking to do.. i want to create a video to spread the word of what i am looking to do and who i am looking for in a co founder. please if you could let me know what you think of the layout and if this the right direction to head.. here is the link to the mockup.. operationcofounder.com/layout.png  .. thanks 2011-11-14 05:04:10 UTC
526176 ask hn: moving buku files from one remote server to another? i'm about to move many gb (about 11gb) of files from one unix based host to another.<p>here is how:
1. ssh into old.
2. tar and gzip everything (to save on bandwidth and time in transfer).
3. ssh into new.
4. use scp to move this tar/gzipped file
5. gunzip the file
6. profit (well, be done anyway)<p>can anyone tell me if there is a better (more bandwidth efficient, faster, safer, smarter, etc.) way than this? 2009-03-21 15:01:40 UTC
7836611 how much math is needed to break crypto systems, really? i see so much conflicting information and opinion on this i thought id just come out and ask. if you were to getting started in breaking applications, and your interest was specifically breaking the cryptography built into applications, is your time better spent learning the math behind crypto or the programming behind the code?<p>this question has been bothering me for awhile, and its down to the comments iv seen on hn and elsewhere that most of the serious crypto attacks that appear in the wild were known about in the literature first. 2014-06-02 21:36:45 UTC

1885538 ask hn: when your production webapp breaks, what do you do? when you don't know how to fix it, what do you do?<p>for those that are not yc alum, what are the options?<p>just sit on stack overflow until someone can help you ? or check out the other forums and irc chans?<p>is there not some other service/way you can get help when you need it? 2010-11-09 06:01:49 UTC

463427 why not require your users to bring in new users to your site to avoid account suspension? for example, you might require each user to bring in two new active users every month.<p>if they don't, their account will be suspended until they do.<p>why would users put up with this? it is in their self-interest to have the site succeed.<p>once traffic is high enough, this policy can be relaxed/eliminated.<p>p.s.  i'm very upset with the failure of both http://numbrosia.com and http://chatbotgame.com to bring in much traffic.  numbrosia in particular can be very addictive but there is little incentive for addicted players to get their like-minded friends to play. 2009-02-03 03:11:34 UTC

6699768 piui can't connect from phone, desktop is ok thanks for piui, it is just what i was needed to be able to control my piface from the phone.
i got it working and i can use the demo app within a browser in a computer connected to it. however i can&#x27;t manage to get a phone to show the demo app:
1. on android it disconnects to the access point saying the connecion to the internet is slow
2. on an iphone it says it is not connected to the internet, so it cant show the app
i confirm that if i dig @raspberrypi piui , the dns server shows the correct ip and that the iphone connection shows the raspberry pi as dns server 
any clue what can i try from here ?
thank you 2013-11-08 23:17:45 UTC

10176636 tell hn: back up your hard drive back that $<i></i>* up. for the second time this week i am just haystacking through issue after issue because i don&#x27;t have a clean backup. i am super broke so i actually couldn&#x27;t afford a big enough drive, but still there is no excuse.<p>first time i had a non-consecutive exception in my mavericks main partition. i made a rescue but after upgrading a partition to yosemite, linux wouldnt boot and refind wouldn&#x27;t show up because of this new logical disk partition. it took like 4 hours to scp all my data to another computer, then reformat and set my environment up again.<p>2. accidentally moved &#x2f;usr&#x2f;libexec instead of &#x2f;usr&#x2f;libexec&#x2f;sharingd. with filevault on, this became a mega headache. now my disk is partitioned in half (after fighting to decrypt the drive) and downloading yosemite to the partition. all because i modified a root directory path and put it back off by a directory. i am almost done fixing it now after another ~1.5 hours of install &amp; config. apple was awesome about allowing me support a month out of warranty but the &quot;executive team&quot; didn&#x27;t seem to even know what a terminal was.<p>tl;dr but seriously, image your computer, server, keurig coffee machine, whatever because when your data is as corrupt as your gov&#x27;t, even they can&#x27;t help you. 2015-09-06 02:06:03 UTC

9352531 producer/consumer dilemna: chicken and egg? i am starting to market a new web-based subscription service which needs both producers to maintain their data and consumers of that data. it&#x27;s creating a chicken&#x2f;egg scenario since the producers don&#x27;t want to be maintaining their data if there are no consumers, and the consumers don&#x27;t want to subscribe if there is no producer&#x27;s data.
how do others market this type of service where both parties are needed simultaneously for the service to work? 2015-04-10 04:10:14 UTC

1810034 ask hn: how do you decide what to use in building a product? i got my bs in computer science in 2004. i'm now finishing my mba at berkeley but i've become very rusty.<p>in college, i developed some basic web apps on the "latest" technology with a famp stack (freebsd 4, apache 2 beta, mysql 4, php 4), some perl on the backend and light client-side javascript.  i tinkered some ajax in 2005 but that's where it ended.  ror, drupal, cakephp, django, lift or any of the dozens of seemingly awesome frameworks weren't around.  mongodb, hive (which i'm actually experienced with), nginx, soap, rest, json, git didn't exist either.<p>with so many new technologies, how should a developer approach building a new web app (i.e. most yc products)? which language(s) and/or framework(s) to use?<p>maybe this is a whole semester's worth of discussion. but any rules of thumb, rubrics or specific points of comparison would be greatly appreciated!<p>thanks,

4850892 ask hn: feedback needed for myrentr.com, a universal rental application hey guys. long time lurker and first time poster.<p>i currently have a san francisco roommate matching site (think grouper but for housing) called bunksf.com. while working on bunk i have noticed that people searching for housing are having to fill out multiple rental applications at $30 bucks a piece. it seemed crazy to me because each application is asking for the same info. because of this, i created myrentr.com.<p>the idea of myrentr.com is like the common college application but for apartments. users buy our application for $30 (this may change) and we do the background check, employment check and credit check. afterwards we put all the info in a nice little document (also includes photo, social media links, and personal blurp) so the user can give the application to whoever they choose.<p>we have also created a craigslist widget, so people who have spare rooms and are posting on cl can ask that their potential applications bring a completed app. it seems crazy to me that property companies spend the time to run their tenant's credit when it would be much easier to ask the tenant to bring a completed app to the showing.<p>any feedback/criticism would be wonderful! thanks for you time 2012-11-29 23:16:39 UTC

4818143 ask hn: what's a healthy submission pattern on hn? i once read a top comment putting down a submitter because he only submitted his own stuff.<p>in submitting other people's stuff, i find i'm always late after a quick search. is it a game? if it's been posted but didn't gather much attention, or it has been years, is it fine to post again? obviously there are outlier articles, and those black swans are the real gems, as opposed to your average big/niche media article. but i'm not exploring the depths of the web everyday, most days i get most of my reading from the curation hn is already doing. i'm spending my every day building stuff and writing stuff.<p>my stuff isn't likely to be posted by someone else. if most people posted their own stuff, wouldn't we get to see more outliers while the unremarkable just wouldn't trend? is it looked down upon to mostly/only post those? 2012-11-22 09:38:24 UTC
5632410 when bugs cost users' money (airbnb's in this case) what is your responsibility when a bug affects a user? does that responsibility change when it costs your users money?<p>the regrettable inevitability of bugs in software has been documented by greater than i and to begrudge their existence would be as pointless as someone with 1 karma posting on hn (oh, wait). more interesting is the responsibility a developer feels (be that an individual or an organisation) when a bug affects their users and how the user's loss affects their reaction.<p>i've worked on various consumer and business facing products and have always taken bugs personally, endeavouring to redress the deficit caused by my, or my colleagues', negligence (all be it, inevitable). mercifully i've never actually caused a user to lose money but i was recently a victim and thought i'd share:<p>i travel to paris most weeks for work and use http://airbnb.com quite often to stay a couple of nights in apartments around the city. today i'll be moving into a place that i booked around a week ago and, just yesterday, the owner and i realised that i was charged only a half of what they was expecting. it turns out that airbnb were afflicted by some bug at the time of my booking that meant i saw and booked the apartment for half the cost (this was confirmed in an email to the host that i haven't seen yet, but will later). so that i have somewhere to stay tonight, we've compromised by meeting half way so that we're equally out of pocket (and i'm going to look after their cats, which is actually a bonus).<p>clearly airbnb aren't going to cover the cost of their mistake as this would expose them to much greater liabilities, but what <i>should</i> their responsibility be in this case? i know that if it had been my fault then i would feel pretty bad about the situation and grovel like the pathetic wretch i am, but would i feel compelled to compensate? perhaps personal responsibility has give way to corporate necessity.<p>still, seems pretty off to me... 2013-04-30 14:40:50 UTC

156595 compete stats vs. real stats (round 1) compete shows that hacker news got 75,000 visitors in march...here:<p>http://grapher.compete.com/ycombinator.com_uv.png<p>pg stats show approx 110k + visitors:<p>http://ycombinator.com/images/traffic-24mar08.png<p>in the past my comparisons show that compete usually only shows 70-80% of the traffic a site gets. is anyone interested in sharing some stats on their site ( i will do the same ) to get a better picture of how inaccurate compete really is? 2008-04-07 02:06:57 UTC

(don't break the chain!)<p>- kiss (doing only one thing and not the kitchen sink)<p>- free (can't beat free, isn't it?)<p>- should have ads with high click ratio (nothing to do when the day is checked except clicking ads. user should come back to the app daily)<p>i've submitted to lifehacker and use admob with the maximum ads exchange mode to gain some momentum. what other marketing trick should i do? some video promotion maybe?<p>ps:submitting to hn is part of my promotion tricks<p>pss:i plan to release numbers in a month about install and ads revenue.. 2009-04-30 13:25:12 UTC

4557682 ask hn: module oriented programming what if there was a programming paradigm that evolved around modules rather than classes? in such a hypothetical paradigm, i would envision the following:<p>* classes do not exist; code is organised into modules.
* modules have private fields, functions and parameters.
* there is no concept of inheritance; you build up a module using composition.  for example: module "warp-drive" has-a sub-module "fuel chamber".
* modules interact with each other via message passing.  
* there is no concept of abstract modules, instantiating modules, etc. each module exists as a concrete entity which can contain sub-modules and can be contained within other modules.
* there is no concept of static fields; if you want to have a "static" like data member, you would create a separate module with that data which passes this information to whichever modules are interested in consuming it.<p>what is your opinion on such a system?
this musing was brought about my personal frustration in learning oop and wrapping my mind around some of the more abstract concepts.  what if things could be simpler, as indicated above?<p>the closest i found regarding this topic is this wikipedia article:

4070379 list of resources for learning ruby an earlier hn post about learning ruby (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4068633) got me thinking and since i haven't seen a good list of ruby learning resources all together in one place in a while i put together a few of what i think are some of the better resources, in no particular order - most are just ruby, a few are for rails. i'm sure i've missed a few good ones so let me know what those are.<p>(1) tryruby.org<p>(2) <i>the bastard's book of ruby</i> http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/<p>(3) pragmatic studio ruby course - http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby<p>(4) <i>eloquent ruby</i> by russ olsen<p>(5) http://www.rubymonk.com/<p>(6) http://www.rubykoans.com/<p>(7) <i>metaprogramming ruby</i> by paolo perrotta<p>(8) codeschool.com<p>(9) michael hartl's rails tutorial- http://ruby.railstutorial.org/<p>(10) <i>the rails 3 way</i> by obie fernandez<p>(11) http://www.railscasts.com 2012-06-05 19:31:01 UTC

293876 ask hn: looking for rails tutor, will pay i'm learning rails and am looking for somebody knowledgable that could help answer questions. i research most of the issues i have, but it would save me a lot of time and i'd learn faster if i could discuss the difficult questions with an experienced developer. the forums i've tried are generally unresponsive or unhelpful. i'd happily pay for this service.<p>if you're interested please shoot me an email at: matthew.h.mazur@gmail.com and we'll discuss how to do it.<p>(this could make a decent startup idea too) 2008-09-03 15:08:22 UTC
8521711 ask hn: should i release a saas with double license or not? hello,<p>i started a side project for our family business. now i reckon that it might have value as a saas, for others.<p>i don’t know if i should make the project open source or not. i’m keen to opt for a solution where there is an open source version, which you could install it on your server and a ‘pro’ version with additional features which i run on my servers (with api, integrations, etc.).<p>i would like to have some advice on the matter from people who had to make the same choice before.<p>another issue that might arise in case i opt for the double-license is what license should the open source version be released under. i took a look at sidekiq[1] which i think uses this model successfully and uses a proprietary license for ‘pro’ and lgpl instead of bsd or mit licenses. i don&#x27;t know why they went with lgpl over the other two though.<p>comments and thoughts are more than welcome, thanks!<p>[1] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;sidekiq.org 2014-10-28 16:11:56 UTC

7702827 simple, plain, customizable js dialogs. frustrated by the lack of a simple, customizable js dialog, i decided to create a mini library that captures the simplicity of the 3 classic js dialogs: alert, confirm, prompt, but allows for needed custom features like styling, button labels, and html5 placeholders for inputs. seeking feedback on any potential issues, code architecture and style, and general usefulness. before you chime in about jquery ui or some other framework&#x2f;library that has this included, think first about projects that don&#x27;t require such a heavily scripted or styled component and would benefit from a straightforward, easy to customize solution. 2014-05-06 04:25:07 UTC

9120093 ask hn: looking for a javascript contract but don't have code to show. what should i do? i&#x27;ve been working remotely for the last year as solo developer on a mvp for a startup, doing full stack work (php &#x2f; node.js &#x2f; jquery &#x2f; python). the product is in private beta and it&#x27;s not 100% related to the type of technologies i&#x27;d like to use in my next contract.<p>i just moved back to london, uk, and i&#x27;ve contacted many recruiters for javascript contracts: the point is, i&#x27;ve got many years of experience, great clients and a strong cv, however i don&#x27;t have any javascript projects to show that i&#x27;m proud of (the ones i&#x27;ve got are too old&#x2f;outdated technologies and they don&#x27;t really show my skills).
my github account is not very solid from this perspective either.<p>so i&#x27;m in the process of creating a portfolio to showcase four of the best and most recent&#x2f;relevant projects i&#x27;ve built, with the objective to use the portfolio itself to showcase my skills: i&#x27;ll then be able to use it as an example of code i&#x27;m proud of (or by looking at the source or by publishing it on github).<p>do you thinks it&#x27;s a viable solution? 
do you have any suggestion?<p>many thanks for your time. 2015-02-27 17:34:04 UTC

4536377 ask hn: how would you do escrow b/t users in bootstrap w/o paypal? tl;dr: need to do escrow between users without paypal, what do?<p>i`m the new cto, redoing connectwithcontractors.com(asp.net 2.0 webforms website) in bootstrap and open source technologies to love my life a little more and minimize scaling/hosting/dev costs and maximize utility, sanity, and on-boarding time.  the old app was too poorly implemented to get myself on-boarded without going to great lengths, so i taught the ceo just enough coding to understand the problem and sell him on a fresh start. check it out: connectwithcontractors.github.com
the asp.net app had an unfinished attempt at an escrow implementation via paypal.  i heard paypal intends to fix the issues they have had in the past, but i don't want to use them in our mvp, unless it's the fastest solution to the problem, in which case, so be it.<p>so what would you do hn? 2012-09-18 04:44:16 UTC

553144 ask hn: what software do you use for managing communications with media/blogs? we've been working on our own internal software here at miracle labs for tracking communications with the media, emailing blogs about news for our sites, and putting together press releases.<p>we were curious what other small-medium startups are using these days? prweb? some good open source solution?<p>do you have this problem and just manage it with gmail? what do you use? are you looking for tools that make it easier to announce/track/grow your own publicity?<p>we're debating opening up our tools as a cheap service for startups who don't have a big pr budget. i'd like to get an idea if this is something people want or if they've solved this problem in their own creative ways.<p>thanks in advance! 2009-04-08 18:16:17 UTC

424155 ask hn: sendmail vs mailto: links for viral content sharing? i have a widget that has share-on-digg and email-to-your-friends type functionality. i've implemented the emailing in what seems to be the standard fashion - a minimal dialog allowing entry of the to/from details, with the email then being sent using sendmail from my server. however there seem to be lots of issues with scalable email sending - host throttling, getting caught in spam filters etc. i'm wondering why i shouldn't change to using a browser mailto: link. i can still fill in the needed email content but the sending is then done from the users local machine and email mechanism.<p>having each user do their own sending seems like a more scalable and robust solution to me. but it doesn't seem to be standard practice with similar apps. any thoughts on why? are there a significant percentage of folks who don't have an email client set up correctly for mailto: to work? 2009-01-07 23:25:40 UTC

8459662 ask hn: orange-tinted sunglasses for programming at night? like many, i spend way too much time on the computer, including at night. and there is a lot of evidence the suggests that this is not good for you. hence why the software flux is so popular, and definitely helps out some.<p>i did some research and found another possible solution, amber sunglasses meant to block blue light. a popular option on the net is:<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.amazon.com&#x2f;uvex-s1933x-eyewear-sct-orange-anti-fog&#x2f;dp&#x2f;b000usrg90&#x2f;ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1413390677&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uvex+s1933x<p>aside from anecdotal reviews, there are some studies showing possible effectiveness:<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2f;pubmed&#x2f;20030543
&quot;at the end of the study, the amber lens group experienced significant (p &lt; .001) improvement in sleep quality relative to the control group and positive affect (p = .005).&quot;<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2f;pubmed&#x2f;22850476
basically, looking at tablets and&#x2f;or bluelight (wavelength 450-495 nm) at night, which suppresses melatonin production considerably, compared with blue-blocking glasses.<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2f;pubmed&#x2f;21552190
a similar study to above, where orange-tinted safety glasses where used to remove the melatonin suppression effects.<p>has hn had any experiences with blue-blocking lenses? does it help, or is it placebo and&#x2f;or nonsense?<p>cheers. 2014-10-15 16:51:02 UTC

1486886 meditation misunderstandings? there have been a number of posts lately about meditation.  i'm no expert on the subject, but it sounds to me like people have become upset over the topic and supposed benefits.  from my understanding of meditation, it seems like there is a fundamental misunderstanding.<p>my understanding is that the main purpose is to gain awareness.  awareness of everything going on inside you - thoughts, emotions, physical feelings within your body - in addition to awareness of all your surroundings.  "just sitting" will bring you some place, and i'm sure there are benefits there, but my understanding is that it's much more effective if it isn't as passive as that.  personally i haven't gotten far from "just sitting".  focus on awareness, awareness, awareness.  you may need to focus on breath, movements, sounds, thoughts, and emotions to realize your state of awareness and to maintain it, and that's ok i think.  at first it's necessary i would think.  from practicing this once in a while i've gained a lot in the past few months - clarity of thought, better focus, more self-control, better mood... 2010-07-05 01:39:06 UTC

3153893 uk's biggest customer-facing implementation of node.js the times and the sunday times will be launching an exclusive new dining experience, "eat out‟ which will provide hundreds of pounds of savings at a huge range of restaurants across the uk.<p>the innovative new strategy is coupled with bleeding-edge technology to deliver fantastic offers of great value to the brands' loyal customers. the "eat out‟ site was designed and built by award-winning digital agency clock limited. following on from the delivery of sunperks.co.uk, clock developed the entire site using new technology, node.js.<p>much like linkedin's app overhaul, what's on the surface may not be that spectacular to most but what's fuelling the engine underneath is extremely exciting for techies. the site has been built with extremely young technology, barely a year old, and enables far more utilisation of servers and hardware than ever before; cutting server down-time and boosting response rates. this is down to the much fabled node.js; a joyent-sponsored, server-side technology which is rapidly accruing attention in the web-development world.<p>for news international, clock limited also built the parent loyalty website mytimesplus.co.uk , which has been received extremely well by its new and existing members. the 'eat out' card will be available initially as an exclusive benefit for times and sunday times subscribers and will then be rolled out as a standalone product similar to taste and gourmet society in early 2012. the card will be sold for approximately £50 but remains as a complimentary benefit to times+ members (subscribers of the two newspapers). and by joining eat out, members will be able to take advantage of a range of great dining offers throughout the year at more than 700 top restaurants across the uk.<p>andrew sharland, clock limited‟s business director, said: “the industry is rapidly evolving and news international are clear market leaders in the monetisation and access of their content. matching this, we‟ve used cutting-edge technology for the new service so it‟s great to be on-board with such a courageous and innovative approach.”<p>jo coughlin, head of partnerships, the times and sunday times, said: “the eat out card is a new and innovative value offering from the times and the sunday times. this is our biggest and best dining offer yet which will see members making huge savings eating out at their favourite restaurants all year round.
“as we value our loyal customers the most, we are offering this exciting new benefit as an ongoing addition to the subscription pack via times+.”<p>paul serby, cto of clock limited discusses the decision to use node.js and the team's transition from php. “the decision to migrate, particularly on such a big project, was because of previous difficulties with php memory allocation, where our developers often found scaling hard as memory is quickly exasperated.”<p>the critical element about node, which is too often glazed over, is that it harmonises three platforms, allowing one language for browsers, apps and databases all written in javascript. so it's no longer a case of php for web, javascript for apps and sql for databases. “it's one set of tools, one development process and crucially, one skill for people to learn.” this implementation for eat out is one of the most important to date as the developers are monitoring how well node performs not just on a virtual server but actually out there "in the wild‟. the site's results will be strong indicators of the shape node will begin to take in a commercial industry and how it can be adopted.<p>times and sunday times subscribers can make the most of this new benefit by going to mytimesplus.co.uk
restaurants can join the scheme by contacting iain on eatoutcard@newsint.co.uk<p>www.clock.co.uk

3605579 my first experience with web advertising (reddit and facebook ads). recently i decided to partake in the aids/lifecycle 2012 bike ride fundraiser. this event is a 7 day, 545 mile ride from san francisco to los angeles. the event itself requires all participants to raise at least 3,000 (usd) dollars to participate in the ride. the event generates funds for sf and la non-profits that help provide public services that our state is unable to provide.<p>my first online advertising attempt was to buy a 24 hour sponsored post on reddit. these are the ads that show up in a darker blue color, at the top of the front page. this ad cost me $20 usd.<p>the post for my ad is here:<p>http://www.reddit.com/comments/pi1k4/hi_reddit_im_doing_a_7_day_545_mile_bike_ride_for/ which linked to my donation page (http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/chrisb)<p>as you can see in the comments, at first i had a grammar fail that caused all the comments to be about my error (expected on reddit:) ). i emailed reddit to have the error mid way through the day. they were nice to take care of this as the website was giving me errors. it also seems that once you post an ad, you can't edit the topic text. this ad was shown across all subreddits.<p>stats on the ad (reddit ad traffic page):
http://i.imgur.com/pnxgb.gif<p>outcome of this ad:<p>i had one donation for $25 usd. this was great, i made five dollars more than if i had just donated the money i used for the ad directly. i had hoped for more, but i will take what i can get.<p>with the reddit ad you only have two choices on who sees them. one is to have it displayed on all subreddits, and the other is to display the ad on only specific subreddits. i would imagine that reddit is sitting on a stockpile of user data in the user posts that could be used to create profiles of the users which would help in targeting them. maybe they can tell who is male and female, or maybe they could tell what your interests are based on the content of your posts? someone who posts about ron paul all day might be a good target for opposing politicians who want to change their vote?<p>the facebook ad:<p>i found a $50 dollar coupon for facebook advertising so i figured i should give it a shot. i've ran the ad for a couple of days now. in contrast to my reddit ad, i decided to target specific groups of people.<p>facebook ad stats and info:
http://i.imgur.com/fddzx.gif<p>from what i gather the ctr rate that i am seeing is extremely low. i'm sure a donation is less intriguing than most ads that are displayed so i am not too surprised.<p>conclusion:<p>i've found that advertising a donation request is very unpopular. i almost wonder if it is possible advertise something like this with any success at all.<p>i wanted to post my experiences here for anyone else who has never used online advertising. it has been interesting to see how something as small as a choosing a contrasting color for a graphic can make a difference on how many clicks you get. i've learned a lot, and now have even more motivation to work on a project of my own (such as writing an ios or android app). i can imagine if advertising works well for someone, it could be addicting.<p>i'm very shocked to see how expensive a click is on facebook/google adwords. i know that i personally accidently click ads more often than i do so on purpose. i'd hope that there is a way to cancel these clicks out. i assume this might be hard to do technically.<p>side comment:<p>google adwords: i had planned to pay for a google ad but soon found out it would not be possible. the site that i wanted to link to is not a top level domain: www.domain.com but rather url with a path: http://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/chrisb after contacting google to see if there was another option i found out that there wasn't. they were generally helpful which is a contrast to the support experience i usually hear about google.<p>my question:<p>does anyone who is an expert in this area have any tips for me to make my advertising more successful? are there any guides that are online? i'm most likely not going to be spending any more money on another ad (for my donation site anyway) unless i come up or find a good idea that could make the ad more effective.<p>thanks. 2012-02-18 00:37:27 UTC

2651694 ask hn: app store marketing strategies? howdy, hackers!
my first app store release is called lidpop (http://shinyplasticbag.com/lidpop/). it makes your computer play sound effects of your choosing when you open and close the lid. it sounds silly, but it's surprisingly gratifying.<p>it's been up in the app store for a week or so, and i'm trying to figure out how i can promote it. i thought that some of the folks here might have some advice, and i also thought this might be a question that other people have wondered as well. if any app store pros out there have thoughts, i'd love to hear them.<p>so, a few questions to get things going:<p>1. how much have you focused on a web site for the app? how much do you explain there?<p>2. have you tried any viral marketing strategies? what works, what doesn't?<p>3. how did you find your pricing sweet spot? right now, i'm at the bottom 99¢ tier. i have no idea how i can evaluate whether the app is worth more.<p>ps: i have some lidpop promo codes to share. hit me up at @lidpop on twitter if you're interested. 2011-06-14 03:29:46 UTC

4416697 start-up chile company installs pipelines by air (helicopter) http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tohl/tohl-elevating-infrastructure&#60;p&#62;for immediate release								 august 20, 2012
atlanta based start-up creates a proven solution for installing pipelines by helicopter, through new sustainable and cost-effective techniques.
tohl – a social enterprise with humanitarian &#38; industrial applications
atlanta, georgia –tohl has developed a new pipeline installation method that not only enables poor communities to cost-effectively have access to a continuous water supply, but also has significant disaster relief uses and industrial uses.  tohl is able to cost-effectively and quickly install pipelines by un-spooling large rolls of coiled tubing from helicopters.  the helicopters are able to reach remote locations in order to mobilize communities with a continuous supply of water.  other applications include mining, agriculture, and other sectors.  click this link to tohl’s 1st installation in action: http://youtu.be/_vkmsieaqiq
tohl’s methodology was first conceived of in the wake of the haiti earthquakes, when the georgia tech student, apoorva sinha, envisioned a fluid transport system that would cost-effectively and efficiently deliver fluids to victims of the earthquakes in haiti.  apoorva thought of using helicopter deployed supply lines to get water and supplies to the people who needed it directly after the earthquake disaster in haiti.  just last month, this dream was realized after the tohl team was able to complete its 1st installation by helicopter in the community of san jose de maipo in the country of chile in south america.
on july 5th, 2012, tohlcompleted the fastest known pipeline installation ever recorded.  a 1 km pipeline was installed via helicopter in only 9 minutes over mountainous terrain.  through tohl’s techniques, pipelines can now be installed cheaper and faster than ever before, which is crucial for people in developing countries.

3272784 ask hn: how does one stay geeky and secure good pay checks? this applies to those that may want to be able to fall back to
employed gigs when they're not working exclusively on startups and/or
side projects. many of us here are working on our own things on the
side, and there's a need to ensure that (1) we're well paid on the day
job, and (2) the work is still technical enough to compliment our side
work.<p>it's a global market place now, and as programmers we're often
competing against not just australia's best or (insert your country /
local city / university)'s best, it's the world's best - and there are
likely people in the world that are cheaper to hire than you that can
do the same thing. this is what keeps us in our game, forces us to
innovate, and makes this one of the most rapidly evolving industries
in the world - so i think in an overall sense it's a great thing.<p>however, i've noticed that the natural inclination in working "for the
man" is for people to want to get away from the tech work as fast as
they can, to work their way through the ranks of management. reasons
often cited are that "tech work can get outsourced very easily", or
that "it's just the thing to do when you want to get higher pay". but
what if you really like the tech work?<p>in light of this, i'm really curious as to hn's opinion: what do you
see as the key qualities, skills and attributes needed to keep your
hands dirty (i.e. stay focussed on hands-on work, not managerial) and
still remain extremely well-sought after and well paid? 2011-11-24 02:43:51 UTC

2519266 how do you tell nicely tell someone their requests are not in scope? okay, i swear i am not new to this but it gets me every time.<p>1. client gives requirements for software, we quote a price (hourly, not fixed price) to complete it.<p>2. client comes back with requirements that are not in scope (were listed nowhere nor mentioned anytime earlier) and only thought they would be done because ... well, he needs/wants them and assumed we'd know that because they are so important.<p>i know we are in the right, both contractually and ethically, but that all matters little if you have a really pissed off client. okay, so what are your tips for dealing with this situation?<p>the best combat may be to just bloat your estimates - like a lot - but technically we already do this just to handle give within known scope so this would be even more. plus it's not always an option when other people are estimating/trying to be competitive. and i'm dealing with a situation now where he'd pretty much blow past any reasonable buffer anyways.<p>anyways, maybe it's just always a sucky situation but i'd appreciate any tips/tricks/advice/support/encouragement my fellow hners can share.<p>thanks! 2011-05-05 23:06:55 UTC

8770973 ask hn: how do you keep your stable github repo active? perceived problem: people glance at a repo and see that it hasn&#x27;t been updated in several months.  they decide it is not actively maintained and either find a similar project that has been updated recently, or use the one they found with the worry the maintainer might not ever get back to them if they find a bug or submit a pr.<p>example: i maintain a small repo which doesn&#x27;t require many updates since the api is small and stable.  the last update was 5 months ago.  i am happy to see the random person star the project, but i don&#x27;t want future people to skip over it because it has no update activity.<p>what does everyone do to show project activity?  artificially update the readme?<p>i really want a &quot;check in&quot; button i can display in the project readme which basically says &quot;yup, the maintainer has actively been here!&quot;, assuring me that a seemingly unmaintained project is in a stable state and being watched over. 2014-12-19 03:24:08 UTC
1797394 ask hn: re-branding... any advice? the time has come to rebrand my website printingfacebook.com. the name has done me well over the past couple of weeks, but it's got to change. for one because i;m getting ready to launch more products that go beyond facebook, (but still in social network print space). also because my quick success will inevitably lead to a call from facebook's legal team. 
this was a marketing decision to launch with. i figured if i ever got big enough for facebook to notice, then i'd think about this at that time... the time came earlier than i was expecting.<p>i was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. how to smoothly streamline to a new brand identity?<p>any ideas or advice that will specifically pertain to my biz? i'll monitor here, so i can answer questions should they arise. 
you can also reach me by email if you want to get in touch more directly or privately benjaminlotan@gmail<p>thanks! 2010-10-16 05:07:36 UTC

3520379 ask hn: i'm 17. should i drop school for yc s12? i'm extremely interesting in applying to y combinator for this summer. the only problem is that i'm still in cegep (a two-year college for quebec students before they go to university - i'm 17) and so if ever i get chosen, i still have one more year remaining to complete my program (international baccalaureate in pure &#38; applied science).<p>i don't think i would drop it, because i ultimately intend to go in computer science at stanford. therefore, i would have to leave the bay area at the end of august in order to move back in quebec and stay there during the year and come back in the summer when i'm finish my program.<p>i would still have time to work on my startup during the year, but at a much lower pace (2-3 hours each night and 8-12 hours on weekends). the other guy on my team (he's 17 too) is in a much less intensive program then me and he could continue working almost full-time on the startup.<p>yet, if you guys tell me that i would absolutely need to continue working full-time on my startup, i will consider dropping school more seriously. it would be hard for me, but if it's really necessary i could do it. the thing is, the program i'm currently in, international baccalaureate, is a program that i must complete in two years. the special thing about this program is that we are the same group for every class (we started 40 now we're 28). if i drop/fail a course, i'm out. and i then need to go in regular science. if ever i were to be selected for yc, the choice would be quite hard as i said, because i really enjoy my program, i'm fond of the other students and i appreciate the teachers a lot. and i also fear that i won't go back to school if i enter the startup world.<p>at least, i'd like to finish my program and then maybe take a break from school to focus on my startup. my program requires a lot of effort, it's considerably more challenging than regular science, and i just don't see myself dropping it when i'll be halfway through it, but still there's a lot of chance i would - it's 50/50. i'm constantly debating in my head whether i should drop or stay, but i guess i'll wait to see if i'm selected for yc to make a final decision. ultimately, i feel i would drop my program, because yc is such an amazing opportunity and also because i have a very good co-founder who is a long-time friend of mine. he would definitely succeed in convincing me :p<p>moreover, i'm the only one writing code. my co-founder (who's currently studying in business management) will be working on the marketing (posting on the blog, making videos showcasing the app, posters in schools and other places, talking with other companies so that they use our app, etc.) i also have a graphic designer that will not be directly involve in the startup but that will do my logo and help me design icons, textures, etc.<p>without even knowing anything about my idea (i can tell you though that even if i'm the only technical founder, it's not an overwhelmingly complex app and i am confident that i could manage the coding alone. all features would get implemented during the summer. during the year, i would only make little changes to the user interface and update the content of the app, but i probably won’t implement radically new features, that is if i choose to stay in school. the goal during the year would be to get as much users as possible and that’s exactly what my co-founder would be working on full-time. complex new features would get implemented in the following summer.), because really i don't want to be chosen for my idea but rather for my team (i've got this interesting idea that i want to work on, and i like it because i would actually use the app, and actually, i’ve got a bunch of startup ideas (i’m the kind of guy that always has tons of ambitious projects going on and new ideas in mind: i want to code apps, make feature films and crazy edits, learn new monologues by heart, run marathons, travel around the world and learn new things!), but this particular one is not too complex to implement, yet if it turns out that i choose to do a completely different project, then so be it! anyway, i don’t think the idea i apply with matters that much (but it ought to be good obviously), because anybody could apply to yc with a similar idea and develop a similar app. but would they really be as much passionate as us about the app and as much caring about the users, would they achieve to convince companies of using it, would they convince people of using it? i know we would. my point is that i’m expecting to be chosen a lot more because of my team than because of my idea. (if you're interested to know what my app is though, email me (frabrunelle@gmail.com) or skype with me (francisbrunelle)). i want to build useful products and it thrills me that with the internet millions of people could be using them! but what thrills me even more is that if ever i do yc, i would be hanging around with dozens of other developers that are in the same situation as me. i want to discuss and debate about ideas with those developers. it would be an insanely great and enjoyable experience. and that’s exactly why i want to do yc: for the experience.), do you think i have any chance of getting selected? or should i wait for next summer, when i will have finish my program? the thing though is that i will still continue to go to school (stanford, mit, mcgill or somewhere), so again i will have the same problem as the one i have right now.<p>i truly enjoy school but the real reason i want to go in c.s. at stanford is to meet other c.s. students and start a startup with them. i'm also interested in studying in theatre, so i'm really not dropping school soon. but i don't want to wait after university to finally apply for yc, i feel ready now. the reason i want to go through yc is to meet interesting people, discuss ideas and because i'm sure it would be a tremendous experience. if i don't get chosen, i will still develop my app over the summer, but i just think yc is an outstanding opportunity and that i ought to at least submit an application. i will continue submitting applications every summer until i'm chosen.<p>p.s. as a developer, i'm not that skilled, but i always manage to figure things out by myself and find a way to do what i want. if i'm stuck, i don't easily give up. nevertheless, i'm more of an idea guy. i'm currently following tutorials from http://www.raywenderlich.com/store since december in order to get more familiar with the ios 5 sdk. when i'll finish them, i'll look at the parse sdk (http://parse.com) and then at the facebook ios sdk (https://developers.facebook.com/). i will then code an app similar to fml but it will be called "you know you're in ib when...", ib being the program i'm currently in. i will integrate the parse sdk and the facebook ios sdk in this app. it's a simple app that i want to do for testing purposes and also because i know that my other classmates would actually use it and that fact motivates me a lot. i will then start working on the real app that i want to do for my startup. my goal is to have a working app with bare minimum features for the end of may so that i have something to show if ever i move to the bay area. i'm working toward this goal 2-3 hours everyday and 8-12 hours on weekends. 2012-01-27 22:03:18 UTC

8921482 os x vs. linux? i was an avid user of linux on a thinkpad until january. i switched to a macbook pro running yosemite. was really impressed by the hardware ( great battery life and an awesome keyboard ). for a few days, osx seemed fancy too. but i really missed ubuntu with its fantastic package manager and minimalistic ui. i was being less productive by using osx. i was starting to get depressed. i made the switch by dual-booting ubuntu on my mbp. works just fine, but has heating issues ( the area around the trackpad feels warm), terrible battery life, roughly around 3 hours and occasionally the screen freezes and then i have to do a hard restart. i am going back to linux running on a thinkpad. seems like the perfect machine for development and getting things done. what do you guys think ? i am not starting a flame-war or something, i would just love to hear views on this. 2015-01-21 04:43:41 UTC
3644823 macbook air or macbook pro 15" i know this question has been asked a million times, but i do need the opinion of people who have used either of the 2 before. i currently use an aging 13" hp laptop which is overdue for a replacement. i have been eyeing the macbook and the macbook air for quite some time now. i am now so used to staring at a 13" screen so the size of the macbook air wont be an issue, the only questions i have are:
1. will i be missing something by not upgrading to a larger screen estate if i go for the macbook air?
2. will i miss the dvd burner?
3. can it handle expensive cpu operations? i.e. the air?

do i try and get more people to signup and post, stuff for sale.

2497067 app building experience + gotchas background<p>i work as a software developer in new delhi, india. since last two weeks(during my non-office hours), i have been working on reminderapp - http://reminderapp.in (i still have not launched the app). the reasons for starting the project were to learn and experiment with the lean startup concept, agile development and customer development.<p>the idea<p>a few weeks ago, i decided to start another side project (my previous project was newzupp). but this time i wanted it to generate revenue and so i started exploring various revenue generating ideas. after spending some nights validating the ideas, i finalized sms based reminder service.<p>after some brainstorming, i decided to use twilio for sms gateway and alertpay for collecting payments. i did not try them right away, which proved to be a big mistake.<p>smoke test and customer validation<p>after fixing the idea, i started coding right away (as usual). after working on it for 2 days, i lost motivation and realized the need of validating my idea. i bought a domain name ($3) and a linode server ($20). i already had a github account. i designed a simple launch page highlighting the features and posted it on hn. it climed to 3rd position and sent a lot of visitors. i also received around 50 beta signup requests along with mails appreciating the need of sms reminders. so after spending 23 dollars and 6 hours, i validated my idea.<p>coding and first shock<p>after idea validation, i planned the development phase. i planned to finish it off during the long easter weekend and launch it on monday. i was done with my dashboard design by sunday afternoon. the only thing left was twilio integration. but while upgrading my account in order to buy some phone numbers i got my first shock. twilio does not accept indian credit cards. i did not read that condition earlier. bam!!!<p>i spent the entire sunday night thinking about my next step. i even thought of dropping the plan. after thinking for some time i decided to stick with the app and started exploring other sms gateways. i found bulk sms and mediaburst. bulk sms had the best offering with rates varying from 5 cents to 8 cents. (2.5 to 4 times the twilio rates). this increased the per sms cost from 5 cents to 10 cents.<p>payment gateway integration and second shock<p>two days ago, i started integrating alertpay. the integration was fairly simple and i was able to make some dummy payments using test account.<p>yesterday, i tried to verify my account so that i can add actual payments to my site. bam!!! another shock. alertpay has some issues with mastercard ccs from india. i will have to go the phone validation and check code verification route.<p>as of today, everything but payments is working and i still have not launched.<p>lessons learnt -<p>+ validate idea as soon as possible. it motivates you to work harder.<p>+ check integration with 3rd party services before proceeding.<p>+ small things like design changes and server setup will take a lot of time. do them when you do not feel like coding. 2011-04-29 12:02:15 UTC

7153712 ask hn:  what is needed for a successful series a? a startup i&#x27;m advising just closed a successful seed round with enough funding for ~18 months of runway.  all eyes now turn towards the series a, and on figuring out where they will need to be in 6-12 months to raise a successful series a.<p>so my two questions are:<p>1.  what are the things vc&#x27;s need to see in a seed-funded company after 6-12 months of work that enable them to join (or lead) the series a round?<p>2.  are there things that typically cause a series a to fail, that vc&#x27;s see and it triggers an automatic &quot;decline&quot; decision, that we need to be careful to avoid? 2014-01-30 22:15:29 UTC

10313289 show hn: hacker news clone for books i love books!
i had once come across a great list of book recommendations on the lesswrong website (&quot;the best textbooks on every subject&quot;). but when i had stumbled upon the list a couple of years ago the last comments and recommendations on it were from 2011.
and similarly i found that most recommendations on the web suffer from this form of time decay. what i wanted was a site that had high quality recommendations similar to the lesswrong list that would feel fresh and current.
amazon was overwhelming for me since it has a gazillion books on each subject and the &quot;thanks! arrived in good condition!&quot; type of reviews drive the signal-to-noise ratio down.
so i decided to scratch my own itch with this project. it&#x27;s a bare bones mvp, shamelessly copying hn&#x27;s look-and-feel (even on mobile!)
but im hoping it will get used for quality comments and recommendations on books.
would love to get some feedback. thanks! marai2books@gmail.com or http:&#x2f;&#x2f;twitter.com&#x2f;vivalabooks1<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.vivalabooks.com 2015-10-01 18:14:24 UTC

6437607 ask hn: most regrettable design decision in computer industry? i think that there is a type of design decision that cause a lot of trouble and trivial benefit.
if designers had been aware of problems, the world would have saved tons of time and money.<p>for example:<p>big-endian and little-endian:<p>the difference of endian forces developers to be careful of target architecture.
if early processor vendors had communicated and established which is the standard, there would have been less trouble and no need to invent byte order mark(bom).<p>32bit ip address:<p>of course it is difficult to judge how many devices will be in the world, but sometimes i have an uneasy feeling about shifting to ipv6. i think that the industry will experience confusion and need to devote much effort than we think.<p>what do you think is most regrettable design decision in computer industry? 2013-09-24 13:09:45 UTC

7746042 ask hn: are solo founders as screwed as they're led to believe? as it is i&#x27;m looking at becoming a solo founder for an app-based venture. it just happens that all of my friends are liberal artsy people, and the couple programmers i know are happily buried in corporate culture.<p>i&#x27;ve heard over and over that co-founders who lack a connection and strong history don&#x27;t do well in the long run, and it makes sense, so i&#x27;m hesitant to just go co-founder shopping at tech meetups. and anyway, at this point, i would be hesitant to bring someone on board with equal share when i&#x27;ve developed the entire business plan and written the initial app myself. i would happily hire employees and give them relatively small share, but like so many others i&#x27;m just very new to all this.<p>how do you hire your first employee as a solo founder without giving them 50% of your venture? 2014-05-14 20:08:07 UTC
2139145 ask hn: how do you politely decline a project? i've quoted a project to a client (a nonprofit professional organization). it's a rescue mission - they paid a previous developer a nominal fee to build a web application, and many pieces no longer work due to changes in program language versions on the shared host.<p>i provided a few options, including leaving things as-is but moving to a different host with versions of the libraries that work with the app, or simply paying my non-profit client hourly rate to fix the problems.<p>they said my estimate was too high, and now they want to meet to discuss the requirements and cost. i'm not really interested in negotiating my rate on this project because i don't need the work, i'm already charging a lower rate because they are a true nonprofit, and whenever haggling over rates comes up this early, i know that collecting my fee is going to be difficult no matter what i charge.<p>but i'm also not interested in coming off like an arrogant jerk. so, any advice? interested to hear how you politely walk away from deals.<p>[edited for formatting] 2011-01-25 14:36:42 UTC

1553163 ask hn: what to do about "grand ideas" in fields you have no expertise in? assume you have a great idea in a field you have no expertise in.<p>of course, almost all people who are in this situation really don't have a great idea, but for the sake of this thread, let's assume that the idea is indeed great.<p>that is, great in the sense that if people with expertise and a proven track record in the field, and with connections in the industry, and with a lot of hard work, etc, could turn into something valuable.<p>e.g. a dentist having the idea for tivo years before tivo was out, or a computer programmer coming up with a design for a better propeller for oil tankers.<p>it seems to me that there is almost nothing you can do in this situation. breaking into the tv/entertainment business, or the oil tanker business, or similar large industries is close to impossible for outsiders with no expertise in the field.<p>on the other end of the spectrum, i'm always fascinated by how easy it is for people within a field to test even half-baked ideas. a simple example is on the show survivor, when the host once said that his niece had an idea for a challenge for the players, and the survivor crew put it together and it was on the next episode. an outsider to the show and/or the industry would likely have to have a huge compelling case and do a lot of hard work before they even listen to his idea for the show.<p>this imbalance (for insiders and outsiders) is large and could be leading us to miss out on some great stuff in various fields.<p>some questions for you guys:<p>1) is it as impossible to do anything about ideas in fields you have no expertise in as i think it is?<p>2) are we as a society losing out on some great or at least useful innovations because as society is currently set up, it doesn't facilitate cross-discipline (outsider) idea dissemination?<p>3) if the answers to the above are 'yes', is there anything that can be done to change this?<p>4) is my premise wrong? am i missing something?<p>(i should note that i can see that most ideas coming from people outside a particular field are useless, have been done before, are impractical, etc, but i think there may be a tiny minority that could prove useful in the right hands) 2010-07-28 00:27:21 UTC

97829 ask yc: how do you work for 8 hours straight? i currently consider taking on another job, but to be honest, i am a bit daunted by the prospect of working 8 hours straight, every day. i have times when i work more, when i get into the flow, but what if i don't? recently i have read more than once in popular blogs that 2-3 hours of real work per day are more realistic.<p>in previous jobs, i found 8 hours very hard to do. maybe it is only my problem because i frequently don't sleep very well and on some days am almost too tired to work. no idea how other people consistently pull 60h work weeks, though. except perhaps if most of the time is spent in meetings, which is not so taxing (many people doing overtime seem to be managers or team leaders, which might indicate many meetings).<p>also, in all previous jobs i ended up surfing the internet a lot. i don't really like that, though - i want to give employers their money's worth. or do i just have the wrong attitude towards employment?<p>i suspect surfing the internet is a bit like coffee, news sites are small little excitement spikes for the brain. but maybe i am addicted, and they say coffee makes you more nervous and less able to show consistent performance over an extended period of time. so perhaps if i could wean of the news while at work, working 8 hours would become possible? or would my brain deteriorate completely (i should add that i usually work as a java developer).<p>edit: one thing i liked about consulting and billing by the hour is that at least if i went home early, i would just charge the client less, so i did not have to feel too bad about it. maybe i am just not cut out for regular employment? 2008-01-13 12:22:03 UTC

9050343 google deleted whocalled.us for “pure spam” and replaced it with spam in november google completely removed whocalled.us from their search results.<p>it was the first site of its kind, created in 2005 for crowdsourced info about telemarketing numbers. there were scripts for people to utilize in their voip boxes, and it was a good honest site.<p>google has been trying to weed out telephone spam in their results, and for some reason they deleted the original instead of the useless empty shell sites that spam every possible telephone number combination.<p>if i search &quot;whocalled.us&quot; on google now i see #1 the google+ page for the site, and #2 a wordpress spam page. they deleted whocalled.us with a &quot;pure spam&quot; manual action, and literally replaced it with <i>pure spam</i>.<p>whocalled.us has never used spam tactics. that is why copycats quickly beat it in terms of traffic. the first competitor used spammy seo techniques, and is often the #1 result now for telephone number searches.<p>i&#x27;ve been making websites since before google existed, and it feels like my ways are going extinct. prior to this &quot;pure spam&quot; removal, there was a partial action for unnatural links. i was shocked that a search engine sent me a notice that my website would be penalized unless i contacted other websites to have them remove links to my site. remove links? that is the whole point of the web!<p>it included some suggestions of &quot;spam&quot; sites with links to mine, and when i clicked one i saw someone&#x27;s personal blog with some links to their favorite sites. i don&#x27;t know what world this is, where a search engine tells a webmaster they need to contact a small-time blog owner to have them remove a link recommending your site, but it&#x27;s not mine.<p>to me this is still the world wide web, where little guys like me can play on the same field as global giants. but in reality, this is google&#x27;s game now, and when they kick you off their field, there&#x27;s not much to do but sulk and go home. 2015-02-14 18:31:36 UTC

4038573 ask hn: crowdfunded change to a non-viral license for the next software release disclaimer: not a software developer.<p>crowdfunded projects are getting more and more popular [1]: it is easy, fun, and profitable (hopefully, anyway). on the other hand, there is a license-dependence success rate of the "open"-source projects (e.g. [2]).
thus, my questions is:<p>is it possible for software vendors to release a particular release version of their product under certain license, if crowdfunded capital goal is achieved?<p>as an example let’s take a well-documented case of bash* [3]. following my question, could bash dev-team release their next version (let’s say bash-4.3) under not viral open source license (e.g. (simplified) bsd [4]), so that bash could be incorporated in the commercial products.
both parts would benefit in this case: business will get (newer) version of the product under convenient license, dev-team will get funding for continuous developing of the product.<p>thanks for you time.<p>* i understand that because of the affiliation of bash to fsf this will never happen.<p>[1] http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/08/crowdfunding-state-of-the-union/<p>[2] http://blog.opalang.org/2012/05/opa-license-change-not-just-agpl.html<p>[3] http://meta.ath0.com/2012/02/05/apples-great-gpl-purge/

3215713 ask hn: how do you tackle with family distractions? i am not a "professional" entrepreneur but i am sure a techie and a bit hustler. all i know my plate is full with a few things which i started perusing as well and with great interest. my scattered mind had started getting focused on few things. hn made a huge effort to make changes in my life. things were looking cool then all of a sudden things changed(or appear to get changed).<p>a couple of days back i scolded my infant son. naturally my parents defended my son so my sister and wife. this led to a useless debate with them and a huge fight with wife. she said things which hurt me a lot and made me to change plan; from working my own things to move out of my country(pakistan) to somewhere out so that i can just go away from them start a new career as a employee. i know it sounds weird but it's just i want to run away from my current environment which is not being helpful for me. i can't convince my family either about my ambitions because they will not get it either. my wife understands me but the last fight really put me off and gave me feeling that nobody is with me.<p>i really dont want to leave my country, specially for job purpose but i feel i need to because: 1) to make my family believe that i am not some useless freak 2)to earn more money.<p>situations distracting me from being an entrepreneur to staying as a job guy. what should i do?<p>do guide me. 2011-11-09 15:11:14 UTC

9777940 ask hn: are there any realistic corporate cloud data storage solutions? hello hacker new, i&#x27;ve been on a quest to find a corporate cloud data storage platform for over a year now, and have yet to come up with anything that fully meets an enterprises needs. here is a list of what a true solution needs, anyone know of a company that i do not?<p>centralized file storage not tied to any one user, but to the company account.<p>admin controls over folder permissions, regardless of who uploaded the folder&#x2f;files<p>individual file vesioning. most providers have this.<p>folder level versioning to allow an entire folder to get rolled back to a previous version, instead of each file individually.<p>functional lan syncing between clients on a local network in order to avoid massive bandwidth usage on active accounts.<p>file locking! this seems to be the achilles heel to cloud storage? i can&#x27;t believe a company would roll out a product as enterprise ready without file locking. we use to have a cloud storage provider who had file locking, and it worked great for us, however they took the feature out because it caused problems for other clients.<p>no maximum file limit, size limits are ok if we have the ability to purchase additional storage, but onedrive for business has a 20000 item limit per site, and a 5000 limit per subsite. meaning nearly every one of my clients cannot use onedrive for business.<p>please hn, help me find something that works! 2015-06-25 14:06:39 UTC

9567139 ask hn: side project for extra income question? this is not a new idea, will never be a venture funded startup, and is unlikely to change the direction of my life - it&#x27;s quite simple &amp; straightforward and that&#x27;s the beauty in it: create a better trail mix and sell it online.<p>there are a number of uncertainties, mainly will the market accept my &#x27;better&#x27; trail mix and if not manufactured at scale can i actually make money - those are to be determined though.<p>my question to the community is: what is the cheapest way to have an mvp for a consumer packaged good like trail mix? say 500 12oz units. i&#x27;m unable (i believe) to package in my garage due to food quality and control restrictions - so are there companies that would accept the empty bags with my design + raw ingredients and package the trail mix for me to then sell?<p>any advice&#x2f;help would be appreciated. thanks! 2015-05-18 22:09:36 UTC
3815144 ask hn: how did you find a quality freelance designer? hi hn, a couple of us have been working on a project, and we would like to find a freelance designer who could work on the ui/ux. i know this is a common request on hn, but hear me out.<p>i don't like the idea of something like 99 designs/crowdspring, because i don't want to have 98 more people spend time working on something that they are not going to be paid for. as much as i like the idea of having choices, this really is not something i would do myself if i were a decent designer...certainly won't
do it as a programmer.<p>although money is tight, i am not looking to short-change designers either. i probably can afford to pay 2x or 3x of what projects cost on those sites, but that would be it for a while as a bootstrapped startup. and i am not looking for a 'unicorn' do-it-all either.<p>on the other hand, i have not met my 'go-to' designer in 3rd grade, and i don't have a network of designers to fall back on.<p>how have you done it successfully? if you didn't have a designer co-founder, how did you find a quality freelance/contract designer? 2012-04-08 22:46:21 UTC

3214730 ask hn: list creation and sharing hey hn. do any of you remember what path was rumored to have been doing before the whole photo-sharing thing?<p>http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/first_peek_at_pathio_the_stealth_startup_from_face.php<p>it was supposedly something along the lines of list creation. now, i don't know about the rest of you, but i was actually super excited about this, because i really wanted an app that i could use to make, share, and collaborate on lists. seems trivial, but i thought it was awesome.<p>even now i can't seem to let it go. so i'm asking you hners, do you know of any apps that do this really well? i'm not talking about todo-list apps, i know tons of though. i'm talking about a single unified interface that allows me to easily and quickly create lists (of any kind, with any sort of content), and be able to share them live with friends, and allow friends to edit them. 2011-11-09 08:02:50 UTC

3041416 ask hn: opinion on wsgr (lawyers) this is a throwaway account. i'm a regular hn user with 3 years of activity, please bear with me on this anonymous post.<p>we're currently in process of incorporating our company (a c-corp) and got a recommendation from a fellow entrepreneur regarding one law firm we should use called "wilson sonsini" (wsgr - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilson_sonsini_goodrich_%26_rosati). after talking to them, the impression we get is they're very expensive (e.g. charging 5k just for the incorporation - which can be deferred for 1 year, however). they also take around 1% in equity. the other option we have is a less expensive/famous lawyer (of course we could also go solo, but we'd rather pay to have everything 100%, so "no lawyer" is not an option we'd like to explore).<p>so i'm writing this to know whether anyone knows about these guys, have any opinion on their practice, know if it helps to go for really expensive guys like these in an early stage (we're currently looking to raise a seed round for our 1-year-old, not yet profitable startup). one thing i hear is that these kinds of firms can help making connections (even finding an investor), but that sounds more like marketing than a fact to me.<p>does anyone have an experience to share? any thoughts would be highly appreciated. we don't want to overspend in an area that would bring us no benefits, but we also don't want to underspend just for the sake of saving a couple thousand dollars... 2011-09-27 01:27:18 UTC

9343263 the painful journey of painless deployments as a developer you are usually more concerned about writing software. you might even experience joy when testing software. but deploying software is another story.<p>when you don&#x27;t have the luxury of an experienced dev ops team, chances are that you as a developer might have to take matters into your own hand and deploy your software. and all of a sudden you&#x27;ll be the dev ops guy, cause you are spending more time deploying than actually developing software. what a nightmare!<p>unfortunately this turned out to be true for my team. that&#x27;s obviously not a good situation, especially when you&#x27;re a small dev team:<p>- 1 cto

859885 ask hn: how much of your personal life did you have to give up for your startup? perhaps this shows that i don't want my own business enough, but one of my biggest concerns is that i won't have time to see friends or enjoy any hobbies (or read hn!) any more. is it really true you end up with zero personal life, and if so, for how long? i understand it varies greatly from founder to founder, but i'm still curious. 2009-10-04 09:29:11 UTC

4991474 the velocity of a bullet fired from the back of a train this is from an issue of the american magazine.  is it true?<p>15. if a man is standing on the back platform of a railroad train which is traveling at the rate of sixty miles an hour, and fires a bullet in the direction from which the train came, and the powder back of it is capable of driving the bullet sixty miles an hour, what will happen to the bullet?<p>the velocity at which the bullet, as part of the train, is traveling, will be overcome by the force given it by exploding the powder, operating in the opposite direction, and it will drop to the ground. 2013-01-01 00:40:55 UTC
3870492 ask hn: anyone interested in judging a coding competition in central california? i am participating in a coding competition called 59daysofcode in fresno, california and i understand that they are still looking for some qualified judges.<p>you can check them out at www.59daysofcode.com. 2012-04-21 01:15:33 UTC
4838148 ask hn: question regarding non-technical cofounder let me start by saying i love the community here and have always found ask/show hn threads some of the most informative.<p>i got the standard approach a few days ago: an acquaintance with zero technical ability (who actually said he's "not good with the computer codes") approached me regarding something i should build in a field of shared interest which is ripe for technical disruption.<p>what surprised me is that it's actually a really good idea, and i could see it being a viable business - not the next big thing, maybe not even a startup by traditional hn definitions (there would never be massive, viral growth), but i could definitely see it supporting a small staff if executed properly.<p>here's my question: i could build it, but i don't know what this prospective cofounder would <i>do</i>. he's not a salesman, he's no more of a domain expert in this field than i am, and he's not a business guy (cpa/forensic accountant by trade); he's only marginally better connected than i am in the field as well. that being said, is there some vital function i'm missing out on? how can i vet him without just coming out and saying "what good are you?" 2012-11-27 18:52:02 UTC
5607197 are javascript frameworks suitable for content websites mv* javascript frameworks are the latest craze in website development but are they really more suited to app development rather than content heavy websites such as bbc.co.uk or guardian.co.uk? is that approach plain wrong for that type of project, if so which approach is better suited? 2013-04-25 14:03:21 UTC

9178304 ask hn: have you made a movie? 	hey hn. i&#x27;m producing my second feature, called at sunrise, right now. the first one we crowdfunded for about $10k. does anyone have experience in producing along more conventional routes?
we&#x27;ve raised about $70k of in-kind contributions and $15k of cash but need $30k more. there aren&#x27;t a lot of film angels in my state (michigan). we&#x27;ve built a great roi case for the movie, assembled the cast, begun rehearsals, secured a location, but we&#x27;re still struggling to close our financing. any advice?<p>if you&#x27;d like to see a reel from our first movie, you can email me at jordan at birnholtz dot com. i&#x27;d be happy to show it to you! i&#x27;d post but it but we&#x27;re keeping it (more or less) private until this festival season is over.<p>thanks a bunch, hn. 2015-03-10 15:42:10 UTC

3747029 figuring out keystroke-input modification for a newly disabled family member a young family member just came out of a 2 month-long coma after being blindsided by a geriatric driver.  she has significant brain damage, which has introduced a huge "shake" into the movements of the one arm/hand she can control.  she's not expected to get better in that regard.<p>she keeps trying to use keyboards &#38; tablets, but due to her limited motor control, she cannot effectively type, which seriously frustrates her.  basically, she hits the key she wants too many times, along with a "constellation" of the keys around the target.<p>i'm wondering if there is a programmatic solution to this that would allow her to type.<p>my conceptualization of the problem is that the program would need to buffer all of the keystrokes coming in, and "screen" them by assuming for a character to actually be accepted as input, it must be his a certain number of times (i.e. and adjustable threshold).  basically, imagine that if, while brain-damaged, you want to type  "hi", you're going to hit the constellation of keys around the "h" key n times, but fewer than the number of times you successfully land on the "h" itself.  repeat with "i".  the output looks something like "ughhjyhyhhhhh" and "uiuioiiioi".<p>i feel like you could try and measure a user's individual keystrike accuracy through a few trials of typing something like our above "hi", which would then adjust thresholds appropriately, allowing other programs to ignore the mistakenly pressed keys.  you could give the user a sort of customized "landing pad" where they need to hit their choice key somewhere between, say, 4-7 times before it actually registers, which would screen out all of the others key that get accidentally pressed in the attempt.<p>once a character gets accepted as intentionally struck, clear buffer and continue.<p>this leads to my questions:<p>1) is this possible?<p>2) how difficult would it be to implement on a laptop or tablet (no os preference).<p>3) does this seem like the best way to go about solving this problem (user cannot accurately strike keys), or am i overcomplicating it?<p>thank you.<p>additional disclosures: i'm a weak programmer (basic python, basic java), and have never written anything that didn't stand by itself (i.e. no os interfaces, hooking, etc).  i'm way out of my depth -- i just want to help give her back some quality of life.  also, she can't speak right now, so voice recognition is out. 2012-03-23 20:17:46 UTC

8137885 get paid to type captcha's http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.megatypers.com&#x2f;<p>note: this is not my site. i&#x27;m posting this here in the hopes of generating discussion about a pretty important topic.<p>a few sites exist specifically for breaking captcha&#x27;s. these are known as &quot;captcha farms&quot; [1][2]. you can find a bunch of them on google, but a few examples are deathbycaptcha [3] and imagedecoders [4]. these two sites charge about $1.35 per 1000 solved captcha&#x27;s.<p>this is a relatively well known industry, but most of the articles i&#x27;ve seen only talk about the <i>demand</i> side of the market. nobody has bothered to find the sites paying the suppliers to type the captcha&#x27;s. so today i did a little bit of research and was able to find one.<p>megatypers [5] pays its users to solve captcha&#x27;s. signing up is kind of difficult because you need to track down an invitation code, so i took some screenshots and put them in an album for anyone interested, including pricing table, captcha entry, and statistics board. [6]<p>when typing captcha&#x27;s, i was limited by the speed they were offered to me (hence the ability to buy &quot;boost packs,&quot; i presume). in 60 seconds, i was able to type 12 captcha&#x27;s, 11 of them accurately. assuming i sustained this rate for an hour, i would type roughly 700 captcha&#x27;s.<p>assuming average price of $0.65&#x2f;1000 (it varies by hour), i would earn 45 cents. in an 8 hour day, that&#x27;s $3.60.<p>captcha farms are making a profit of roughly $500 per day.<p>i&#x27;m wondering: what does the (largely libertarian) userbase of hn think of this?<p>note: i ran into the character limit, so will post more in a comment.<p>[1] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.nytimes.com&#x2f;2010&#x2f;04&#x2f;26&#x2f;technology&#x2f;26captcha.html?_r=0<p>[2] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;arstechnica.com&#x2f;security&#x2f;2008&#x2f;09&#x2f;captchas-flummox-bots-but-may-be-doomed-by-captcha-farmers&#x2f;<p>[3] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;deathbycaptcha.com&#x2f;<p>[4] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.imagedecoders.com<p>[5] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.megatypers.com&#x2f;<p>[6] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;imgur.com&#x2f;a&#x2f;qevoc<p>[7] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;en.wikipedia.org&#x2f;wiki&#x2f;list_of_minimum_wages_by_country 2014-08-05 16:51:54 UTC

1501281 ask hn: does this idea have any potential ? i created one site while learning flex and just put it up online at www.yawtv.com , i know the ui sucks but first come first i want to know does online video sites have any potential to make money without facing any copyright issues (specially when you are just an independent developer and your site is based on youtube).i also wanted to extend this idea hence started making http://www.yawtv.com/twittertv/twittertv_fs.swf (still developing this so has lotsa bugs).i read about what happened to totlol.com (at one point it was generating lots of traffic), sites like them have lots of potential i think.consider this if i collect all the yoga videos or how to videos and create a channel dedicated to that with videos well categorized then i am sure it will generate traffic but how to make money from it as youtube won't allow to put ads if nothing else is there on the page.
please give suggestions and how i can improve this site or this idea or change it altogether. 2010-07-09 16:57:46 UTC

2071662 ask hn: is there a place for content management on mobile? while just walking between my lappy and a hair cut that almost ripped my scalp off, i was wondering about the web and mobile apps, how there are numerous cms systems for easy content management that allow technical and non-technical people to get content on the web, from blogs to simple personal and corporate websites (let's say "mom and dad businesses").<p>then i started to wonder if there was a place on the mobile app space for content management. although i haven't yet exactly been able to almost point my finger on what it means, i was thinking about something along the lines of allowing (easy) content editing (from non-developers) that would be deployed as an mobile app and would be accessible off-line (since it's already possible to get content on the mobile at least through the browser).<p>am i making any sense?<p>edit: typo 2011-01-05 17:39:18 UTC

7575707 ask hn: jobs after startup flop over the last couple years i&#x27;ve launched a few startups, each of which failed in relatively quick succession. everything was bootstrapped (although we did interview with techstars) and i&#x27;m left in a pretty dire financial situation. i&#x27;m still working on one of the projects and keeping it alive on credit which isn&#x27;t sustainable for much longer, unless we&#x27;re somehow accepted to yc.<p>so to regroup and dig out of this hole, i&#x27;m in the unenviable position of looking for gainful employment after a string of failures. while i&#x27;d like to find a role where i can keep learning so that i&#x27;m a better founder next time, getting some cash is the first priority. i&#x27;m also not sure what sort of jobs i&#x27;m qualified for... like many founders i did a bit of everything so my skillset is more broad than deep. i built the tech for my startups (crud apps, nothing fancy) and am about 2 chapters through sicp, but i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;m advanced&#x2f;skilled enough for a software engineering position in the valley.<p>before the startups i was an i-banking analyst at gs&#x2f;jpm&#x2f;ms and i passed all the cfa exams. so on paper that&#x27;s an option, although what i&#x27;ve been doing the past couple years is so far off the finance radar that i&#x27;m probably entirely unemployable on wall street. and the expectation of being at the office 80+ hours per week would seriously limit my ability to hack on stuff and explore new startup ideas on the side.<p>i was almost able to use an mba (i know, sorry) as an escape hatch to regroup and figure things out but, after interviewing with hbs, i was waitlisted and eventually rejected so that&#x27;s off the list.<p>any ideas on where i should be looking or how to approach this? i&#x27;m likely to jump back into startups as soon as my financial situation stabilizes so length of employment is another thing for me to consider - i don&#x27;t want to leave anyone in a bind. 2014-04-11 21:23:13 UTC

2765794 ask hn: established developer with no cs experience looking to catch up hi hn!<p>i've been an avid spectator here for about a year now and wanted to start by thanking everyone here for keeping me up to date on the latest and providing a source for me to read intelligent discussion on the things i care about.<p>as a bit of backstory, i got into computing when i was about 12 years old and programming shortly thereafter. i never accomplished much, but i learned the fundamentals as i bounced from vb6 to c++ to c# to java to php and eventually found ruby whilst serving a tour of duty in iraq a couple years ago. i was going to attend school after i returned and get a cs degree, but something much more wonderful happened that prevented me from doing so.<p>one day while i was in iraq, i read a blog post written by someone who would become one of the most influential figures in my life that had a profound impact on the way i went about doing my hobby projects. i emailed him directly to express my gratitude, and to my surprise he responded! we continued to correspond during the remainder of my time overseas, and i worked on a small rails project that he had the idea for but never the time to do.<p>shortly after i returned home, he proposed one day that instead of going back to stocking shelves at wal-mart as i had originally intended to do when i got back, that i come work for his consulting company as an intern, with the potential for a salary offer sometime down the road. midway through the year and i was a full salaried employee working for a respected consulting firm, which was more than i could have come to expect in my wildest dreams. our firm was acquired by a hot startup earlier this year, and i'm now still doing my dream job in the company of some of the most amazing people i've ever met.<p>one thing has been itching at the back of my mind ever since last year though, and that's my tremendous lack of knowledge when it comes to cs fundamentals. algorithms. data structures. math. these are things that i see most people in my field around me excel at, and i often find myself stumped at the what would seem to be the most trivial problems when it comes to them.<p>so today i decided that i am once again going to try my hand at seeking the advice of people who are way smarter than me in the hopes that something profound will happen.<p>what can i do now that i already have the career of my dreams, with no time for school, to gain the basic cs knowledge that i find myself lacking in? 2011-07-15 00:29:15 UTC

381986 ask hn: which functional language to implement for learning? they say the best way to learn about things is to just go and implement it. that being said, i'm looking to implement an interpreter (or maybe a vm and compiler) for a functional language to enforce the ideas i've learned in the past few months.<p>in the past, i've written interpreters for a few basic languages and scheme (not fully r4rs compliant, but close enough to learn what i wanted). of course, i wrote these in languages that provided garbage collection, and without any type-checking. basically as ast-walkers.<p>i want to establish more expertise with these topics and create something that i can actually use, maybe even extend, but to build a new language from scratch and make real design decisions isn't in my cards yet.<p>so, the question, does anyone know of language specifications for functional languages that aren't entirely crippled that would be interesting to implement as a learning project?<p>please don't suggest scheme. i love scheme, but it's been done to death, and is the language i've studied the inner-workings of the most. thanks. 2008-12-01 19:25:28 UTC

4160883 ask hn: store password - no hash, but aes it's just an idea....what's your opinion?<p>instead of using md5 and similar (too fast to calculate, and rainbow tables attack too - if not salted) my idea is:<p>-create a cleartext (even public);
-use the password you want to store to encrypt this text, using aes256 for example;
-save the encrypted text;<p>verify your password (on user input) encrypting the clear text and checking if it matches with stored encrypted password.<p>pros:
-it's more slow to calculate (and so less easy to brute force)
-being the cleartext different on each "server" there's now way to have a rainbow table!<p>opinions?

1783988 an idea for how to store ratings i am putting a "rating" field in one of my tables, and i figured out a good way to store them: decimal(10,9) in mysql, but more generally, as a fraction that goes from -1 to 1.<p>why not 1 to 5 or some other value?<p>two main reasons:
a) -1 to 1 is a normalized range that you can scale to anything easily<p>b) a non-vote counts as a middle-of the range vote. that's really cool.<p>so that means people who don't vote are the same as people who vote right in the middle, and so you only have to store a total participant count rather than an additional voter_count. this system seems to make for fair ratings that can be compared between items. what do you think?<p>ps: how about storing decimal(10, 10) so no one has a perfect -1 or perfect 1 rating ever? you'll get 1 more digit of precision that way. 2010-10-12 16:45:53 UTC

6792576 ask hn: reversible expressiveness of programming languages? i have used many different programming languages from different paradigm, and all of them talks about how expressive they are, etc. i had this thought that the expressiveness of all these languages is in only one direction i.e from your thoughts to the code and the reverse of that - from code back to thoughts - takes around same amount of effort in all languages and this is really disappointing and leads to the use of alternate tools like documentation, comments etc. it may be possible to easily understand a specific part of the whole code base but that is no where near the whole picture of the system and what thoughts exactly were used to design the system. also, we all know that code is read more than it is written.<p>would like to know what people think about it. 2013-11-25 05:01:34 UTC

6569807 the curious case of customer validation you have a killer idea, say a brain implant that functions as a telepathic device.<p>you&#x27;ve figured out the logistics, you need a billion dollars to develop the prototype and cover overheads, legal issues and other crazy stuff.<p>and now you need the validation, will the average joe sign up to have his head bust open and pay a ridiculous fee to have this implanted ?<p>how do you find customers? do they really need this? is this really a practical solution? will they pay for it?
for some this part might be simple, for others not so much (including myself, thats why i&#x27;m writing this post :o).<p>too many startups begin with an idea for a product that they think people want. 
they then spend months, sometimes years, perfecting that product without ever showing the product, 
even in a very rudimentary form, to the prospective customer. when they fail to reach broad uptake 
from customers, it is often because they never spoke to prospective customers and determined whether 
or not the product was interesting. when customers ultimately communicate, through their indifference, 
that they don&#x27;t care about the idea, the startup fails.   - http:&#x2f;&#x2f;theleanstartup.com&#x2f;principles<p>head over to<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;shipquick.co<p>for a simple solution to this issue of customer validation. validate quicker to ship you idea quicker.<p>even i am validating this problem right now !<p>cheers. 2013-10-18 04:41:58 UTC

(sign up at www.secfirst.org - sorry for the blatant plug :). however we want to avoid organisations from making a commercial profit from or publishing their versions of software under our name. basically to reduce people who might want to stick a back door into the software and then upload it elsewhere and&#x2f;or build the source into their own for profit software. of course, if they were using some of the source for nonprofit software then thats great :)&lt;p&gt;any thoughts would be appreciated. 2013-12-09 09:20:57 UTC

10231417 ask hn: what am i doing wrong or where is the fail? on tuesday, i had what i thought was a decent interview. 1 manager type, 5 devs. it lasted about an hour. this is response i got:<p>“the interview with chad did not go well. he seems like a good guy but he is carrying some anger from past jobs &#x2f; experiences and it came across in the interview. for example: we asked him how he handled a tough code&#x2f;development problem in the past. the answer we were looking for is something along the lines of - i used one of the coding forums, i used google, etc, etc. chad&#x27;s response was that his recent problems were not code related, but rather issues with the business side, company owners, etc.<p>i hope this feedback will help chad in future interviews. his skill set seemed rather solid, but his attitude would not be a good fit for us.”<p>i&#x27;m confused, because one question killed the whole interview? yes, i&#x27;m a good guy, with a dash of funny. (i honestly, work at being a good person, might have something to do with the number 12, only 10% will understand that little easter egg.) my skill set is good especially in what they where looking for. i will admit that i am a little bitter about my previous job, as it was a start up and a lot wasted energy went into the process, but it surely wasn&#x27;t enough to tilt an interview or maybe it was. i will be writing about that experience real soon.<p>it&#x27;s frustrating, but i guess it could always be worse...<p>by the way, i&#x27;m still looking for work.<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.strategic-options.com&#x2f;resume?=askhn 2015-09-17 03:28:12 UTC
11138 what is your opinion guys on start a web service startup in russia? google and yahoo are there. are you?   2007-04-10 05:45:46 UTC
10023127 would you be our consultnt for the next 5 min? hi guys,
we thought we should try and get some fresh ideas about our side project , refreshbox.co, we feel that we might not think enough out of the box enough. refreshbox is a destination platform which enables people to subscribe or create a 5-link-collection newsletter consisting their weekly professional best read (curate content). it&#x27;s a newsletter platform (not just a tool like mailchimp) and it&#x27;s important for us that it will be a two way street newsletter. the most important things for our curators, those who launched their own newsletters, are subscribers and engagement with their subscribers. when a subscriber gets a newsletter he can: 
1. rate and comment on the newsletter
2. comment on the links.
3. open and click rate.
there is a notification sent to the curator when one of these happen. 
my question to you is: what additional ideas do you have to create engagement between the curators and subscribers? try to think out of the box. an idea i had is to give subscribers an option to donate to an organization related to the domain of the newsletter if they liked the links they got. that way the curator can see how much money people donated because of the links he curated. maybe it&#x27;s not the best idea...what are your ides? thanks a lot! 2015-08-07 15:47:12 UTC

4742678 the reasonableness of hn job postings as i was reading a job opening just tonight on the front page of hn it occurred to me the massive contrast between job offerings from elite ycombinator companies vs the vast majority of other developer/programming and it job postings i run into virtually anywhere else. the hn postings, though clearly looking for a-listers, sound reasonable, whereas the majority of listings elsewhere are consistently on the verge of, or downright, laughable.<p>i'm really a noob in programming. the closest to an 'official' tech job i've had, as of yet, is tech support for a proprietary access based application. but even for one so unversed as i am it's obvious as the noon day sun the disconnect between those who know what they are looking for and those who are just shooting for some generic delusion of a star developer. 2012-11-05 08:09:51 UTC

5644649 are there good hn-like forums for discussing sexism, racism, and the like? i have observed that posts about sexism and racism draw a lot of upvotes, but also a lot of flags, and are considered to be off topic by many.<p>fair enough. do hn readers know of any websites with hn-style discussion of these issues?<p>there are many forums about feminism, but most of them seem to double as "safe spaces" where posters would like to vent about negative experiences to a sympathetic audience. for the most part, debate and dissent seem unwelcome.<p>i wish to respect the guidelines of such sites, which probably means not participating. however i would like to find a good venue for such discussions, where all points of view are welcome, where civility is expected, and where debate, discussion, disagreement, and the sharing of different experiences are the norm. does anyone know of one?<p>thank you. 2013-05-02 14:29:32 UTC

3012146 ask hn: explaining how programmers work to non-programmer workplace? i am the first on-site programmer and i find it super hard to get any significant programming work done during the working hours on weekdays. this is mainly due to the physical office setup(open, non-quiet office) and folks needing something from me or having a question at least once an hour.<p>so, what do i do? we have a bunch of offshore devs and i sit next to the pms. i am able to offer advice in terms of prioritizing features etc. and doing the management part of my job.<p>however, the coding part of my job(at least 50%), i can rarely do anything that involves even tiniest of problem solving. i am left mostly to do quick 5 minute fixes or copy edits.<p>the real coding? i do it over the weekend. i just pushed a tiny feature that took me 45 minutes. i spent five scattered hours on friday on the same thing making zero progress.<p>ideas? solutions? i already tried proposing to my boss(the ceo) to let me play with my hours and work evenings but he felt i should be around the office when others are. 2011-09-19 03:46:33 UTC

2225870 how legal are game clones? hi,
i know a game available for pc and iphone. it's not even a very recent game, however there isn't any online and/or facebook version of it. imho, the concept has a huge potential for social gaming.
question is, how legal is if i was to do clone of the game, extend to be a social game and publish it on facebook? 2011-02-16 10:11:55 UTC

4035429 ask hn: what sort of startup talk is allowed at work? i was talking to some business friends of mine, and they were very dumbfounded about the claims that companies make about employee side projects.<p>to what degree am i allowed to focus on my startup at work? i never write code, but i do ask technical questions on freenode about setups and favorites ycombinator articles.<p>am i being paranoid? i'm just worried, because i run a blog under the same nick (not this one), and any competent googler will show me asking questions at work pertinent to my startup.<p>probably a stupid question, but i'd really appreciate any links/knowledge drops. i think i'm being paranoid, but i don't know. 2012-05-29 00:01:30 UTC
5881549 ask hn: is there marketplace for writers? while i can write english ok, but i think i would like to leave it to the pro writers to do it.  i need it to write the content of my site such as faq, about us, how it works, etc.<p>the only marketplace i found is scripted.com but it&#x27;s not that user friendly, in my opinion.<p>i could go on in odesk, freelancer, elance but there are more of developers instead of writers.<p>just curious if there are any other options to look at.<p>thanks. 2013-06-14 18:29:12 UTC

752213 ask hn: my y combinator dissertation and startup survey i'm currently writing my master's dissertation on y combinator and all of the new "startup incubators" (for lack of a better term) that have cropped up in the last few years.  i believe that many of the programs have simply copied y combinator, and that there is a lot more innovation left.<p>my goal is to get some data on the programs thus far, detail why startups want to be a part of these programs, and detail why people want to start these programs.  i hope to put all of this together in a framework for structuring new incubator programs.<p>my blog post describing everything so far is here:<p>http://blog.jedchristiansen.com/2009/08/10/y-combinator-dissertation-and-request-for-help/<p>if you'd be willing to help, i would appreciate your help with two things.<p>one - please take a (very short) survey here:<p>http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dgf5mnbuqvdfrc1zdvlxblqyx01gehc6ma..<p>two - i'm hoping to use a better name than "startup incubator."  does anyone have any ideas? 2009-08-10 08:15:18 UTC

1479782 does ios 4 multitasking really use more battery life? i got the impression that unless you were using something like pandora that's actually churning cpu and io in the background, the new "multitasking" isn't really leaving multiple apps open.  it is simply freezing their state in memory so they would load quickly where you left them.  google is conflicted on the issue.  does anyone know for sure whether all those apps in the taskbar are alive and causing battery usage?  should i be vigilant about closing them (the interface is cumbersome) if i care about conserving power? 2010-07-02 00:56:52 UTC
9714323 ask hn: i/o of web server i read a couple of articles and papers and i came to the conclusion that event-driven pattern is the way to go if one in targeting unix platform. this is because unix(linux) kernel does not have asynchronous i&#x2f;o(this is not so with windows). i checked some open-source web server codes and  i noticed that some still use synchronous unix (select and epoll), bare bone. 
however, last few hours i stumbled on article written by a top dog at mailinator which argued that threads are still fast than event-driven(reactor). he argued that context switching and memory foot prints are just theoretical stuff. that what one should avoid is thread pool , and that threads should be started at the beginning. 
now my question is: which one is the best as per performance from your experience, and easy to code and maintain?  and i would like to go through more papers , articles, and blogs in order to fully understand the limitations of i&#x2f;o and the best way to handle such. 2015-06-14 09:37:03 UTC

4605014 ask hn: cheapest way to store 6tb online? what is the cheapest way to store 6tb of key-value data online?<p>the data is accessed via random lookups and needs to maintain &#60;0.5s service times per lookup and can expect around 200 concurrent accesses at any time.<p>it's currently hosted in a small cassandra cluster and that gives lookup times of 15ms-20ms, well within acceptable limits. however there's no reason it couldn't be moved to another indexing system (it could even be moved to a suitably tuned filesystem with little effort). 2012-10-02 23:45:46 UTC
2483851 ask hn: is there an open source license which prevents commercial use? i am planning on open sourcing a project i worked on. i am trying to find a license which gives others the freedom to use the code in whatever way they want to, with the caveat that they can't make money off it. i don't think anyone will try but still i just don't want others to be able to make money off my work. so do you know of a license which does what i am looking for? 2011-04-26 03:19:49 UTC
5773931 ask hn: so, i need regular expressions... i understand that now i have two problems. actually, since i'm trying to use these regex through applescript, it appears that i have three.<p>i've tried using smile from satimage, but i can't seem to establish an environment in which i can run a regex on the text i have (which is in quarkxpress). i can text that my expressions work, but i can't make manage to have them applied to the text in quark, much less change the text.<p>structurally, i feel i understand what i need to happen: activate quark, select the document, find the offending text (given the regex parameters), replace the text (if it meets certain conditions), else ignore the text.<p>my goal is to script the editorial style guide of the magazine i work for, thus side-stepping a lot of formatting/spell checking that we do, so i can focus on fact checking.<p>i have a script that already does the formatting, actually, but i wanted to write it in regex so that it might run faster and fulfill a more goals. for example, we switch all manner of words with the letter 'z' to a spelling with the letter 's', as is customary in british grammar: "analyze" to "analyse", "capitalization" to "capitalisation", you get the idea. i've had trouble with my script thus far, because it introduces certain errors (ie. "size" to "sise"). i thought regex could prevent this, and that if i could learn it, i could go on to solving other, more complex, problems. but at this stage, i can't even get a script with regex in it to launch and work on the text.<p>ideas? 2013-05-27 08:45:34 UTC

103838 as long as we're posting our chess-variants, here's mine i invented this when i was in high school to play with friends during study hall.  it was fun.<p>1. the chess board is the real projective plane: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/real_projective_plane .  so if a bishop is on h1 and moves forward and to the right, it comes out on a7 and would proceed to b6.  a rook that moves down from f1 comes out on c8 and proceeds to c7.<p>2. the board starts out empty.  players begin with each of the eight non-pawn pieces in their "inventory".  a turn consists either of moving a piece or of placing a piece from your inventory.  you must place your king on the first turn.<p>3. all pieces except for pawns follow the same movement rules as in regular chess.  pawns can move one space in any orthogonal direction or capture one space in any diagonal direction.<p>4. whenever one of your pieces other than a pawn is captured, you get a pawn placed in your inventory.<p>5. if one of your pawns captures a piece, your pawn transforms into the piece it captured (but remains its own color).<p>6. the object of the game is to capture your opponent's king. 2008-01-24 23:33:05 UTC

2524914 a simple way to prevent credit card fraud? ok, i'm not a cryptographer, so i might be missing something here big time.<p>but the whole psn-disaster (i'm a customer) made me think: there is good reason to store credit card information, like the psn did. because, frankly, i'd be annoyed to enter a 16 digit number each time i buy some 10 buck game.<p>but <i>why</i> can't sony (and anybody else who works with credit-cards) just encrypt them with a public key they agreed on with the cc-company, and only they can decrypt it? so if there was a security breach, we just revoke the key, and are done with it? is that too simple? 2011-05-08 00:05:30 UTC

2659789 ask hn: feedback on an open source business model despite the fact i feel quite strongly about using, contributing and writing open source software i've decided to start writing paid for software to be put on the various app store/marketplaces. most business models i've seen around writing or contributing to open source software tend to be entirely service and support orientated - something i'm not interested in doing. instead, the model i want to try is releasing software initially paid for proprietary, and then after a set amount of time (say 6-18 months, or when sales go below a threshold) release the code in its entirety under an open source license.<p>however, i'm unsure of this model for a few reasons. if potential customers are aware of this "approaching open sourcing", will there be a significant portion who'll just wait? if they are not aware of this event, would they feel ripped off or less hesitant to purchase any other software i write in the future? are there ways of hopefully mitigating both these potential issues - and is there anyone here who has done something like this successfully? 2011-06-16 01:39:19 UTC

the google discussion group, https:&#x2f;&#x2f;groups.google.com&#x2f;forum&#x2f;#!forum&#x2f;light-table-discussion
join the irc at #lighttable on irc.freenode.net<p>if you&#x27;re a passionate light-table user, please spend some time on improving the documentation!
if you wrote a plugin, please write a blog post or make a screencast on how you did it, or live-stream the making-of!
if you really like a feature, write an article, write a blog post, anything!
please write some blog posts, please write articles. this editor has so many hidden features i can&#x27;t figure out because no-one is talking about them.
if you don&#x27;t have the time to write blog posts, or if you&#x27;re at work and you&#x27;re not allowed to stream, or anything else, even a simple tweet will spread the love &lt;3<p>light-table would be a revolutionary ide if only it had a community. chris (the author of light-table) has the right idea of what light-table should be, because it&#x27;s based on a talk that changed the way chris, i and many others think about programming<i>. chris however, made a crucial mistake from the very beginning of the project, he never invested in a community.<p></i> the talk is available here, http:&#x2f;&#x2f;vimeo.com&#x2f;36579366 2014-10-04 23:11:54 UTC

2990449 ask hn: am i getting screwed on options/equity? (employee #2) hi hn. i need your help here. indulge me for a minute.<p>i am joining a [yc] startup as employee #2, and am being offered a near-market salary. so what's the problem? well, the options package amounts to about 0.4% of the company (pre-series a and thus, probably pre-mass dilution).<p>obviously the near-market salary is great and all, and some of you will probably say that i should take that and be happy... but i feel like i am taking on some risk by moving from "stable" work to a startup that may or may not survive the next 2 years. obviously the equity question is not a question at all if it doesn't survive, but i would like to think that such an early [engineering] hire who will be working probably-ridiculous hours deserves more than 0.4%.<p>am i just greedy? i think i generally have a good work ethic, and i will work hard in any case, but i am not very incentivized to work the usual 'crazy startup hours' if i get an almost ridiculously-small sized portion of "the pie." i guess i should add that this company does not have a very high valuation or anything, between 5-10 mil.<p>i've read most of the options/equity articles online, but feel free to post them again. should i ask for more? if so, how can i ask without seeming like a total jerk? am i just a greedy bastard? i'll accept any answers for all of these questions. thank you for reading. 2011-09-13 08:03:14 UTC

2. phone interview with hr
3. phone interview with some sort of department lead
4. technical phone interview
5. code challenge
6. in person interview + write code on a whiteboard.<p>i have failed interviews at every step listed above.
mostly i&#x27;m failing miserably on 4 - 6.<p>i have over a decade of professional experience, but not a cs degree. i know multiple programming languages, but during most interviews i blank out on the questions asked. i panic and my brain refuses to work with.<p>the same thing happens when i&#x27;m asked to write code in front of the interviewer - i panic and lock up.<p>i&#x27;ve started to lose confidence in myself even though i know i&#x27;m good at what i do. often times i feel that i&#x27;m being judged a bit harsher because i don&#x27;t have a cs degree - though that could be me projecting my own insecurities.<p>what am i doing wrong? am i in the wrong industry? should i pursue a degree? does anyone else blank out due to stress, and if so how do you overcome it? what can i do to improve myself and land a job? 2015-01-16 22:30:59 UTC

10325745 ask hn: yahoo pipes replacement? hey gang!<p>as some of you may have noticed, yahoo! pipes recently went dark (rip).<p>a speed-reading service i developed and use daily, glance.wtf, was built on top of yahoo! pipes, and now i&#x27;m looking for a pipes-compatible replacement.<p>fortunately, i was able to extract the pipe-bodies before pipes died, and those are available here: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;glanceapps&#x2f;pipeids&#x2f;tree&#x2f;master&#x2f;pipes<p>there are two interesting solutions i can see: pipe2py (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;ggaughan&#x2f;pipe2py) + google app engine and pipes2js (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;neyric&#x2f;pipes2js) + aws swf&#x2f;lambda.<p>but really, i&#x27;d just like to get my service back up again with as little time and money being required as possible. i&#x27;m hoping that somebody else out there has already come up with a hosted pipes replacement that i can simply piggy-back on.<p>does anybody know of anything like that, or have any suggestions about how to best solve this platform migration problem?<p>thanks!,

5458317 help me help humanity ok - i'm going out on a limb here to say that i believe world peace is possible and reasonably attainable within our lifetimes. i don't think it's a function of the "right" political or economic system. the underlying factor in every system is human nature. no, i don't have a recipe for changing human nature, but i do believe that human nature is evolving. we, as a humanity, are changing. what's changing is that we are becoming more loving.<p>love is common to every human. we all have the capacity to love others. we all desire to feel loved. and, we all want to do what we love. i think making a living doing what you love is the key to a peaceful society. here's why…<p>when you love yourself, you have dignity. you value your time and energy. doing what you really care about is more important than just making money. there's nothing wrong with money. i love money. but if money is more important than your time, you're willing to do stuff that might be negative. and that's the key difference. when you're motivated by "love”, there are certain things you're just not willing to do. like lie, cheat, steal, hurt others or the planet. if every person felt this way, we'd live in a more peaceful world.<p>maybe that's over simplifying, but it's also very true.<p>i’m building heartbeat.com to help people be successful doing what they love. it's a broad goal that we're systematically simplifying to provide simple tools and resources to make starting a small business easier. think of it as a type of enterprise application platform for the enterprise of one. our vision is to enable any one-person business, whether they're a merchant in ohio or a villager in africa, to run their entire operation from their mobile phone.<p>right now, the team is two of us. i've got design skills, can code, and can raise money (we've raised a hefty seed round). my partner manages all things community.  we're looking for a tech lead who shares our "why". i’d love to hear from anyone who can help. 2013-03-28 23:29:23 UTC

165855 ask news.yc: proposed experiment to test "the pg bias" it has been frequently commented by people outside the news.yc community that news.yc is too pandering to pg. to test this, i propose the following experiment which requires pg's co-operation. i propose that pg also post comments / submissions etc under some other username and then compare the average upmods for posts under the "pg" username vs the random anonymous username.
this can be started at an unspecified time in the future and run for lets say 1 month. only pg will know what username he is using other than pg.<p>i also propose the same for nickb and other prominent users. it may turn out that people upmod stuff from more recognizable names when they might have left it at neutral if some other user had submitted the same content.<p>well actually it may already be the case that they are  posting under multiple names.<p>might be an interesting social experiment.<p>edit : or is it already underway? nickb is pg :p? 2008-04-17 01:24:04 UTC

1791588 ask hn: how to legally obtain sports data for commercial use? this is a long standing question of mine reignited by bignoggins post at http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1772224 where he described the success of http://www.fantasymonsterapp.com.<p>i've often thought of building sports related apps (esp. pertaining to fantasy sports) but i've always struggled with how to legally obtain the necessary data (scheduling, statistics, player images, team logos, etc.) such that i can pursue it as a commercial venture.  an obvious solution is to simply scrape the info but i'd assume you'd get shut down or blocked rather quickly.  yahoo offers a fantasy sports api but it's to be used for non-commercial purposes only.<p>can anyone shed light on where/how to obtain current and past sports data that is available for commercial use? (i'm most interested in nfl, nba, mlb, nhl data)<p>thanks! 2010-10-14 16:52:11 UTC

9611150 ask hn: i hate my new job, need some advice i&#x27;m a php developer with about 3-4 years experience , living and working in uk,
about 2 months ago i had to move to manchester, because of a personal situation, so i had to leave my job ( which i regret now ), i was the lead developer of a high exposure web application and i enjoyed what i was doing over there , architecture design, coding, testing, monitoring ..., i was really motivated, keep myself updated everyday, learning new things everyweek and use them in projects right away.
anyway when i moved to manchester i had many job offers ( hard to find developers in uk i guess ) but i accepted a digital agency offer ( without actually knowing what i have to do everyday ) , salary is about average ( £26k ) but i don&#x27;t like my job at all, creating pointless websites for clients, jumping from magento to wordpress to drupal and now, i&#x27;m not only developer, i have to do some designing ( which isn&#x27;t my thing ) and integrate them into cmses.
i&#x27;m doing the junior developer&#x27;s job now and its hurting me, i feel pain everyday i want to go to work, and i just want to kill time to finish the day and count the days waiting for weekend to come ...
i know i should have done more research before joining this company, its my own fault to put myself in misery, i feel bad for this guys , they have probably spent a few grand for recruitment agencies fees to hire me and if i want to leave them and it takes them another month or two to find a replacement for me.
i have good amount of job offers , but i don&#x27;t know what do to now, i hate my job and i feel bad to leave them, what would you do if you were in my place ? 2015-05-27 13:29:10 UTC

1995029 ask hn: is there any market for creative coders? i'm a sophomore in high school at the moment, and have been thinking about the future quite a bit. i decided to take up processing, because i find visual feedback is helpful in being motivated to learn programming. it can produce beautiful images and interactions with very little code, and it's a lot of fun to work with. in your experience, do you think there is any market for creative coders? what would art buyers think about art that is created with a computer? is it a gimmick, or an evolving medium with lots of potential? i would love to hear your thoughts, and thanks in advance. 2010-12-11 16:01:04 UTC

956286 ask hn: how do you consume hacker news? although i enjoy reading hacker news, i haven't found a satisfying interface for doing so.  i have major gripes with both the website interface and the rss feed.<p>why i dislike the website interface:<p>--front page stories are not in chronological order (i can't keep track of which stories i've already read)<p>--stories are limited to the latest 210 (if i don't visit frequently, i can't see which stories i've missed)<p>--links to comments are too small and not not in a consistent location horizontally (i almost always want to read the discussion before i click through to the external site)<p>--i would also like to be able to filter stores that are below a certain points threshold.<p>why i dislike using the rss feed:<p>--does not show the number of points or the number of comments (crucial for selecting what to read)<p>i'm not just trying to be a hater; i think these things significantly harm my experience here.<p>so, am i just ignorant of better ways to consume hn?  do these things not annoy you too? 2009-11-22 22:11:10 UTC

9733883 ask hn: what are the best tools for analyzing large bodies of text? i&#x27;m a researcher in the social sciences, working on a project that requires me to scrape a large amount of text and then use nlp to determine things like sentiment analysis, lsm compatibility, and other linguistic metrics for different subsections of that content.<p>the issue: after weeks of work, i&#x27;ve scraped all this information (a few gb&#x27;s worth) and begun to analyze it using a mixture of node, python and bash scripts. in order to generate all of the necessary permutations of this data (looking at groups a, b, and c together, a &amp; c, a &amp; b, etc), i&#x27;ve generated an unwieldy number of text files (the script generated &gt; 50 gb before filling up my pitiful mbp hard drive), which i understand is no longer sustainable.<p>the easiest way forward is loading this all into a database i can query to analyze different permutations of populations. i don&#x27;t have much experience with sql, but it seems to fit here.<p>so how do i put all these .txt files into a sql or nosql database? are there any tools i could use to visualize this data (intellij, my editor, keeps breaking). and where should i do all this work? i&#x27;m thinking now either an external hard drive, or on a vps i can just tunnel into.<p>thanks in advance for your advice hn! 2015-06-17 17:55:24 UTC

7994673 ask hn: 16-hour work week jobs? i have had an extremely good experience doing a 4 hour per day, 4 day per week job, in which i was mainly doing a greenfield project for a startup company.<p>hands down, it was best work experience i have ever had. i was asked to do little every week, so i always had an extreme desire to outperform expectations, which led to an extreme drive to work, great work &#x2f; life balance, and a very(!) productive throughput every single workday!<p>another curious side-effect was to (on several occasions) actually work beyond the required ~16 hours per week, out of sheer pleasure.<p>i still remember that the same day i started working full time for that same company, my energy&#x2f;happiness&#x2f;productivity levels plunged, to only be lowered along the years.<p>i sincerely think it is quite unrealistic to ask a knowledge worker consistently deliver at full throttle for 40 hours every week (never mind the enslaving 60+ hours on many companies)<p>so my questions are the following:<p>- are these 4&#x2f;4 jobs easy to find? in which areas &#x2f; programming language domains?<p>- only greenfield projects make sense for this kind of work schedule? 2014-07-06 15:15:25 UTC

8320491 chapter two of peter thiel's new book i asked peter if i could post some of his new book on hn.  here is chapter two, which i think will be interesting to people here.<p>party like it’s 1999<p>our contrarian question—what important truth do very few people agree with you on?—is difficult to answer directly. it may be easier to start with a preliminary: what does everybody agree on? “madness is rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule,” nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). if you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.<p>consider an elementary proposition: companies exist to make money, not to lose it. this should be obvious to any thinking person. but it wasn’t so obvious to many in the late1990s, when no loss was too big to be described as an investment in an even bigger, brighter future. the conventional wisdom of the “new economy” accepted page views as a more authoritative, forward‐looking financial metric than something as pedestrian as profit.<p>conventional beliefs only ever come to appear arbitrary and wrong in retrospect; whenever one collapses, we call the old belief a bubble. but the distortions caused by bubbles don’t disappear when they pop. the internet bubble of the ’90s was the biggest of the last eight decades, and the lessons learned afterward define and distort almost all thinking about technology today. the first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past.<p>a quick history of the ’90s<p>the 1990s have a good image. we tend to remember them as a prosperous, optimistic decade that happened to end with the internet boom and bust. but many of those years were not as cheerful as our nostalgia holds. we’ve long since forgotten the global
context for the 18 months of dot‐com mania at decade’s end.<p>continue here: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;pastebin.com&#x2f;nuxlfmw4 2014-09-15 18:27:10 UTC

1. currently, emails are stored in my database and server, so i have access. the central storage allow for ease of sharing content between users. in the future, emails would be stored in the users&#x27; devices, and pass along to one another.<p>2. right now, user friction include hashtagged emails must also be cc or send to x@sharemoto.io, for the central hub to receive a copy. in the future, with user permission, i can scan their inbox for collect all hashtagged emails without author user remembering to cc a copy to my server, much like tripit&#x27;s itinerary scan.<p>3. re-do ui designs. (new mockups www.garyyauchan.com&#x2f;sharepoint-for-emails#gallery-311-2)<p>4. fix various bugs<p>however should i make all these changes before launching and getting beta users? should i just ask more of my friends to test it first? or should i launch soon to collect usage and patterns - really confirming validity - while (or before) working on these above issues in parallel? would i receive lower app rating if these issues are not fix, and those having problem re-launch the new version? 2014-01-12 21:23:33 UTC

7478037 presentation on how agile was implemented and the banana problem i had come across a video presentation on hn a while back (2 or 3 months ago). it was about how agile&#x2f;scrum was implemented at a certain company (reddit or linkedin or some other company like that). as part of that presentation the presenter talked about 3 major things:
1. how stories got prioritized among the different product owners.
2. the banana problem - when to stop refactoring
3. the packing problem - how much to include in a release.<p>i am unable to find this presentation. done all sorts of searches for banana problem and refactoring, etc and havent managed to come up with anything. can someone help me? 2014-03-27 01:45:11 UTC

7411209 ask hn: any code travellers out there? i&#x27;ve hunkered down to create a product and have 6 or 8 months worth of work a head of me. since i am not attached to my current place (in vancouver, canada) to do this work i&#x27;m considering travelling while coding.  i have the following requirements:<p><pre><code>  - stay at a given place for 2 months min. (otherwise i can not be productive).
  - monthly budget of 3000 cdn per month.
  - must allow for pet dog.
  - must have decent internet connection.
</code></pre>
i&#x27;ve considered a few options so far:<p><pre><code>  1. ecuador
  2. costa rica
  3. buy a travel trailer and find monthly spots in canada or us, sell trailer at end of trip.
</code></pre>
number 3 seems like a challenge from an internet perspective, while the others seem like a challenge bringing the dog.<p>are there any code travellers on hn that have done similar and have advice to provide? 2014-03-16 20:50:23 UTC

7319089 sending emails via plane in the jungle i was chatting with one of my dad&#x27;s friends recently who was telling me about how they sometimes used to send emails back in the 1990&#x27;s when they were in papua new guinea working as missionaries. i thought it was worth sharing!<p>&quot;the phone lines were down for several weeks&#x2f;months so we needed to transfer the emails from port moresby [the capital city where the only internet pipeline is&#x2f;was]. that was back in the days of mo drives (magneto optical read-write drives). high tech! we had to setup an intermediary post office box which collected the messages from the us in port moresby airport. when the mo drive was connected it transfered messages from and to the mo drive. so that let us fly the messages back and forth from port moresby airport to ukarumpa [the village in the eastern highlands province where the missionaries were based]. one morning, at about 4:30, i got a call because the pilot who was to pickup the disk could not get the procedure to work. it ended up being that someone (not me) had changed the password. those were the days.&quot; 2014-02-28 15:13:02 UTC

3292695 proactive techniques to stop & squish #botnets abstract. botnets, consisting of thousands of interconnected, remote-controlled computers, pose a big threat against the internet. we have witnessed the involvement of such malicious infrastructures in politically motivated attacks more than once in recent years. classical countermeasures are mostly reactive and conducted as part of incident response actions. this is often not sufficient. we argue that proactive measures are necessary to mitigate the botnet threat and demonstrate techniques based on a formalized view of botnet infrastructures. however, while being technically feasible, such actions raise legal and ethical questions. 2011-11-29 22:56:16 UTC

3984681 we hope you'll enjoy google's approach to email. (gmail 2004) from gmail team gmail-noreply@google.com
9/1/04
to me<p>first off, welcome. and thanks for agreeing to help us test gmail. by now you probably know the key ways in which gmail differs from traditional webmail services. searching instead of filing. a free gigabyte of storage. messages displayed in context as conversations.<p>so what else is new?<p>gmail has many other special features that will become apparent as you use your account. to help you get started, we encourage you to visit our help center, there you can browse frequently asked questions, read our getting started guide, or contact the gmail user support team. you'll also find information in the help center on such topics as:<p>importing your contacts from yahoo! mail, outlook, and others to gmail
using address auto-complete
setting up filters for incoming mail
using advanced search options
you may also have noticed some text ads or related links to the right of this message. they're placed there in the same way that ads are placed alongside google search results and, through our adsense program, on content pages across the web. the matching of ads to content in your gmail messages is performed entirely by computers; never by people. because the ads and links are matched to information that is of interest to you, we hope you'll find them relevant and useful.<p>we're working hard during our limited test to improve gmail and make it the best webmail service around. thanks for taking the plunge with us. we hope you'll enjoy google's approach to email.<p>thanks,<p>the gmail team<p>p.s. you can sign in to your account any time by visiting http://gmail.google.com 2012-05-16 23:51:07 UTC

6671961 travel bingo for kids app rejected for intense simulated gambling if you&#x27;ve ever played travel bingo as a kid, you know it simply involves looking out the window and spotting objects along the road. after submitting my app travel bingo for kids, it was rejected because it apparently contains intense simulated gambling.<p>they required me to change the minimum age for the app before accepting it. i can see the point with regular bingo if awards like coins or jewels are given... but travel bingo, which is basically checking off boxes of what you see on the side of the road?<p>anyways, with my next update i&#x27;ll attempt to submit it at 4+ again and see what happens.<p>if you want to check out the app it is here:

3219798 ask hn: are there any ipad ip control solutions? i've been working a lot in china, and there are of course many ip concerns. document and paper control are crucial as ip valuations are often worth millions. i was thinking of developing a new solution, but was wondering if anything like this exists already. the ipad seems like a good medium for this, due to the remote wipe and location capabilities, as well as its ability to replace paper media.<p>are there any applications that allow administrators to control document access very strictly? something whereby all the documents could be on the ipad, but require specific passwords to access, thus allowing careful control of the documents. 2011-11-10 12:10:57 UTC

3490162 respecting others privacy i understand that facebook is a phenomenon that many people enjoy on a daily basis. i was one of those people until i decided to cut it off in order to get more done. shorty after i became very aware of my privacy and how facebook is violating it everyday. the ftc is involved, many tech industry big wigs have plainly stated how facebook treats their users as the product without their knowledge or consent. all of this doesn’t bother me as a non user until someone i know involves me in facebook.... 2012-01-20 17:07:58 UTC

1924468 how did you become a designer? everyone is looking for a great designer these days- but clearly there are fewer designers than there are opportunities.<p>my question for these designers, 'how did you become a designer?'<p>what advice can you give on:
-books you've read
-websites you follow
-tools you use
-did you got to school or learn on your own?
-how long did it take for you to adopt the title of web designer?<p>i am sure there are a lot of other questions, but i wanted to start this discussion. it seems like everyone needs a designer - but no one really knows more than - 'yea that looks great! you are a great designer!' 2010-11-20 13:38:21 UTC

7436359 ask hn: should i work in palantir technologies or rocket fuel inc? there are already a few &#x27;should i work at company x or y?&#x27; sort of questions, but i think my circumstance is a bit different and unique, and the answers to this question would be valuable, so i just list my options as a new question here.<p>so i recently got offers from both palantir technologies and rocket fuel inc. they are both quite promising companies, but are working on different directions.<p>rocket fuel inc. is an ad-targeting company, they have very large scale systems (which i have interest on), and ai problems. i imagine there are many work related to 1) scaling the system 2) building tools for analyzing data and automation 3) ai-related algorithms and developments.<p>palantir technologies on the other hand is working on something really unique that few are working on but have great value and potential. i would imagine it deals with many new technology challenges that is completely new and few have seen or heard before. the company is super famous, and hires super talented engineers.<p>i heard a theory that computers can empower human in 2 ways (automation and augmentation), i see rocket fuel is doing really good on automation, while palantir is working on augmentation. they both create great value, and are both very appealing to me, but i have a thought that the consumer web sector is bit outdated now.<p>so i am having headache on which company to choose. what i look for is:
1) a place where i can apply my cs skill on, an opportunity to join a team to create great value
2) work that helps me improve, and lead me to my next goal (possibly join smaller start-up, or build my own start-up)
3) network and make friends with great engineers, designs, product managers, etc. so that i could be more exposed to startup opportunities. 2014-03-20 16:01:24 UTC

http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/ab-testing-significance-calculator-spreadsheet-in-excel/<p>though in my case i started my campaign with many keywords (about 400 keywords), and i now have the following:<p>keyword group a (10 keywords - the "best"): 47 clicks, 16 conversions<p>keyword group b (390 keywords - the rest):  244 clicks, 18 conversions<p>if i apply these data into the a/b testing significance calculator, i obtain a 99% confidence that a is better than b.
but does it really work with a group of keywords, or is this calculation meant to be used only for strict "singular" test cases? 2013-03-08 12:16:09 UTC

8924131 ask hn: what do you think about intern js testing framework/stack? i am new to unit testing as well as functional testing. in functional testing, we needed - cross-browser testing with chrome&#x2f;firefox and ie, ajax tests, file upload test.<p>we started with selenium which seemed to have all features but the java and complicated setup turned off our php &amp; javascript team. so at that point i started exploring js-based testing solutions.<p>i came across many solutions. the number of solutions confused me more rather than helping me.<p>this comparison table&#x2f;page seemed helpful - http:&#x2f;&#x2f;theintern.io&#x2f;#compare<p>as part of my habit, i tried to search hn archives to find views about shortlisted solutions.<p>to my surprise, hn has 3 threads for intern js and none of them got a single comment:<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=5666938<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=7759227<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=8155898<p>surprisingly, other solutions had more discussions on hn. example: nightwatch.js - https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=7156162<p>so i just wish to know if intern js is good choice for somebody writing test cases for first time? and can bit get things done without getting into java or selenium (it&#x27;s fine if selenium is used internally). 2015-01-21 17:22:10 UTC

216887 ask yc: would you partner with a domainer for your startup? let's say i have an offer from a domainer to use a very, very good domain (worth &#62;1 million) to develop a site. the logic is, it's easier to sell a developed website than just a domain; we would share the profits. i already developed the technology; it would be almost plug and play.<p>the problem is, he controls the domain, so nothing would stop him from putting his own website full of ads or something once the traffic gets high, leaving me with nothing. it's an issue of trust mainly - i'm not really familiar with contracts and stuff like that.<p>the startup would require about 5000 usd per month of fixed costs, so it would require vc capital. do you think this kind of partnership would be seen as problematic for getting vc funding?<p>thanks for your help :) 2008-06-13 16:35:53 UTC

10283112 put your code in some directory outside the document root, such as /home/mycode i am going through the 2nd chapter of this django tutorial(creating a project) : https:&#x2f;&#x2f;docs.djangoproject.com&#x2f;en&#x2f;1.8&#x2f;intro&#x2f;tutorial01&#x2f;<p>i created a folder called &quot;weiqi&quot; in my home directory. (named after the game i am best at!)<p>then i typed the command $ cd weiqi in the &quot;terminal&quot;<p>caigengyangs-macbook-pro:~ caigengyang$ cd weiqi --- input<p>and got this output :<p>caigengyangs-macbook-pro:weiqi caigengyang$ --- output<p>then i ran the following command in the terminal : $ django-admin startproject mysite.<p>this created a mysite folder which appeared inside the original weiqi folder in my home directory.
when i clicked on the mysite folder, there is a manage.py file and another mysite folder inside the original mysite folder.<p>when i click on the mysite folder, there are 4 files in it : __init__.py , settings.py , urls.py and wsgi.py.<p>the next chapter of the tutorial says this :
&quot;where should this code live?<p>if your background is in plain old php (with no use of modern frameworks), you’re probably used to putting code under the web server’s document root (in a place such as &#x2f;var&#x2f;www). with django, you don’t do that. it’s not a good idea to put any of this python code within your web server’s document root, because it risks the possibility that people may be able to view your code over the web. that’s not good for security.<p>put your code in some directory outside of the document root, such as &#x2f;home&#x2f;mycode.&quot;<p>i am a little confused about the last paragraph : what exactly is a &quot;directory outside of the document root, such as &#x2f;home&#x2f;mycode.&quot; and how do you &quot;put your code in this directory&quot; ? 2015-09-26 14:01:16 UTC

4490999 startup "co-founder" equity i'm considering becoming an equity partner in an existing company. i've worked a year with this company, probably 5-10 hours a week. i really believe in the company and think it can be something cool. i've not taken any payment or salary yet.<p>this saas company is making about $5k per month revenue, $3500 profit... so presumably without much effort we'll be at a similar place next year without too much work, if at all. the original founder started the company, quit his job 2 years ago, put $20k into the company, and has been working 60 hours weeks since then. he has yet to take payment or salary for his efforts. he is 55% equity owner. there are two silent partners at 4% each.<p>i'm being offered 7.5% equity, out of the remaining 37%. i'm expected to work around 20 hours/week for this level of equity. i'm having a hard time evaluating this number. is it high, low, or what? just don't have anything to base it own. any advice? 2012-09-07 20:18:17 UTC

7746077 ask hn: what do you do, when you are not productive? i am freelancing from home so productivity is a big thing for me. today, i was thinking what&#x27;s the best way to deal with the days when you are simply not productive, easily distracted, etc.<p>in the past, i used to feel bad about unproductive days, i&#x27;d try to make it up by staying up till late and trying to get something done. the next day i would get up late, it would propagate, one more &#x27;make up&#x27; night. few months later i just felt like an exhausted zombie.<p>after taking a break for a month, i am trying to cope with it in a different way. if i am just feeling unproductive, i do something that charges me with positive emotions (e.g. video game) or take a few hours walk. and if the day wasn&#x27;t productive, i just go to sleep early, no more late nights.<p>i was wondering, how other people are dealing with that? 2014-05-14 20:14:44 UTC
9172327 ask hn: how to create an awesome landing page? i&#x27;ve see a lot of startups announced on hn.  many with really nice landing pages.  it seems like the landing page is critically important to a startup&#x27;s launch since it&#x27;s the first thing prospective users see.  it&#x27;s like a clickable elevator pitch.<p>my business partner and i are getting closer to launching our own startup.  i&#x27;m a software developer and my partner is an ee.  i feel like between the two of us we have a long list of diverse talents but graphic design and marketing are not on that list.<p>we have sufficient capital but not enough that we can afford to blow it on an expensive marketing firm.  we used 99-designs in the past and got a logo we are quite happy with but i&#x27;m hesitant about trusting a handful of random designers with a landing page as it is not only about graphic design but also marketing.  i&#x27;m also hesitant about trusting it to a marketing firm which may or may not understand tech startups.<p>so, hn, how should we go about creating a landing page that will help us knock it out of the park, with out breaking the bank? 2015-03-09 17:32:33 UTC
1563698 jsxgraph - the best way to visualize/plot data jsxgraph is a cross-browser library for interactive geometry, function plotting, charting, and data visualization in a web browser. it is implemented completely in javascript, does not rely on any other library, and uses svg and vml. jsxgraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: less than 100 kbyte if embedded in a web page. no plug-ins are required! special care has been taken to optimize the performance.<p>starting with version 0.80 jsxgraph supports multitouch devices like the apple ipad and devices running any browser with svg support. 2010-07-31 13:35:10 UTC
1515764 ask hn: thought experiment -- what is the true value of an asset? lets imagine a situation where we're watching a world from the outside, without being able to send information in to it.<p>now suppose that we on the outside know, beyond a doubt that the model world will be destroyed unless the model inhabitants build a certain expensive artifact -- too expensive for any individual to build. maybe we're to be the agents of the destruction, or maybe we can predict the future. whatever. the essential points are that we know "if not x then destruction", that building x will require collective allocation of resources, and that the model inhabitants are uncertain about this future.<p>also, the world will be destroyed soon. say within the lifetime of the majority of our model people, so that most of them can expect to see the end of the world. the world will be destroyed in a way that does not confirm widely held religious beliefs. in other words it should appear to them as a bad thing, not a good thing.<p>ok, questions: how should the model people value some person's plan to build x to avoid disaster? what is the true value of x? are there different reasonable answers, or only one? should we prefer metrics that are more likely to cause x to be built, or is that irrelevant? 2010-07-14 19:59:02 UTC

9067469 ask hn: version control for large amount of small projects? how do you handle version control for a large amount (100+) of small projects (&lt;100 loc) with only a single contributor? 
especially when some of the projects share libraries which are maintained in a separate svn project.<p>at the moment i am torn between creating a single &quot;blanket&quot; repository and just check in the individual files and creating a single repository for each of the projects. 2015-02-18 07:57:39 UTC
952042 my first duck too often, i catch myself thinking, just one more feature, or bug fix, or design change, before i tell anyone about a project. however, i became quite inspired by the post by patio11: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=448842<p>so, i've started making my duck (a location-based, social gaming platform). right now, this consists of a lot of little experiments and mini-projects. the first of which i call "the booking desk" (http://10balloons.com/bd/index.php?y).<p>this app allows you to view mugshots and try to match it to the crime (listed in one of the options on the right). right now, i'm at duck 1.0, but hopefully i can build off the momentum and make it to duck 1.2. for now, thanks patio! and i hope someone has fun playing with this. 2009-11-20 06:44:17 UTC

2294656 does .biz domain extension hurt your business? i have some product ideas and about to register a  business domain. the .com extension of the name i have in mind is already taken. however, .biz is available. i read some speculation about how it may hurt the business. the extension .com is what every internet user is most used to. there's some blog about how google puts .biz websites well below in their search results. is .biz really a bad idea as part as search engines and ease of finding the business goes? thanks. 2011-03-06 18:27:28 UTC

189339 ask yc: what do you do about spam? hi all. we're a small team (5 people) but are inundated by spam.  we've all got iphones or blackberrys and so have been looking for online solutions which will filter the spam out before the email hits our server.  we tried one company, but they're wanting to charge us over $2000/year for this as a service and i was wondering what you do about spam?  are there any low cost (but good) services that you would recommend similar to the above?<p>thanks! 2008-05-14 06:47:05 UTC
1865587 ask hn: we're developing an android game. should we start promoting it? i've teamed up with two developers and one artist and we are now developing an android game together. the skill-level in our group is very high so i assume the game will be of high quality, also.<p>through reading hn i've come to the realization that proper marketing is at least 50% of the effort if we want our game (or any other product for that matter) to be a success. so should we start now?<p>i thought about what we could do. we could start a blog where we write about the progress, but i am not sure if this would be that interesting for anyone. after all its just a couple of guys writing java-code and the graphics are currently just blocks in 3 different colors.<p>should we just relax and finish coding until we release the game and then worry about marketing? there's an interesting comment about that here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1527365<p>or is it time to act now? if yes, how?<p>also: does it make sense to start looking for a game-publisher?<p>thank you for any suggestions! 2010-11-03 17:27:14 UTC

5354702 ask hn: spare netflix developer account hi guys, i built flixeye: http://flixeye.com as a side-project for watchlist notifications of streaming movies.<p>until now i was using netflix' odata api for movie lookups, but with the recent api changes[1] odata will be retired, which would break my little app. to make it worse, netflix is no longer issuing new public api developer keys.<p>i was wondering if someone can share/transfer their inactive/unused netflix developer account with a valid api that they don't use. i can then use the api instead of odata for my app. i'll really appreciate your help.<p>please email me at info@flixeye.com<p>thanks!<p>[1] http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/changes_to_the_public_api_program 2013-03-11 03:10:50 UTC

2973627 yelp keeps deal business running, ceo says in exclusive interview austrian it-blog www.futurezone.at got an exclusive interview with yelp-ceo jeremy stoppelman, who said that yelp is not stopping it´s deals business, as other media reported recently. he´s not convinced of the push emails groupon is doing and said that he found a more elegant way to sell coupons to customers. stoppelman also tells new facts abut the “instant personalization”, which yelp and facebook partners on. he states that about 100 users are opting out of the “instant personalization” on a daily basis. read more about his opinions on the ongoing troubles with google, the new competitor foursquare and his investment in palantir technologies here (german language):<p>http://futurezone.at/digitallife/4845-yelp-deals-sind-definitiv-nicht-tot.php<p>for all you non-german speakers, here´s the link to the google translation of the interview:<p>53 million users, 20 million reviews: yelp is primarily in the united states to the fixed points of the social web. the evaluation portal expands in 2011, especially in europe, has its own community manager in vienna and employed in this country competes mainly with tupalo. with online coupons, the company founded in 2004, has discovered a new source of revenue besides online advertising. rob krolik, although one with an experienced financial manager has hired as cfo, prepare half the rumors of the ipo, trade media are currently not fully convinced of the idea of ​​couponing. the yelp hq in san francisco (just around the corner resides the short message service twitter) is presented yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman the issues of future zone.<p>in recent days, there were more reports that his deals yelp veers off-again deals. is that true?
no. a small strategic decision has since transformed into a huge story because the media now appear widely on the idea that someone is a bad business deal business. we had 30 people who sold these deals, and we have reduced to 15, which deals exclusively sell and no ads.<p>but this means that the sending of offers via email, as it makes groupon not work so well. facebook also has stopped.
it does work, there are hundreds of companies offering this. but it really does not fit on yelp. groupon has "groupon stores" tried to copy us, but that also did not work. groupon comes as an email to you, but the users come to yelp. and there they can still buy vouchers, which brings us to the business owners and traffic and revenue. this is a more elegant solution, deals are definitely not dead<p>it is yet another feature to which there was about at facebook four square and big hype, but does not want to really stand out: check-ins.
check-in at yelp bring an extra level of authenticity for the reviews, write the user about the premises. the introduction of functional activity has been even more users to follow. make check-in additional data in order to find some popular restaurants. but burton has believed that they build the next facebook, a social network for mobile phones, but that's not the case. i do not believe that check-ins are something that everyone will benefit once the time.<p>foursquare penetrating ever further into the social sector review. you see the new yorker as competitors?
you obviously want to turn into a local leader, but that is hard for them. because the core of the service is checking in, and those are not very interesting data. foursquare has not yet proven that they can influence people in decision making, and currently there is no one who has such deep data shops and restaurants such as yelp.<p>yelp has a different, much larger rival google. the search engine has recently local ratings from third parties, including yelp, removed from google places. yelp meets the tough?
to be clear: 2006 google yelp has licensed content to integrate them into what was then google local. we have allowed for some time, but then we have found that they are building a website that more and more like our looks. that is why we have opted out of the agreement and continued to grow organically. then they have continued our reviews indexed for google places and recently stopped.<p>so that was in your best interest?
yes and no. we are now out there, but in the google search, we are now ranked as sometimes below their own products. from a consumer perspective, one could say that this is not optimal, not to show the best content and google's own products against competitors to prefer. we do not like.<p>on the other hand, you are dependent on as a partner of google, since google maps is integrated with yelp. could you change partners, to about bing maps?
we have an agreement with google related to maps and prefer not to change, because we like maps. we will use it as long as long as google, it makes available.
yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman, yelp ceo jeremy stoppelman the company's headquarters in san francisco<p>change of subject: the most valuable user content, the yelp, are the reviews. however, you can buy positive reviews put five dollars on the web. how do you fight this?
sure it happens, that's just one of many way to get positive reviews and manipulate yelp. we fight against this problem since our inception. that is why we have developed a filter so that only trusted content is displayed on the website. bottom of a page users see a number that shows how many reviews are filtered.<p>how does the filter?
haha, that would like to know all the spammers, that's the secret ingredient of yelp. in principle, we have to solve the same problem as google: you evaluate all the links on the web, and some of them have been manipulated in order to bring certain websites higher in search results. for yelp is a little harder because we are dealing not with links but with texts.<p>what happens to a business that appear on the entry yelp many fake reviews?
we are not talking publicly about the internal operations of scoring, but there are definitely incentives for local, they do not cheat.<p>for more than a year, yelp is a partner of facebook in the "instant personalization" to the yelp page automatically personalized based on the personal details to logged in facebook users. what brings the yelp?
two points: first, to log on yelp has become very simple, so we get more users. on the other hand, we can you so that you have not logged in you, show reviews, which have posted your facebook friends. this is a bonus for the user.<p>i can imagine that not all users want this feature, since their unsolicited data between facebook and yelp are transmitted. how many users turn the "instant personalization" on yelp again?
not very many, only a very small percentage of turns from the back, not even 100 users per day.<p>the personalization of web content is increasingly being criticized about in the book "the filter bubble" by eli pariser. how far would go in the personalization of yelp?
i think the criticism comes as a bit too far. we live in a world of information overload, and when i get presents relevant data for me, i am a happier users. if groupon me a deal for zuschickt beinenthaarung, i will not buy the deal. if i live in a bubble filter, in which i'm not getting this deal, i do not care. i prefer living in a filtered world than in one where i am bombarded with irrelevant information. this also underpins the success of google.<p>you can also watch with yelp consumer trends?
i do not invest much time in such analysis, but what you could see in san francisco, is the cupcake explosion. also booming "frozen yogurt" shops and food stalls offering quality food. local organic food and vegan restaurants are also a growing issue.<p>yelp has recently launched its ipad app. they already work on a version for android tablets?
the more we wait, it still lacks an outstanding android-tablet that can capture the market. currently dominates the ipad or any other tablets.<p>they have also invested in the start-up palantir technologies, data mining technologies such as for the u.s. government to combat terrorism and cyber crime is available. are you afraid of a cyber war?
some other former paypal employees (stoppelman was co-founder of paypal, note) as peter thiel have invested in palantir first, i have come later. but i do not spend much time with this company, and i do not know much more than you have just said about it. they have also sold data analysis software to the world of finance and hedge funds. but i have not been investing for fear of a cyber-war. 2011-09-08 12:32:40 UTC

1645377 ask hn: how can i learn how to formally verify haskell programs? to give some context into my current state of knowledge, i'm currently enrolled in a calculus course. my experience with formal logic is somewhat limited, but i have played around with both propositional and predicate calculus.<p>as of late, i've been extremely obsessed with the idea of formal correctness. even though it's fairly unlikely that i'll be more employable with the skill, i'm still curious on how to learn formal verification, if only for the fact that it'll help me reason with existing programs better and the confidence of having a 100% correct algorithm is pretty cool :)<p>unfortunately, searches on the haskell wiki and on google give me links to research papers that i unfortunately don't have the prerequisites to understand. a wikipedia search explains that through the curry-howard isomorphism allows for programs to be translated into combinatory logic and then be reasoned with, but i'm not sure whether simple combinatory logic is enough to handle a language like haskell.<p>so, if i'm going to approach the beast, what would be the best way to do so? what kind of knowledge should i know about logic and haskell, and what kind of books or articles would best explain the required concepts? 2010-08-30 04:18:48 UTC

5289976 which javascript templating framework for mobile first designs? i'm investigating the various js templating frameworks to use for a mobile first rwd.<p>the reason i want to use this is because this is within a corporate environment. it makes sense to use something that requires very little setup and is already supported by modern browsers. i also don't have access to database or json strings so everything must be stored locally and versioned through something like git.<p>i'd love to go full-blown with a mvc framework but at this point it's overkill and i'm still a complete newb. this will serve as a prototype, mostly a proof of concept when it's finished. my main needs would be for templating common elements, like header, footer, content areas, etc.<p>if i can do something fast enough, i might be able to use this as a way to convince the overlords of the company to ditch trying to go with a cms like cq5, teamsite, or another java based system. 2013-02-27 01:46:28 UTC

7126390 ask hn: how long is too long? i&#x27;ve been in my current dev job for about 4 years, moving a c++ fat client to .net&#x2f;web (mainly .net dev and team lead prior to that).  i&#x27;m probably the one with the most experience&#x2f;knowledge of the &quot;newer technologies&quot; in the office, but compared to your average hacker in a startup, i&#x27;m just a beginner.<p>most of what i&#x27;m learning is what i&#x27;m teaching myself, although i&#x27;m learning the odd bit about c++ from colleagues (easily my weakest area).<p>i live in berlin, so the startup scene is pretty good, and the prospect of working with a bunch of &quot;like minded&quot; talented people really excites me. on the other hand, i&#x27;m gaining experience in web (specifically js, angular), and i&#x27;ve run training sessions for the company, which i find a really good way to get a deeper understanding of a language or technology.  being the &quot;go-to&quot; guy for questions &amp; architecture certainly has a feel-good factor, even if i still feel like a beginner.<p>this will be my 5th year, and i&#x27;m weighing up staying on, learning-by-doing (as opposed to from colleagues) as much as i can, or trying the startup scene.<p>5 years feels like a limit - i don&#x27;t want to stagnate, but i enjoy what i do.<p>how long do you consider to be too long?  i.e. if you read a cv (edit: resume), how long would give you a negative feeling about the candidate? 2014-01-26 19:16:35 UTC

6790871 ask hn: voip anyone? hi all,<p>&lt;tl;dr&gt;
you are operating multi-national and you are using a voip provider? which one? are you happy with it? what could be better?
&lt;&#x2f;tl;dr&gt;<p>lets assume a startup&#x2f;company slowly grows up and goes multinational. assume further the main office is in the us, you are targeting new customers in europe and australia and to overcome timezone problems you have a support team in the us, europe and australia.<p>i guess it would come down to some providers like vocalocity (vonage) [1], ringcentral [2] and the more or less diy providers callwithus [3]&#x2f;voip.ms [4]?<p>now, i saw providers like to high-price their services and features (ring-calls, call forwarding, ...), although it is basically <i>all</i> supported by sip anyway. is that correct?<p>...and here ends my knowledge totally:
the way the packet travels is always source-server-destination <i>only</i> if the server is acting as a proxy? meaning if someone calls from australia to australia, but the sip server is in canada and acts also as a proxy, then there will be probably a round trip of 500ms? or is this always the case? i was reading quite a while that voip.ms is having therefore a couple of servers [5]. i have played a little bit around with callwithus and get around 130ms delay to their echo-service and about 150ms delay to hongkong (i&#x27;m in europe). then i left a skype conversation running to the us and someone called my did number with his phone and, although i have no exact numbers, the latency was terrible compared to the running skype conversation.<p>i am pretty stuck. any help, advise, or any pointing in the right direction is highly appreciated! i can&#x27;t be alone with that :)<p>thanks<p>[1] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.vocalocity.com&#x2f;

1819285 ask hn: likely demand for a big monitor extension for a small laptop? an idea has been stirring in my grey mash for a while, got no way i can follow it up. but, i was wondering what you would think of it:<p>a large monitor(extension) for a small laptop.<p>this was a an issue i wrestled when i bought my last laptop. i loved the small laptops but hated their small monitor size. i like the low weight, but am addicted to screen space. not having enough monitor space just brings down my productivity and its just so tiring toggling between windows.<p>so, i thought, why can't be there be a light and thin portable monitor? something that has a monitor cable for getting the display info and a usb cable for the power supply. something that can be either just clipped over the original laptop monitor or be propped up to the side of the laptop, to enable the use of both monitors at the same time.<p>i don't think its impossible to make a 15" portable monitor that is not more than 5mm to 8 mm thick, with a stiff enough case to safely carry it around.<p>but, the big question - would there be a market for such a product?<p>any thoughts? 2010-10-22 11:38:34 UTC

1. show the big picture

744470 ask hn: my first open src. how do i choose a license? hey hn,<p>i've just written a simple as3 value object generator that allows you to transfer typed objects with amfphp. this was already available in flex (see: weborb, among others), but i was unable to find a decent solution for pure as3.<p>so over a few days i wrote a few scripts that take a db and generate value objects from its tables, as well as service layers to do simple crud like save, query, querycollection etc.<p>i started the project hosting on google but realized i hadn't thought about a license type. any suggestions? 2009-08-05 23:25:49 UTC

7016111 ask hn: should we degrade our product to get a first, major customer? hello everyone,<p>i&#x27;m here to share my frustration :)<p>few weeks ago we met a ceo of a major company that had interest in our product.<p>he was really excited to work with us - up till the moment he heard we haven&#x27;t developed an ios version of our product yet.<p>the meeting ended when he said to us something like: &quot;i&#x27;ll be glad to work with you, but only when you have both android and ios versions.&quot;<p>so, after a short discussion we made a small pivot and started developing the product almost from scratch - with phonegap. (not such a big deal since most of the logic reside on the server anyway).<p>now although the app is relatively basic in terms of graphics, it feels a little sluggish and slow to respond.<p>so we were left with a dilemma - would you make a compromise about the quality of the product just to get a first major customer you would love to have on your porfolio? 2014-01-07 07:13:31 UTC
2031875 ask hn: should usernames have a minimum length? some sites don't allow users to select usernames less than 5 or 6 characters in length.  is there a good reason for this? 2010-12-22 17:46:05 UTC
8529394 ask hn: product/tool suggestion request a small medical practice has for years (going back to 1988)used written records for their patients. they have a book where they assign a number, add the name and postal address of patient. they then use a card with the assigned number to write the medical stuff (age, symptoms, prognosis, etc). as well, they give the patient a matching (smaller) card for follow up visits.
patients often misplace their reference cards, and end up being given new files that make no reference to previous files.
to solve this, they had the book records (manually assigned, unique -but with clerical error repetitions and omissions- file numbers; name and p. o. box addresses) typed into excel, hoping to be able to search in the excel file for multiple repeats by the same patient as well as for when a patient returns without their patient card. there&#x27;s about 60,000 records in total.
the problem is that excel is not very useful when a search for john someone yields 22 john someones from a batch of 60k records. i want to give them a tool that, when they search for john someone, it brings up all the 22 john someones, but sorts them,say, in order of date (most recent first), and if the addresses are the same, it can flag records that represent the same patient. that sort of thing.
can you recommend a tool for this? i&#x27;ve no idea how elastic search works, but reading about it makes me think using it for this would be akin to using a space-ship where a hand-glider (maybe?) might be enough. 2014-10-29 19:39:22 UTC
4237403 ask hn: how would you reach to your first 1000 users if you were quora/reddit how does website like quora or reddit would get their first 1000 or 10k users. quora at least have features, where friends invite other friends, so it may have ripple effect. however reddit even doesn't have that. so how and where will these guys advertise.<p>i have been told that a good way reach users is to first identify them, see what websites they visit and then reach out to them though those websites. however its unclear to me that how would you reach user through other websites. would you write link to you websites in comments of other website? wouldn't that generate negative pr. e.g. quora knows that their users go to ask.com or yahoo/google answers, how would quora attract user from them to their website.<p>i also have some startup idea where user users generate some content and other discuss it. however its extremely unclear to me that how i would reach my first few users. 2012-07-12 23:26:31 UTC
6190284 let us help ubuntu edge, its only 12 days left   hi,i think most of us would like to see ubuntu edge campaign to get funded successfully. you might have already backed the project, referred friends and promoted the campaign, which is great and got superb initial response.<p>as of now campaign grabbed $9,320,098 out of 32 million. at this point i think only major industry backing can only make this campaign success within next 12 days.<p>device specs and softwares are just awesome for the tech community and probably we know this is the future, but <i>problem</i> is there not much of use case suggested for ubuntu edge in a enterprise environment.what we can do is imagine the possibilities of ubuntu edge in any enterprise solutions and come up with creative and innovative ideas,share them with others through social media, if possible try to convince any enterprise customer to back ubuntu campaign. i am sure there should be lot of ideas in your mind, please share them and let us make this phone a reality. 2013-08-10 06:47:30 UTC

everyday i discover a new interesting book/course on the web/hn and i am tempted to take it but that means i gave less attention to the courses/books i am already taking.<p>i think in the last few months, i have taken lot of courses (udacity, edx, coursera etc) but seldom i have gone past the 2nd or 3rd week lectures/assignments. its same with books as well, i can't follow the book till the end.<p>i am sure i can't be the only person facing these issues, can you folks advice me on what to do? how do i tackle these issues?<p>also, have you ever faced such problems? if so i would like to hear about your issues and how you overcame them.<p>thanks 2013-05-09 16:42:09 UTC

3078956 why has steve jobs' death got more press than ralph steinman's? right now, every single story in the top 30 on hn is related to steve jobs. a search for "ralph steinman" on hn now turns up a total of two results (but these proportions are not limited to hn). i would like to find an answer and explanation to the question in the title. was jobs that much more valuable to society? whether technology is beneficial to society is out of the question-- did <i>jobs</i> technological innovations contribute more to society than a nobel laureate's work in immunology, or does it just come down to popularity with the general public? 2011-10-06 03:56:05 UTC

1251510 ask hn: examples of (but no "get-rich") paid membership sites? hey, i'm considering making a paid membership site with deeply researched info about a niche topic. not about how to make $ on the internets. do you guys know of good examples that i could have a look at, again, that are not trying to teach you how to make money on the internet but instead provide some niche info and charge membership fees. seo comes to mind, but let's leave that out too, it's also about making money on the internet :) 2010-04-09 00:29:29 UTC

8908833 show hn: ink: an llvm based programming language [wip] hi there. i&#x27;m working on a programming language -- called ink - in my spare time, with a friend. it uses llvm for the backend, the parser and lexer are both hand written in c. the project is just for a bit of fun, we aren&#x27;t trying to &quot;revolutionize the programming language&quot;, but we&#x27;re okay with being a bit quirky and out of the box with some of the syntax&#x2f;features in the language. at the moment, the language is in it&#x27;s early stages, and there&#x27;s still a lot to do, which means that if you want to learn more about compilers, now would be a good time to start working on the language, since it&#x27;s code base isn&#x27;t as large as say, rust. we&#x27;re trying to implement the core of the language, so it will be very similar to c, with a few quirks here and there. nothing is perfect at the moment, and there&#x27;s still loads of stuff we&#x27;ve either missed out, or are yet to do.<p>i&#x27;m posting this because (i feel that) it&#x27;s an interesting project we&#x27;re working on and we could do with some contributors, since the main developers are mostly students who either have jobs, school work and more (not that you don&#x27;t, but the more contributors the better, no?). if you post a lot of pr&#x27;s or we notice you&#x27;re an active contributor, you will probably be invited to join &quot;the official developer team&quot;, ooooooooh, exciting.<p>anyways, here&#x27;s a link to the repository: 
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;ink-lang&#x2f;ink<p>if you go to misc&#x2f;reference.md you can read about the road we&#x27;re planning with the language, things that we&#x27;re going to implement, etc. we don&#x27;t have a really detailed&#x2f;formal specification just yet. 2015-01-18 20:53:07 UTC

887697 ethics of subliminal messaging: carnegie mellon's gates center i'm curious to know, what are your views on the ethics of using subliminal messaging on students?<p>the reason i ask is that i'm currently a cs student at carnegie mellon university. as many of you may know, the gates center was built due to generous funding from bill gates. however, as i walked through the halls of the new building for the hundredth time, i realized something quite intriguing.<p>in certain areas of the building you can hear voices! no these are not ghosts. after some investigation, i found extremely small hidden speakers designed to project sound towards one location. however, they spoke so softly that the average person would not realize that there was even any noise.<p>however, at closer inspection, these speakers appear to say three phrases repeatedly (at least that i could make out): "microsoft server", "dell", "computer science."<p>seeing as how bill gates himself funded the building, and dell provided the computers inside the building, this hardly seems like a coincidence that subliminal marketing is occurring within the gates building itself.<p>now i pose the question: does anyone else find a problem with the fact that students at carnegie mellon are subconsciously being enticed to buy from sponsors of their university? 2009-10-18 00:40:52 UTC

5883362 show hn: rss-box, a simple web-based rss reader you can host yourself with node two weeks until google reader goes away.<p>i&#x27;ve been building a replacement for myself:
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;harold&#x2f;rss-box<p>idea:
 - really free &amp; locally hosted (trivially)
 - a node app runs locally to fetch feeds and serve up the web interface
 - no database at all, everything stored in files on the file system
 - this means that if you host the node app in your dropbox, every machine syncing that dropbox stays up to date automatically (read items, etc...)<p>i&#x27;ve just been hacking here and there in my spare time, but it&#x27;s become usable, (i&#x27;ve been using it for the last week, and am now ready for google reader to go away) but the codebase is quite fun to hack so i thought i&#x27;d invite yous to come play.<p>(my first post here, apologies if i&#x27;ve violated any mores of this community.)<p>take care,

5453439 spacex resume hi everyone,
i've made an online resume at http://www.spacexresume.appspot.com in an attempt to get a position at spacex. i'm posting it here looking for any comments or advice you guys might have and to use you as a resource to help my chances. it may also help in the off chance the right person sees it and likes it.<p>a couple comments: 1. i've intentionally broken some links to content i don't want posted in this version 
2. part of me is nervous about posting this to the wild. i've copied spacex's base webpage without explicit permission, but my intentions are good and believe it's an innocent use of their source code. if some of you disagree, i'll take it down. 
3. if anyone works/knows anyone that works at spacex, feel free to put in a good word for me =)
thanks everyone,

444702 two reasons why the most successful people are often very nice it's been about a year since i've been in business and because i'm building my company in japan, i've had to pay particularly close attention to the intricacies of building relationships. as i've had the opportunity to come into contact with many amazing people, one thing has struck me about the most successful among the people i have met.<p>the most successful and well-connected people i have met over the last year are, more often than not, the most humble and accessible people i've met. i think this is because of two reasons:<p>the first is that you never really know who someone is based on simple first impressions. and, perhaps more importantly, you never know who someone will become. so, aside from the natural human decency that should accompany all of our relationships,  it's just smart from a business perspective to treat everyone with respect and not write off those who don't necessarily make a strong impression in person. i've met quite a few people here personally responsible for earning  tens or hundreds of millions of dollars and it's not rare for these people to be decidedly non-flashy and almost a little awkward. it would, of course, be a mistake to misjudge these individuals merely on the basis of the first impression they make because they are truly heavy hitters.<p>the other reason is one that is probably more common and it's simply part of the natural humility that comes from building up a business out of nothing. many of the successful people i know come from modest, decidedly non-elite backgrounds and this gives them the right combination of empathy and ambition that enables them to succeed.<p>just wanted to share that here in the hopes that it will be useful to the other startup founders here. 2009-01-22 13:15:29 UTC

5755376 should i give up?   i'm 31 now, and i left my job a while back because the work did not excite me.<p>it was a nice job and paid well, but i had no love or passion for anything in that industry<p>i have lived a nice life.  probably too nice.  my expectations are too high probably.<p>i made myself into a millionaire (barely), had a lot of fun, did a lot of traveling, dated pretty women, lived completely like a bachelor my whole life, but i want a lot more.<p>i want to have 100's of millions of dollars.  i want to be an angel investor and political figure who helps propel this world into the place we deserve and our kids deserve.<p>i've been trying to start, but i don't know what to start on.  i am just spinning my wheels.  every time i sit down to code, i can't even start.  all i see is that it will probably take me 10 years to make anything legit.  by then, i'll be in my 40's.  it probably won't even work out, and the chances are so slim that i'll ever be as successful as i want to be.<p>i guess i should just go back to what i was doing before and accept that life is a bitch, and i have it better than most people.  but i just cannot see myself doing it.<p>part of me just wants to enjoy life right now until i run out of money, then just peacefully go.  i don't really have a desire to live a regular life, all of my daydreams and aspirations are grandiose.<p>i feel trapped and i feel stuck.  which sounds like a hell of a statement from a young 30 something who has plenty of runway to get something started.  i just really don't know where the hell to begin, and everywhere i do begin feels like such a long haul or impossibility, that i give up before even really doing anything. 2013-05-23 04:36:21 UTC

4345927 what is the absolute cheapest way to process credit cards online what is the cheapest way to process credit cards online? i've used paypal &#38; stripe. at the lowest level, stripe is a better deal (no redirect). paypal forces you to redirect the user to paypal, process the payment, then redirect back to your site. in 2012, this is just crazy - which is why stripe is doing so well. for the same fee, your users stay on your site (2.9% + 30¢)<p>however this clearly isn't the cheapest option.<p>in the top post on hn, another user mentioned: "get a merchant account through a bank and authorize.net ." however i am wondering if this is still the best option.<p>hn - what is the absolute cheapest way to process credit cards online? 2012-08-06 16:49:04 UTC

7677016 ask hn: will i regret choosing python over clojure? because i&#x27;ve delayed learning a high-level programming language for too long, i have not developed a strong bias toward any in particular. i will code a web app for my current project whose main function will be a search engine for a local index of profiles. from preliminary research, i&#x27;m convinced that lisp or python are great choices. i&#x27;ve begun learning and will become proficient in both (i&#x27;ve chosen clojure as the dialect of lisp). i&#x27;ve found a lot of very good resources to get me started with python, and therefore i&#x27;m leaning more towards python with django for my web app.<p>some smart hackers evangelize the power of lisp over other languages. the main advantage, as i understand from my novice perspective, is the ability to create and use macros. is there anything i should be aware of that may cause me to wish i hadn&#x27;t chosen python over clojure to code the prototype? in my ignorance, i may be asking that you infer too much before answering. if you need more explicit info for my specific situation, then please ask. thank you very much for your time. 2014-04-30 22:51:43 UTC

(i suspect the answer is 2, but i'm not sure).<p>i can think of few people (none, really) who would spend 100k on buying a profitable saas product. am i mistaken? 2011-05-05 15:16:42 UTC

1789803 i need someone to build my website. my budget is $200 and i need it asap.  how many times have you been asked this by friends, colleagues, and referrals. the person generally continues to say...<p>"i really don't need anything too advanced. just a simple ecommerce/wiki/forum/community website. with a blog. it shouldn't take you more than a few hours. i actually could even do it myself no problem, but its just not worth my time. you know, i used to be the #1 cobol programmer in the 70s."<p>at this point, i sarcastically interrupt "would you like me to program your website in cobol so you can maintain it?" they never get the satire...<p>"oh, and really important. i like this website (shows random crappy website) that my friend has. can you make it like this? you know, but different? we're ready to launch, all we need is the website, and we need it done asap. if you say its going to take 8 hours, i expect that you could get it done by tomorrow."<p>i usually respond to this with "sure thing, if you pay in full now, i'll have it ready tomorrow morning." i'm never serious, but no one ever pulls out their checkbook either. usually this ends the conversation, as if the website were so trivial, it doesn't warrant compensation.<p>my analysis:<p>this happens to me almost weekly. i never accept these jobs obviously, but i find the apparent, almost desperate, need fascinating. despite the plethora of "do-it-yourself" website builders (weebly, squarespace, clover, heck even wordpress.com) these "small business" minded people aren't having their needs met. in fact, they are generally so technology inept (despite their cobol tenure) that they wouldn't be able to navigate the "3 easy steps of building a website" on any hosted cms if their lives depending on it.<p>i think this is where the hosted cms market is failing. these companies are trying to make a cms so easy, it's like making a facebook fan page. the problem is, these small business people can't even make those! they usually hire a student to do that as well. what they really need is someone to hold their hand through the entire process. they demand the service of a $10k+ project budget with a top design firm, but have a $200 "i can do it myself if i wanted to" budget.<p>if someone could figure this out, they'd be siphoning up a billion dollar market easily. i don't think technology is the sole answer. i think it's a combination of extremely lean business processes with technology. get cheap labor to do the hand holding while using the 3rd party cms solutions. the small business wants to send an email describing what they want the homepage to say. they don't want to use a website builder to edit text. they don't want to do anything but talk to someone. the cheap labor can do the transition, and margins can be high.<p>i'd really love to hear your thoughts on this. i never leave a problem as big as this just complaining. i always race to come up with a solution, and this one is a toughy. 2010-10-14 04:18:46 UTC

9211643 ask hn: i just got my stackoverflow python gold badge - is it worth anything? ok, i know this probably amounts to a (not-so-)humblebrag, but i&#x27;ve been paying close attention to my stats on stackoverflow, i&#x27;m in the top 3% overall in terms of rep. and this weekend, i finally achieved the python gold badge (my area of focus). it was hard to get, took a long time, and i benefited from strong english skills and research skills as well as my python and programming skills.<p>i mentioned it to my boss this morning, also a technical type, he told me that and $3 would buy me a cup of coffee. (he&#x27;s a good guy and i like him.) i nodded amiably, and as non-defensively as i could, said, &quot;well, some select for it.&quot; but who really does? it may get my foot in the door in some situations, and it might be considered a feather in the cap for my organization, but it&#x27;s certainly not my key to the top tech job at a fortune 500. i have to earn that kind credibility in other ways.<p>but it&#x27;s something, right? it&#x27;s an achievement, and it signals that i have the ability to reach goals. that says i&#x27;m worth something, doesn&#x27;t it? and it probably has some economic value too, doesn&#x27;t it? how would i quantify that? that&#x27;s my main question.<p>i&#x27;m probably asking to be smacked down here, but that&#x27;s a risk i&#x27;m willing to take. i&#x27;ve seen a sort of anti-stackoverflow current before, but you can&#x27;t deny that it helps people, and (i&#x27;ll hedge with &quot;virtually&quot;) all of us technical types use it at least as a supplement to documentation and reading the source, and i&#x27;ll brashly assert that many of us use it as a first resort thanks to google. and if i&#x27;ve helped people, that makes me feel really good, so i do have a lot of respect for joel spolsky and jeff atwood, and i&#x27;ve wanted, for a while now, to make a meaningful contribution to a resource that has helped me so much. i&#x27;m now starting to feel like i really have. to me, the economic question is one way of measuring that contribution.<p>evidence: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;stackoverflow.com&#x2f;help&#x2f;badges&#x2f;51&#x2f;python?userid=541136<p>addendum, gaius said: &quot;i&#x27;m afraid your boss was right. it may even be a negative, as it paints you as someone with a lot of free time.&quot;<p>my response (from below): well it certainly could do that. if it does, i can always chalk it up to sour grapes. but i think i have a good answer to that, if i encounter it in question form.<p>i also go to a lot of tech meetups and give tech talks. i&#x27;m ten-years married with no kids. i can spend my time how i choose. only i have something to show for all of my evenings over people who only play games or read click-bait. i want children, eventually, but i&#x27;m not ready yet. i&#x27;d also like another graduate degree, and i&#x27;d like even more experiences in finance, as now i&#x27;ve only been a financial advisor and worked in risk data and architecture.<p>i had over 150 answers on tax and retirement planning on all-experts.com with strong ratings, and they&#x27;ve deleted that material because it&#x27;s out of date, and now i just have a line on my old resume (it&#x27;s not even in my current one). i like that much of my material will not be dated as quickly on stackoverflow. 2015-03-16 14:37:21 UTC

1731699 ask hn: are mobile phones on a plane taking off or landing really dangerous? are there any actual studies and detailed research with proof that having my mobile phone on during take off or landing provides and increased risk of the plane crashing (or other adverse reaction?)<p>i mean logically if planes did not have sufficient shielding for this would a terrorist not just bring about 1000 phones (say its for export for sale) as hand luggage and just leave them on? also some planes now now allow mobile phones to be used on board.<p>things that have been done for the sake of it or have continued because that was the way it has always been really annoy me. and i really hate having to switch off my phone and my rss reader getting dirty looks for fellow passengers. 2010-09-27 14:07:19 UTC

380377 ask hn: clients are gone, lots of debt, what would you do? last october i left a comfy job at a marketing startup that had become very profitable (inc 500, ny times articles, and all that jazz). i had stopped taking classes full time to work with this company, so i never completed my cs degree. after leaving my job, i started my own company to develop some consumer site ideas. my partner bailed early to go to law school, so there was a bit of a gray cloud overhead from the start.<p>in order to get money coming in i began running lead generation and online marketing for a few clients. over time, that grew to consume my entire working hours. it peaked at about $70k in revenue in july and has been steadily declining from there to a low of $15k in november, thanks to the economy and increased online ad competition.<p>on monday of this week, without warning, my last two clients pulled the plug due to economic conditions. the deals were profitable, but they had too many account defaults. one client has seen his annual bad debts total double in november. so, to free up cash flow, they cut me loose.<p>i poured my entire savings into the company and had up to $50k in credit card debt at one point. running online campaigns and lead generation, you pay for ads up front and invoice in arrears.<p>as the company made profits, i paid myself as little as possible to cover my bills. the rest was used to pay down debt. early on, i tried doing contract work on the side to pay my personal bills. this worked until i was stiffed on a large project. since the business was making money by this point, i focused on it full time.<p>as it stands, the company has about $13k in credit card debts. i have an additional $17k in personal credit card debt from living off of credit before the company was profitable.<p>the corporation is getting one last $6k check. there are no finished products to show for the last year, no remaining savings, an incomplete cs degree, and $30k in debt between the company and myself. the corporation also has contracts to keep its rack space until the end of january at a cost of $600/month.<p>i just sold my old (expensive) car and got a toyota. i am vacating my apartment and bumming with parents and friends.<p>the corporation has an internal advertising and lead management system that i am tempted to lease to customers. there was talk with some local austin marketing guys of launching that as a product a few months back, but it never worked out. there are currently four servers sitting idle that could be put to use. there are also three consumer sites in various stages of completion.<p>if you were in this situation, what would you do? dissolve the company, get a job, and move on? go back to school? launch the advertising product? launch the consumer products while bumming around to avoid rent? a combination of the above?<p>has anyone been in a similar situation? i am seriously stressed out and likely not thinking clearly, so i would love an outside perspective. 2008-11-29 21:35:32 UTC

6822634 sebastian thrun calls the mooc medium "not a good fit" for everyone. thoughts? this specific quote from sebastian thrun in a fast company article deeply concerned me:<p><pre><code>    &quot;these were students from difficult neighborhoods, without good access
    to computers, and with all kinds of challenges in their lives,&quot; he
    says. &quot;it&#x27;s a group for which this medium is not a good fit.&quot;
</code></pre>
i can&#x27;t be the only one who is disillusioned by this conclusion. i strongly believe that the internet medium as a whole has the capability of democratizing education, even if moocs are not the right answer. a lot of edtech companies are increasing the availability of education, but they&#x27;re not increasing the motivation surrounding it.<p>first of all, do you think it&#x27;s possible to do thing that thrun backed out of? and if so, who or what has the best chance of doing so? 2013-11-30 08:26:12 UTC

443765 lead generation - customer nurturing using company website hi,
engago technologies ltd. presents leadsexplorer.
www.leadsexplorer.com www.engago.com<p>best regards,
tom
engago technologies ltd.<p>company websites are failing to generate b2b leads
about 2 years ago we from engago technologies had the plan to develop an online web service for businesses. during the writing of the business plan we were faced with the problem of lead generation as this would rely heavily upon the website.
industry research reports that only 2 to 3% of all website visitors will ever register on an online form for a download, a podcast or contact a company directly for further information.  thus about 97% of all potential customers are lost upfront.<p>on the other hand most (7 out of 10) business deals start with an internet search for retrieving information and comparing products and solutions.
this means most potential customers will be looking around your website, but hardly any of them will contact you or will reveal their identity. this leaves you without any selling opportunity although the leads have visited your website.<p>during several discussions with friends and colleagues active in different business, they recognized having the same problem. this led to the conclusion of being a general problem for both brick-and-mortar enterprises and online businesses.
any company that has visitors on their website hardly generates any leads from their website as there is no identification of those visitors and the companies they represent.<p>after a market research on several existing solutions we saw room for improvement in features, functions and a higher level of company identification. thus we decided to tackle the problem of lead generation and customer nurturing by developing a solution that starts by identifying the website visitors by company name and provides additional information like language, geographic location, number of visits and visitors by company, the search terms used or direct access. the thumbnails of the pages visited indicate visually the interest in your specific products or solutions.<p>using the friends and colleagues as beta users, allowed us to adjust and improve the solution to their needs by adding functions and features like a weekly or daily email report of the visiting companies.<p>lead generation
the first purpose of the service is to contact (by cold calling or sending email) possible contacts within the visiting organization. these contacts are found using the internet data mining on the company supplied by leadsexplorer.<p>in order to keep track of you communications we have added a crm that is seamless integrated with the website and email communication exchanges. thus any visitor from any company in the crm is plotted on the activity chart of the company. the activity charts bring together the communications history and the visit history. this allows you to see and analyze the interactions and the reactions upon your communications allowing adjusting the message.
the activity charts also indicate the prospects that need more or less attention compared to their lead qualification valuation.<p>as email has become probably the most important communications channel in business, we have added the automatic collection and aggregation of the emails you have sent to and received from a company. thus all of your emails are neatly organized for every customer in the crm.<p>customer retention
generating leads and turning them into new customers is very exciting, but keeping your customers will normally bring more operating income, hence the importance of improving the efficiency of your customer retention.<p>1) as you can precisely follow–up on your communications and the reactions of your customers by the visits and their communications, it is likely you can improve your customer retention as you can measure the level of interest of your customers. 
you will be able to analyze: 
- if a message generated interest or not.
- if there is any sign of interest
- if there is an increase or decrease of interest
- how the customer reacts upon different messages and information.<p>2) if the company starts visiting again or even worse stops visiting, it is time for your account manager to call upon his contacts within the company. he is then armed with the information about the interests shown in your products or your solutions by the pages visited or re-visited.<p>leadsexplorer http://www.leadsexplorer.com
the leadsexplorer web service is applicable to large and small companies having a website that receives traffic, no matter how much traffic.<p>our view is that all online information:
- the website
- the email communications
- the crm
has to come together in one environment in order to increase your sales and your bottom line.<p>leadsexplorer is available in 2 packages:
- the basic version for discovery of the visiting companies allowing capturing information from the internet and export the data to a csv file (comma separated values) for further use in a spreadsheet, data base or a crm.
pricing is based upon number of monthly visitors and number of users.<p>- the combined solution with discovery of the visiting companies and a crm provides the seamless integration between your company website and your email conversations with your leads and customers.
pricing is based upon the number of monthly leads and number of users.<p>engago technologies ltd. http://www.engago.com
engago technologies ltd. is a bootstrapped company from the uk that develops markets and operates online services for businesses.
the aim is to provide for businesses on demand web services, which they require to take full advantage of the new technologies of the digital age. 2009-01-21 20:42:11 UTC

4718067 ask hn: reject job offer after h1b issued? tl;dr is it a really bad idea to reject a job offer after having accepted it and received an h1b for it?<p>i'm not from the us. last year i received a job offer at one of the big companies in the valley but i couldn't take the offer immediately due to h1b caps, and we mutually agreed that i would move there and start working in december of this year.<p>i've been working on a few personal projects during this year in my home country while waiting to go to the us and one of them i've now realized has a lot of potential. so much, that i'm regretting having accepted this job offer and the fact that my visa has already been issued, because i'd like to dedicate 100% to getting this project off the ground. so,<p>1. does this sort of thing happen often? is this a normal and acceptable reason for rejecting a job offer that has already been accepted, even though of course this company won't necessarily like it? i don't want to permanently blow my chances of working with this company again, maybe in 5 or 10 years, if it comes to that.<p>2. would there be any grave legal consequences for me if i do this? including being unable to enter the us, not even for a tourism or business trip? 2012-10-30 16:30:08 UTC

4416526 attacks against xml digital signatures & encryption xml digital signatures are indirected signatures. to construct a signature, the content to be signed is canonicalized, digested, and metadata about the content (its location, the digest and canonicalization method) is saved as xml. this xml metadata is then itself canonicalized, digested, and the digest of the metadata is signed to produce the final signature. key information may optionally be packaged with the signature.the order of operations for signature validation, while unimportant from a cryptographic standpoint, can have a significant impact on whether many of the attacks detailed here are available to anonymous adversaries, or if the attack surface can be authenticated.the first operation of signature validation should be key resolution. optimally, any keyinfo attached to the signature can be discarded, and the proper key inferred from context and provided directly by the caller. if the keyinfo must be resolved from the signature, this resolution must be a distinct step so a trust decision in the key can be made before proceeding 2012-08-22 08:35:35 UTC

5113956 is facebook (privacy) respectable these days? lately a lot of people have been asking me to connect on facebook. i used to have an account years ago which i deleted (through the two-week long process) due to privacy concerns at the time. however, it's been a few years now and i think facebook has seen enough bad pr to <i>maybe</i> get the clue that folks care about their privacy, and i'm hoping that maybe it's a more respectable company now.<p>i've basically had my head in the sand for the last few years, ignoring all things fb. but i'd like to reconnect with old friends and more easily plan outings with new ones and i find sending group text messages clumsy at best :)<p>so can anyone offer comments on facebook, as it is <i>now</i> in january 2013, and user privacy? specifically, no matter how complex the privacy controls are (i'm a fairly smart guy, i can figure it out), my biggest concern is whether or not they're actually being ignored behind the scenes - based on my opinion of the company's past i wouldn't be surprised.<p>and if they actually <i>are</i> respecting individual privacy these days, do they have any features like google+ "circles" to share certain content with certain people? those pics of the girl making out with me at the party last night are great to share with my buddies, but maybe not my boss ;-)  (then again i do have a really cool manager at work...)<p>thanks everyone. 2013-01-25 04:27:50 UTC

9872496 should i turn my motivational/accountability texting service into a startup? hi everyone,<p>i&#x27;m a certified personal trainer and life coach. i personal train clients in-person and mentor people mostly over the phone in areas such as diet, fitness, and motivation.<p>just this year, i suggested my clients text me daily progress updates whenever they want and i&#x27;d respond accordingly. i&#x27;d say 80% of my clients text me their daily progress (like how well their diet is going or what they completed for a workout that day). it&#x27;s been a huge help keeping them motivated and accountable.<p>some of my clients have mentioned me to their friends, family, and co-workers and a handful of these new people have been interested in just my texting service - which i didn&#x27;t even think was a service to begin with. i just see&#x2f;saw it as a bonus for the clients i see regularly.<p>so my question is, should i make this into a website, service, or startup somehow? i&#x27;m not really sure where to begin if i were to do something technology wise. i just want to help whoever wants to be helped.<p>thank you!! and sorry for the long note! 2015-07-12 03:36:10 UTC

3704580 seeking review/feedback for my mvp - thrill engine hi everyone,<p>i am excited to share with you my venture  - thrill engine.
it's a service for finding and booking action sports travel destinations.<p>i started working on this out of few things:<p><pre><code>    pure passion - been riding a snowboard for a while, recently got into kiteboarding and surfing is next on the radar (life is short, gotta live it up :))!;
    after using similar services, while planning trips, seen areas of improvement;
    had a long time goal to start my own thing.

</code></pre>
i'm a hustler, who decided to learn and do all the coding by myself ( after struggling to find cto )
needless to say that it took me a lot of time and pain to build my mvp :)<p>please check it out and let me know your feedback -- http://www.thrillengine.com/

5745911 how useful is codecademy? i'm wondering if codecademy is that useful, because after all, they only teach you the principles of coding and not the actual coding you would use to build product with. i.e. they only learn you how to loop, but not how to do it in a sql/no-sql db, and therefor, a kickstart to a little project could stay off the runway while that is where you learn the most. i would like to have your opinions on this, please add to your comments if you use(d) the service or not. 2013-05-21 18:57:25 UTC

how are you doing recently?
i would like to introduce you a very good company and its website is
www.ele-stores.com. it can offer you all kinds of electronic products
that you may be in need,such as laptops ,gps ,tv lcd,cell
phones,ps3,mp3/4,motorcycles and etc........
you can take some time to have a check ,there must be something
interesting you 'd like to  purchase .
the contact email: elestores@188.com.  msn: ele-stores@hotmail.com<p>tel:  0086+13717782599<p>hope you can enjoy yourself in shopping from that company !<p>regards<p>they also decided it was a good idea to put that msg into my signature as well as set my account to vacation mode with the same vacation msg.<p>obviously this was a very brazen thing to do, and they clearly made no effort to cover it up, neither was my password changed. so i figure this is more likely an automated thing, i left my account logged in with a firefox 3 browser at work (university firewall) overnight, which is when this occured. so all signs point to some sort of an automated attack through the browser, does anybody know more about how this happened? 2008-12-18 23:14:18 UTC

5300408 ask hn: how do microsoft do continuous integration for windows os? was curious about how microsoft organize their continuous integration for windows os. i'm sure i remember reading a blog post about it somewhere, but i can't find it now.<p>specifically, can developers check out all of windows and reasonably expect to build it on their desktop machines? or is it simply too large. part of my thinks "you can do it with a linux kernel, why not?", and part of me thinks "windows has got to be a beast - it probably takes years to compile on a desktop machine"<p>given it's a pretty massive product, i'm interested in hearing from ex or current microsofters about how they organize it, particularly around change, so if you are on the file system team, and you submit a change, how agile/quickly can you get feedback as to whether it's worked on not? 2013-02-28 19:30:07 UTC

"if you ever feel too good about yourself, they have this thing called the internet and there you can find a lot of people who don’t like you..."
she proceeded to lovingly call out some real-life forum haters who could "suck it."<p>but seriously, how do you folks deal with the energy-suck that are negative non-participants/non-customers, who still want attention from you?<p>what about when it <i>is</i> a customer/participant, but they're just being a troll whose care and feeding can't scale? 2009-01-12 08:58:48 UTC

myself and a few of my friends have built a web based presentation editor/presenter (much like 280 slides; we built ours in cappuccino as well) with the hope of disrupting the presentation space. we're planning on launching our service within the next 1-2 months, but in the meantime we have decided to license our software (full source) to other companies in order to continue development.<p>we decided against putting up a public demo because we want to keep it under wraps for the general public until we launch. if you're interested in seeing a demo/connecting with us, drop us an email at throwaway3001@gmail.com! 2011-11-14 02:39:41 UTC

2267390 how google calculates search result count? is any body tell me how google calculates search result count?<p>in google search we always see "about 117,000,000 results (0.12 seconds)", but there is no straight way to go to "117,000,000"th result except next-&#62;next-&#62; on page.<p>another thing i observed is that, search results count are not real.<p>e.g. i have searched for search string "google videos", on first page i got "about 117, 000, 00o results"
but when i clicked for 10th page in the search i got "page 10 of about 468,000,000 results".
how this can be possible in 2 min??
is google making fool of us as we can not navigate to last result?
one more thing i had tried same search "google videos" 5 month back at that time result count was 438,000,000 see - http://twitpic.com/30o2cv/full

662037 ask hn: best rating system: reddit-style or amazon-style? i'm planning on working on a web app over summer. the core idea is for a site where people can post links to useful books (making money through the amazon associates scheme) or websites for learning skills, which are then ranked by quality and difficulty. eg, if you visit mywebsite.com/html, you'd probably see a link to w3schools.com at the top.<p>as my site isn't a news site, there's less of a need to 'bury' old links, which gives me a bit more flexibility in how content is rated. what do i use? a star-based voting system, such as amazon and many others use, or a vote up/down system, as used by hacker news, reddit, etc? though reddit-style is simpler, i think the amazon-style gives slightly more information.<p>there's also the possibility of a hybrid system (for example where down-votes = 0-star-votes, up-votes = 5-star-votes) though that isn't as intuitive and could confuse users.<p>opinions? which would you rather see?<p>site 1: 4.87 stars<p>site 2: 4.63 stars<p>site 3: 4.56 stars<p>more information, but gets hard to understand with many sites.<p>or:
site 1: 312 up-votes<p>site 2: 277 up-votes<p>site 2: 213 up-votes<p>simpler, but a bit vague. is 200 up-votes good or bad? 2009-06-17 16:25:16 UTC

5681763 ask hn: how to make a living from open source software on open source hardware? i've been working on a javascript interpreter for microcontrollers called espruino - it's taken an immense amount of work. ideally i'd make it open source so that people can install it, modify it, and port it to new platforms freely, but if hardware was sold with it preinstalled (so people are profiting from my work) they would have to pay a small royalty.<p>this seems reasonable to me - but looking at http://opensource.org/docs/osd it seems completely against the spirit of open source. i've contacted several well-known open hardware suppliers, and the response has been 'looks good - but i'm not using it unless it's open source, and if it's open source, why would i pay you any kind of royalty when competitors can use it for free?'<p>does anyone have suggestions about this? if i try and sell hardware with my software on, i'll be competing with others who can use my software for free! do i withold features? that hardly seems like it is in any of my users' best interests.<p>or do i just release espruino with some licence that allows people to access and modify the source - but only noncommercially. this won't be 'open source', but it seems to be in the best interests of my users.<p>any ideas would be hugely appreciated. 2013-05-09 17:34:27 UTC

5779164 ask hn: i need help with a career decision dear hn,<p>i am a mid level software engineer and i enjoy my job and working with the team. i've always tried to work hard and help the team in any way i can and never say no to anyone that ask me for help no matter how busy i am. as a result of this i have made great relationship with the team, some juniors would look up to me, and my supervisors would give me good ratings on my performance reviews, on both technical skills and team responsibilities, and they have commented that i'm already working at the senior level, and thank me for my efforts.<p>things start to change when i have a new supervisor, he dislikes my personality (he thinks i'm quiet, which previous supervisors and team members never had problems with), and thinks i am not committed to the team because of this and other actions of mine that he doesn't like (could be something as little as me not going to the office lunch). we have been through a few talks about this, despite whatever i said, he's not convinced. i feel like he's trying to change me into someone else, and the message i am getting is i won't get a promotion if i don't change, regardless of my abilities. he's actually a friendly person and he's good at what he does and i have respect for that. but it's not working for us because he has a vision of what a good team should behave like, and it was clear to me that he doesn't want a personality like mine in that perfect vision. we don't have the trust that i have with other team mates. and i'll never change any of my team mates. there is also a chance that he won't be my supervisor anymore in a few months time.<p>i have also received a job offer from another company. the offer is already above my current pay, but i'm not sure if it's a good enough offer for me to leave my current  team mates (my friends), and they are the reason that i go to work everyday. i'm not sure if i should give up all that and go to a strange company.<p>so what should i do? any advice will be appreciated.<p>thanks. 2013-05-28 10:24:58 UTC

9875239 bypass all corporate internet filtering at work, without admin rights disclaimer: doing this may be against your employer&#x27;s policies and may lead to discipline and&#x2f;or termination. pursue this at your own risk.<p>unfortunately, this requires having root on a server that is associated with a .com domain that is not blocked by your corporation&#x27;s proxy&#x2f;firewall.<p>1) set up your ssh server to listen on port 443.<p>2) install corkscrew. if you are on windows, cygwin&#x27;s install has a --no-admin option you can pass from the command line, which will allow you to install it to some local directory. once you have cygwin, you can install corkscrew with no problems.<p>3) set up ~&#x2f;.ssh&#x2f;config to route all outgoing non-local ssh connections over corkscrew to port 443 on your .com.<p>4) run an ssh tunnel via corkscrew through your server on port 443.<p>5) set up firefox to use a local socks5 proxy through your tunnel, making sure to check the dns prefetching checkbox.<p>6) browse away.<p>what is happening here is that the firewall&#x2f;proxy will not block outgoing http connections to port 443 on a non-blocked domain because they look like a normal web browsing request. since you are routing ssh over http (using corkscrew) and accessing the default https port (443), your ssh connection will look like a regular https request to a website. since your connection is encrypted, it is undistinguishable from normal web traffic, and it is highly unlikely that it will be blocked unless someone specifically looks into your traffic patterns and is sharp enough to recognize it (nobody has every caught me). none of port blocking, protocol filtering, or dns filtering will be able to block your internet access (unless you leak dns queries, which you will not if you use firefox.)<p>i believe that this is foolproof and have had 100% success with it so far. if anyone can see any flaws, please comment. otherwise, considering the plethora of partial solutions i found while establishing this method, i thought i might contribute my final workaround here. 2015-07-12 22:18:52 UTC

2355342 review our product rt2see (content promotion platform for twitter) what exactly is it?
http://rt2see.it is a content promotion platform for twitter. with rt2see you can share any url you want, but only let those who retweet your url view the content. with every rt2see campaign you maximize your content reach, while measuring effectiveness with real time stats.<p>how does it work?
1. enter a url you want to promote
2. rt2see will turn that url into a short url
3. tweet out a message with the short url
4. anyone that clicks on your short url will be asked to retweet your original message before being redirected to your content
5. track stats as your content is retweeted exponentially<p>some of the hurdles we see:
1. the public perception of injecting an ad model into twitter for retweets.
2. convincing retweeting without seeing the content first.<p>we'd love to hear some feedback on the model.<p>thank you.<p>http://rt2see.it 2011-03-22 17:24:28 UTC

1750468 ask hn: client-side md5 password hashing i'm currently writing the auth for our web application. normally the login form would have a username and password in a form. i hooked into the submit() event using javascript to change the value of the password to it's md5 equivalent.<p>now on the server, i treat the md5 hash as if it's a regular password - but this is assuming that the treatment is consistent between sign-up and log-in. the advantage here is that nobody except your client knows what your plaintext password is.<p>i'm sure that people would've tried doing this before. is there any disadvantage of doing this? i don't see any apart from the fact that disabling javascript will disable the login. any advice about this would be very useful. 2010-10-02 14:14:35 UTC
456825 ask hn: hacking mail server whats the best way to setup and configure a mail server for your application so that you may parse incoming messages and perform some functionality accordingly.<p>for instance i have an application in python/django for sending free sms to your friends in pakistan. i wanna add mail capabilities in it so that every registered user gets an email address like &#60;phone&#62;@isms.pk and any mail sent on it is processed and sent through my sms gateway. surely, i wouldn't want a "mailbox" for each user and periodically check all the mailboxes using imap/pop3. some hacking of mailserver to put some hooks would be a much better idea.<p>i'm on ubuntu linux and my preferred language is python. which mail server is the best choice in such scenarios? 2009-01-29 18:21:00 UTC
4630236 ask hn: what are the best open source projects to learn from? i see a lot of "how not to do x" and "you should never do y", as well as sites dedicated for bad practices and anti patterns.<p>- shithub http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4622805<p>- codecrap http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4622630<p>so i know now a lot of ways how <i>not</i> to code, but i much rather learn how to code, than how not to.<p>my question is, what are some widely agreed projects to take example from? (either written in java, ruby, python, javascript, scala) based on the following aspects<p>- good use of the language
- great error handling and logging 
- architecture 
- testability 
- concurrency 
- performance
- mvc patterns 
- security
- api design 
- naming conventions<p>what are the masterpieces of code of our modern day, that every programmer should know about?
or if we stick to the what not to, which famous projects i should not look into as an example? 2012-10-09 06:13:26 UTC

5739713 ask hn: how do you keep your servers/sites safe from hackers? hi,<p>this week i expect to receive delivery of a server with which i'll be building a prototype of an openstack server whose purpose will be to rent vps instances to the public. i haven't yet figured out how, but somehow there will be a public facing customer portal providing management access to the rented server instances, and i'm interested in making the security which protects this management panel strong enough to be a selling point when i go live.<p>i'm a little concerned that by making it a selling point i may be inadvertantly inviting hackers to come attack my site, but its a chance i'm willing to take.<p>i haven't figured out how openstack handles its customer portal yet, but i imagine however it works, it would help to protect it by placing it behind my own customer login system of some sort. i don't know how to code, so i'd have to figure out how to write something to implement this sort of thing- maybe i could crowdsource its development, but even then i would need to know enough about how it would need to be designed so that it would be secure from hackers.<p>all i know about hacker-proofing is that there's an app that exists called fail2ban that locks out repeated ssh login attempts. i don't know if it could be adapted to work for a site somehow.<p>how would hn readers make hacker safety a selling point in this case?<p>many thanks in advance.<p>-c 2013-05-20 20:06:07 UTC

2b) it's rare that everyone at the table is carrying cash; cards exacerbate the problem.<p>why even force the customer to ask? and when they do ask, why in the world is the answer so often no? is this just tradition/habit? a problem with point-of-sale machines? lazy servers? 2010-05-07 21:08:57 UTC

2025706 ask hn: review my startup: metadatalabs.com and debsnews.com this is a two-parter.  metadatalabs finds web video, annotates it with useful metadata and delivers it via a free api.  on average, 17 videos a second representing over 40 hours of video a minute go through our firehose.  our goal is to build an api for video that is as simple and useful as twitter's api is for tweets.<p>details are here: http://api.metadatalabs.com<p>you'll find a couple of working sample apps, videoroulette and videodeck, which will give you a feel for what's available in the firehose.<p>debsnews is a video news service built on top of the firehose:<p>http://debsnews.com<p>the ui model has elements of both twitter and hacker news / reddit.  channels follow a link structure much like twitter.  every channel has two views: a real-time feed under "most recent" (like twitter) and under "most popular" a rank based on popularity decaying over time (like hacker news, reddit and others.)  you can rapidly skim the most popular news videos or spend more time and dig down into details.<p>we're so close to the problem and we've been at it so long that it's become hard to tell if what we have is actually useful or if we're deluded.  we're eager to hear what you think.  feel free to respond here on hn or contact me directly: david at metadatalabs dot com.<p>thanks! 2010-12-20 20:44:45 UTC

but now, i sadly found the service in that story closed because after ran out of adwords credits, almost no one will go that site.<p>my experience is, even i post a good stuff to forums or blogs, the visitors will only increase to very high on that day. after few days later, nothing left, especially for a tool type service.<p>any good suggestion for marketing a new startup service?<p>thanks. 2010-07-22 03:33:26 UTC

3138142 ask hn: my revenue model- how does it sound? hi, i'm working on a video game start-up in athens, georgia. i was asked about our revenue model, so i did a formal write-up and was wondering how it sounds. any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<p>here goes:<p>our game will be released in two versions: a free, lite version (where users can play endlessly, but upgrades necessary to advance above a certain level are locked) and the full version, which will cost one dollar. it is hard to predict sales, but we expect about 50,000 copies in 2012. the app store keeps 30% of each sale.<p>the other part of our revenue model is merchandise. one thing that sets our game apart from other restaurant simulations is the simple, expressive, and numerous characters (rather than the boring, generic characters of many other games in this genre). we are focusing on creating popular characters that will re-occur in multiple games and be featured on merchandise. these re-occurring characters will not only boost the familiarity and popularity of each game, but also add to people's desire for merchandise.<p>in japan, where i lived, worked, and studied for four years, they have perfected this process; in the development of an animated tv series or video game, for example, there is a large focus on creating high-quality characters (simple, highly graphic, and visually appealing) that can cross over into other media, produce spin-offs, and be featured on merchandise. this ends up generating far more profits than the sales of the original product. i think that many american video game companies do not appreciate the importance and potential of high-quality, appealing characters.<p>in terms of platforms, our game is planned to be released for the iphone/ipod touch, but could easily be ported to the ipad, which is number one on our list. if successful, it could also be ported to the android. in addition, we would like to make it playable on pcs and macs, though without the touch-screen, gameplay might take a little reworking.<p>...so, how does that sound? thanks in advance for any feedback.<p>(the game i am talking about is actually an active project on kickstarter right now, with one day left to go. you can see it here:

7886351 ask hn: what do you think of leanpub, softcover, etc? i&#x27;m working on a short technical book at the moment and i&#x27;m having a hard time picking the perfect approach to take.<p>leanpub is one of the easiest to get started with.<p>softcover provides a better interface for readers (and a lot of nifty features specifically for technical books).<p>but i&#x27;m also half-tempted to just go solo, publish the thing online for free and sell access to the pdf&#x2f;screencasts via gumroad.<p>would love to hear people&#x27;s opinions about the best way to go both in terms of the best way of writing, the best experience for readers, and also financial results — does being on leanpub actually put you in front of a sizeable, willing-to-buy audience? or do you still need to still give your book that initial marketing push?<p>thanks.<p>:) 2014-06-12 22:24:28 UTC

office (kreisburo) and tell them that you have moved to switzerland. you tell them that you have your own swiss company, and that you want a residence permit, then present your bank statement to show that you are not broke. then you get a 5-year residence and work permit.<p>this is the procedure for european union (eu) citizens. does it work for non-eu citizens as well?<p>how much money do you need to have to show that you are not broke? 2010-05-14 19:19:56 UTC

10058180 sexism is a thing sexism is a thing. probably always was a thing. history is a plethora. there was a time when women could not participate in public life. they were confined to a &quot;domestic sphere&quot;--given away for marriage, responsible for rearing children and managing the house. forget about voting or having a career. forget about walking any path other than the one proscribed.<p>there were also the times when rape was a fact of life, like during every war ever, including the conflicts between &quot;civilized&quot; peoples during wwi and ii.<p>it&#x27;s all still there today in different forms. at the extreme end fraternity culture which objectifies women so totally we need to have national conversation about how rape is bad.<p>but there are also many subtle currents in tech that lead to an exclusionary environment. she&#x27;s not invited to the bar with the guys. she&#x27;s not welcome in the testosterone atmosphere of the game room (someone make another balls joke). she must deal with a number of socially awkward people who have trouble interacting with those who are different. and finally scepticism about her hacking skills. i personally participate in &quot;boy&#x27;s club&quot; activities. i personally am awkward. i personally have some kind of bias where i expect less from female coders until proven wrong. i see these subtle currents in my own actions and experience.<p>and i&#x27;m not even going to get into the seething hatred outspoken women often face in the form of online bullying and death threats.<p>&quot;women need to stop whining about sexism,&quot; is a totally callous response which ignores the ways in which women are made to feel as outsiders. you know how black people faced all this prejudice in the 60&#x27;s and yet some are still virulently homophobic today? i think it&#x27;s kind of like that with tech where people who used to be unpopular nerds don&#x27;t know how to treat the minority in their own midst with respect and acceptance. 2015-08-14 01:35:30 UTC
8888255 ask hn: tutorials for asp.net mvc and c# that are like railstutorial.org? hello hacker news,<p>last year i learned rails using michael hartl&#x27;s excellent rails tutorial. this year i&#x27;d like to learn asp.net mvc and c#.<p>what i loved about hartl&#x27;s tutorial is its comprehensive nature: it introduces readers to everything from fundamental web concepts and common unix terminal commands to ruby, rails, testing, tools and deployments, and ultimately builds a functioning website that you can just share the link to with your friends. i&#x27;ve been searching for similarly thorough tutorials for asp.net mvc, but haven&#x27;t been able to find any. so i figured i would ask here.<p>tl;dr: what are some good resources to learn asp.net mvc for someone who has ~1 year of rails experience? don&#x27;t assume knowledge of c# or visual studio.<p>thanks in advance. :) 2015-01-14 19:00:20 UTC

1447962 ask hn: undelivered email or false claim? i am the client/developer facing girl at our tiny little startup. we have outsourced a lot of miscellaneous tasks to independent-freelance developers in the past very successfully.<p>but recently, this developer we are working with, has come into the habit of responding to emails too late (which lag the projects and hurt our client relations). when inquired, he claims that he had already delivered the email and chances are that i missed it because of possible technical reasons. and he sends in the email again (2-3 days late). this has already happened 4 times during past 3 weeks. is there any way to verify if he is being honest?<p>in short, i would like to know if there is a way to verify false email delivery claims. 2010-06-21 04:32:22 UTC

2384563 how to post an effective job listing the top story right now is about a "highly profitable" yc company looking for a tech lead. that sounds exciting but the ad doesn't answer enough questions to be a useful ad. there are a few big items that the writer has left out. (i'm not looking for a new job, but it drives me crazy to see job postings that are missing such important details!)<p>since hacker news doesn't allow comments on job listings, there's no way to prod the author for more information. so, here's a plea for more information that would help people decide whether to apply to jobs listed here.<p>1. what do you <i>do</i>? you could be doing something social, or something super-technical, or anything in between. that makes a big difference when people think about their relevant skillset. i'd be terribly unqualified at rethinkdb, but maybe a lot more qualified at other yc companies.<p>2. who <i>are</i> you? a little about the existing people would help someone know if there's any personality fit. is the culture sales-driven or tech-driven? what's respected at the company, formal education or youthful enthusiasm? are you in the "get something working quickly" phase, or "get something designed well" phase? are you searching for product-market fit, or are you scaling up?<p>3. where are you? you could be in silicon valley, or the east coast, or outside the usa. even silicon valley is a big place, and someone living in the mission isn't gonna want to commute to los gatos every day. 2011-03-29 21:25:15 UTC

4583190 ask hn: most innovative web frameworks in 2012? almost all of my software development over the past 3 years has been spent building web applications. i build mainly small to medium scale sites (read couple hundred to several thousand daily hits), ecommerce shops, the whole gambit and along the way i've used and tried out tons of framworks, cms solutions, etc. i like rails, play and symfony2, and have recently discovered lift (still haven't made a project with it) but it looks promising. the thing is you can basically build anything regardless, but because i build largely interactive apps ( ajax, server pushing, parallel page rendering, etc), i'm always on the lookout for a good fit in this sector. anyway, i'd be really interested to know what toolsets (front and backend), my fellow hackers use now in 2012 to build ria :) 2012-09-27 22:11:23 UTC

2947693 ask hn: 4 yc founder team? my cofounders and i have been considering applying to yc. we've been working on the project for 2 years, paying the bills by performing industry specific services, and plan to have a sellable prototype by december (we're a hardware startup, which is why we've taken so long).<p>but, we have 4 founders in our current state. i understand that yc prefers 2 or 3 founders, but we've been bootstrapping for 2 years with 4, so does that balance out the higher risk of the 4 founder? thanks in advance for your thoughts.<p>also, just to clarify, our team consists of a hardcore embedded linux/os dev, a back end dev, a front end dev/designer, and a sales/marketing guy (who's learned enough coding to write simple crud apps). disclaimer: i'm the marketing guy. 2011-08-31 21:43:15 UTC

p.p.s.  i am not opposed to working virtually with my team.<p>and yes, i do have money to get this off the ground...<p>best,

45700 eventknower - know the uknowable the instant it happens (feedback on my idea) i came up this idea a few nights ago.  i'm hoping you guys would be kind enough to offer me any kind of feedback you can think of.  i'm still not sure how viable it is.<p>here goes:<p>problem: there are some things i'd like to know when they happen but can't easily get notified right now.<p>examples:<p><pre><code>    *new homestarrunner cartoon
    *last season of 24 released on dvd
    *simpsons movie released on dvd
    *windows vista released (old)
    *nintendo wii launched (old)
    *updates to small software projects 
</code></pre>
maybe lots of people have things like this they would like to be notified about. thus the idea is a website where you can request to be notified of something via a myriad of options e.g, rss, email, sms, etc.<p>it could work like this. you get say 5 points when you sign up. each event you sign up to be notified of costs you a point. if you correctly report when one of the other events on the site happened in a timely matter, you earn points.  2007-08-23 16:43:45 UTC
8181436 ask hn: how to tell what's true from false or right or wrong? as i&#x27;m growing up i&#x27;m learning more and more about life and our universe a lot of what we learn is of coursed based on experiences.<p>sometimes when people tell me things i ask myself is that really true?. for example, a friend and i had a discussion earlier about islam and he is muslim and he told me the way the big bang started was predicted when islam first came out and actually a lot of scientific stuff was predicted in islam&#x27;s first stages how can that be possible?.<p>my point is are we suppose to just believe what we are told? how do you regard something as creditable? a lot of the times when i&#x27;m learning new knowledge i&#x27;m always focusing on the source credibility is that wrong of me to do? i take everything with a grain of salt but if i&#x27;m studying biology and is a book by let say richard dawkings i would credit the information accurate and not distrust it. is that wrong?<p>how do you figure out the truth from false knowledge? 2014-08-15 08:55:49 UTC

3066384 my programmer is a dick...  i don't know how to approach this situation so i'll detail my situation. we started a startup conceptually since 1 year ago, went full force in developing in may, and are now about to get clients/ship product.<p>my partner and i are former web designers/developers who can't do web application programming but can sell ice to an eskimo and have great marketing/business networking experience. we put both of our life savings to get front-end development done (are main product is a dashboard tool). our other (kinda founder) who has been with us since the beginning does the back-end programming, without him it would've been hard. we are paying him about $25/hr below his market pay, but he went to college with me so he is helping with discount. the backend shouldn't be more than about 150 hours of true programming (not including research time).<p>here is the situation. the programmer is a dick. he has a house and baby so we try to cut slack, but he keeps on missing deadlines. he has almost no communication skills when we want to meet and work, he doesn't show passion like a founder. we wanted him to come on board as a full equity stake founder, but we've learned to him this is just a project and that's it. we haven't had that come to jesus talk yet, but we're afraid it may leave us in a bad spot. he's the only one familiar with the backend. it's causing us to lose clients and not gain momentum, not including how our advisors/investors are eyeing us.<p>please any advice will help. we would love to find a new programmer founder, but how do we make the next steps in a crucial time like raising funding? also please note as just a key employee we were going to give him 3-5% equity in the company. 2011-10-03 14:27:51 UTC

(with a list of issues) instead of redirecting the visitor to the final url. there are a few examples on the website that you can check: http://safe.mn/6, http://safe.mn/2, http://safe.mn/3<p>i'd like to get the feedback of the community: what sucks, what do you like, is is just another url shortener for you do you see any additional value, etc.<p>i've just launched safe.mn, it is not complete yet.  the biggest missing part is decent statistics. i'm already logging all the information, but i'm not displaying them yet. let me know if you find anything else missing. 2009-05-29 05:05:40 UTC

8122669 what's the point of hn? is hn for discussion? if it is then why are dissenting opinions, that are well made and not troll-like, down-voted. moreover if down-votes are intended to indicate only dissent (as i&#x27;ve been informed), not indicate low value remarks, then why is it considered beneficial to fade out such remarks.<p>is hn supposed to be a sounding chamber or is the idea to foment useful discussion? perhaps instead it&#x27;s primarily just a link sharing tool?<p>the main stimulus to my question is how time and again good comments [that often i disagree with] are down-voted (presumably, vote numbers are hidden of course). then the site admins deem that these comments need to be made difficult to read. this suggest that high-value discussion is <i>not</i> the point of the site; instead it serves to establish a narrow consensus and silence other voices.<p>so what is hn for? 2014-08-01 20:35:38 UTC

3840752 my day one mac appstore sales there aren't too many data points about the mac appstore, so i decided to let you all know just how lucrative it is to make a great app.<p>my app: http://www.typeli.com
appstore: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/typeli/id503079958?ls=1&#38;mt=12<p>day 1 sales: 
11 (usa 7, germany 2, japan 1, singapore 1)<p>which translates into 10.5 * 11 = $115.5<p>what's most interesting however is the relative performance as compared to other apps. i checked the top grossing list for productivity apps multiple times yesterday, and was very surprised to outperform some apps that apple features on its website. typeli fluctuated in the region between 108th and 150th place.<p>what do you think? is it really that bad out there or am i missing something? 2012-04-14 13:00:00 UTC

3678323 offer hn: how can i help? edit: for the sake of clarity i should state that i am willing to meet with as many people as i can fit into my schedule.<p>who am i?<p>i’m brian!<p>seriously though, i’ve been in technology for a while. i have been through shutdowns,  liquidations, and an acquisition. i’ve worked with a lot of smart people. i’ve led teams in both wonderful and awful company cultures.<p>i'm more of a hn lurker than contributor. here's to changing that.<p>i’m not a vc or angel investor. i’m not looking to make investments and couldn’t even if i wanted to. i’m not a recruiter or head-hunter. i’m just a guy with a range of experience, some free time and an urge to give back.<p>i really like (decaf) espresso and chocolate.<p>what can i offer?<p>i’m offering to meet over coffee, lunch, dinner, in your conference room, at some park somewhere, anywhere in san francisco or the east bay. i can probably be convinced to trek down into the valley. maybe we could even get together in a google hangout or on skype (or whatever flavor of conferencing software you prefer.) i’m more than willing to get together when i’m traveling, if you’re in a place i’m traveling to.<p>i will help however i am able. we can brainstorm startup ideas. help you think about your technology stack. help you think about if/who you should hire and help you craft position announcements. help you interview technical people where i’m competent to do so. obviously i’m not an expert in everything, but maybe i can help you rope in an expert if i can’t cover it.<p>maybe you want to talk about how to get started climbing the technology learning curve or want some help with a strategy to get hired into a particular company or want to know how i’ve navigated awkward conversations about compensation packages. maybe you want to talk about how i filled the gaps in my education because i dropped out before finishing my degree. maybe you want to hear me belabor the point of how you can get a college level education free on the internet.<p>i can even help you practice your chess game.. much in the same way a punching bag helps a boxer prepare for a bout.<p>there’s probably more i can offer, let’s talk about it. i don’t want to waste your time or mine. if i can help i will, if i can’t i’ll say so.<p>what do i want?<p>if you’re a bit cynical, a little suspicious, or do not commonly encounter generosity in your life you may find yourself wondering why i’m doing this. this is a big experiment for me. i like experimenting and doing so on myself instead of others clears up a lot of legal issues. to make things perfectly transparent these are my goals:<p>1. meet people and dramatically expand my network.
2. get out of my own head and see what other people are thinking.
3. find out about cool new things ( and get invited to awesome launch parties. ;] )
4. that warm fuzzy feeling you get from doing good deeds.
5. did i mention how much i like coffee and chocolate?<p>(here's the original blog post: http://malfunctive.com/2012/03/07/the-offer/) 2012-03-08 02:17:46 UTC

2341124 new rule: stop calling my company a lifestyle business - my business partner and i have been working 60-80 hour weeks for 12 years (8 years on this company).<p>- we started our business because we are passionate about the problems we are solving.<p>- my co-founder and i own 100% of our stock and our company is debt free.<p>- we get a nickel's worth of value out of every penny we spend.<p>- our 2010 revenue was $450k, our 2011 revenue will be more.<p>- we have "world changing" funded players that compete against us (although we're regional) and we kick all of their asses.<p>- we are about to close our first m&#38;a deal.<p>- our customers will tell you that our website is way more important to them than facebook or twitter.<p>- we try our best to inspire our families and the people around us.<p>- we fight to win every day and dream of a $20m exit some day.<p>instead using a term like "lifestyle businesses" (that, intentionally or not, belittles our efforts) to describe what we and many other hard working entrepreneurs do, please start referring to our businesses as "ass-kicking-hyper-awesome-style businesses" or something similar. the term "lifestyle business" is not descriptive. thank you.<p>(this post was inspired by this thread: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2337745) 2011-03-18 17:24:16 UTC
251853 are co-founders in the same city really an advantage to a start-up? most founders will tell you (and it's the stance that y combinator takes) that being in the same physical location as your co-founders is critical to success.<p>my co-founder and i seem to work very well at a distance. frankly, i don't see the advantage to being in the same place.<p>sure, very occasionally there are things that would go faster if i could draw them on an actual whiteboard instead of a virtual one. but these moments are rare.<p>basically, i think virtual communication is something you learn how to do. since we're not in the same location, we're very used to using tools and communication styles that provide the same advantage as being in a room together.<p>and there are many, many advantages for us to start an entirely virtual company. primarily, when we do have to grow our company we're going to be able to hire the best people in the world (as long as they have a good internet connection.) this seems like a huge advantage over google, who can only hire the best people within an hour's drive of mountain view. it opens up an entire new pool of talent for us.<p>other advantages:<p>1. no rent for office space and no commute. 
2. we can hone our communications techniques so that we're ready to scale when we inevitably need to have people in multiple cities working together.
3. people get to work in an environment where they're most productive. 
4. we cover more of the world so one of us is usually close to an investor or customer that wants to have an in-person meeting with. 
5. since we cover more of the world the company as a whole has more perspective.<p>as to arguments on the other side, the only one i can think of is:<p>1. it's easier to communicate, and thus easier to get things done. (but with modern communications devices, e.g. a screen recorder to capture exactly what's going on my system so that the programmer can how i produce the bug, i remain unconvinced that in-person speed of communication is anything more than a slight advantage that is greatly outweighed by the disadvantages of not being an entirely virtual company.)<p>are there other advantages to in-person interactions that i'm not thinking of? 2008-07-21 02:05:42 UTC
92629 suggested yc news css patch currently, you can use a line-leading-space to create a pre+code block in a yc news story or comment. this has an intended, usually desirable effect -- the pre+code text does not wrap. if the pre+code text includes a long line, however, there is another usually undesirable effect -- the width of the enclosing block element grows, and then even <i>non</i> pre+code text anywhere on the page fails to wrap. reading even simple unrelated paragraphs/comments then requires horizontal scrolling.<p>here is the above paragraph with a leading space to trigger/demonstrate the problem:<p><pre><code> currently, you can use a line-leading-space to create a pre+code block in a yc news story or comment. this has an intended, usually desirable effect -- the pre+code text does not wrap. if the pre+code text includes a long line, however, there is another usually undesirable effect -- the width of the enclosing block element grows, and then even *non* pre+code text anywhere on the page fails to wrap. reading even simple unrelated paragraphs/comments then requires horizontal scrolling.

a simple fix would be be to add to the news.css stylesheet:<p><pre><code> pre {overflow:auto}

637272 recap of hacker news nova/dc meetup (2009-05-31) quick recap of the first hacker news readers nova/dc meetup (http://www.meetup.com/hacker-news-nova-dc):<p>we had 17 people come out. not bad for a group that didn't exist before last wednesday. started at 8pm, ended after 11pm. the beer flowed like wine, and consequently, so did the conversation. almost everyone had some sort of side project in progress, at least one person had recently launched, and another is launching in just a few days. quick poll early in the evening indicated a contingent of rubyists, groovyists, lispers, and erlangers among us. probably more, should have taken another poll later on in the evening.<p>sincere thanks to everyone for how well the bill was handled. everyone paid their own share, which made it nice and easy for the group and for the waiter.<p>any suggestions for the next meetup?<p>some ideas are iota (http://www.iotaclubandcafe.com/), continental (http://www.modernpoollounge.com), east potomac driving range (http://www.golfdc.com/sites/courses/layout11.asp?id=691&#38;page=38684), quarterdeck (http://qdrest.com, crack and eat crabs), or bowling. 2009-06-02 02:53:44 UTC

1066774 ask hn: career path for founder of a failed venture backed startup? hi guys, this is anonymous for obvious reasons.<p>say i'm the founder and cto of a venture backed startup. we had a good run but, for a variety of reasons, the company fizzles after a few years (and series a and b).<p>now i'm a 26 year old college drop out (from a top tier school), with some pretty cool experience (i've written huge software from the ground up, ran a company, hired/trained a dev team, etc).<p>so, what are my job options? i have the contacts/team/etc to start another company, but i don't have an idea that really excites me and i feel like i need a few years without the huge ups and downs of a startup. (i have offers to go be 'director of engineering' or something similar at a few other startups, but i'd like something a little slower paced for a while ...)<p>without a college degree can i go to the big guys (microsoft, google, etc?). can i go become an associate at a vc firm (it actually seems pretty fun, and i think i could do a better job than a lot of the associates i interacted with ...)? any other career ideas? 2010-01-21 06:45:05 UTC

218624 how does one self fund a start up properly? i have a startup (i plan to set up as an s-corp) and i'll want to add some of my personal funds to it as i earn side money, but i want to know the right way to go about it. if i pay myself with equity can i create additional shares, or do i have to transfer shares? if i consider it a loan to the corporation, do i need to specify terms of repayment?<p>i'm concerned about regulations regarding share sales as well.  i'm more concerned about the company making money in the long run than getting a loan repaid, so shared might be the right way to go, but i'm not sure.<p>any websites that go over this for the self-funder, or person seeking a family and friends round?<p>once things get going, i think i can manage it with it's own funds, but the first steps confuse me.<p>ps - i did submit this over the weekend, but the timing (around midnight on saturday) may have prohibited responses.  thanks. 2008-06-16 13:48:30 UTC

2542723 ask hn: why would i write web apps in anything besides php? i recently considered moving all my web apps from php to something else, mainly because i was bored and it was an excuse to get proficient with another language.  however, the alternatives were not written with web scripting in mind.  python and ruby were both designed as stand-alone programming languages with web wrappers added later.  beyond those two, i couldn't even think of a third language that was even worth considering.  so i stayed with php because php was designed specifically for web scripting.<p>my question is: what benefits are there to writing web apps in any of those other languages that weren't designed specifically for web apps? 2011-05-12 23:10:04 UTC

8341565 ask hn: are there startups that went open-source and succeed? here is where we are:<p>we have a valid product, paying customers, currently $50k mrr and we are growing.<p>we have competitors, they are bigger, got huge investment rounds (we only got small seed round from friends), yet we have a better product. much better!<p>how do i know? customers, customers who left them, told us clear and simple. this product is far beyond what we have had with a and b.<p>now, a and b are strong with pr, most of it are exaggerations (typical to pr), one even get to post almost every week at hn&#x27;s front page.<p>to really really beat them, we will need to inject some cash and start the pr channels, conference attending and spend a lot of time in marketing. i hate doing that. i am happy to develop the product. very happy to meet customers and present the product, and strongly convinced the world deserve to know about our product.<p>open sourcing will make the product better, will make it well known and might even speed up our growth.<p>i will be happy to see companies that started as closed source, then went open source, and succeeded.<p>got some examples? 2014-09-19 17:50:40 UTC

1114338 tell hn: enabling buzz exposes your full name and contact list on google profile this caught me by surprise, so i thought i'd share it. you can go back to your google profile settings and uncheck "display my full name so i can be found in search" and "display the list of people i'm following and people following me."
i think the privacy settings are all around lacking, but this "feature" was pretty opaque to me--they gave me an option to "save" my google profile when enabling buzz, but since i already had one set up i thought this to be an irrelevant step. i had to poke around for a while to realize that my profile had been changed. 2010-02-10 05:51:38 UTC

6468295 ask hn: how many "self-taught" programmers and how did you do it? i was wondering to what degree the hn community of programmers is self-taught.<p>1) how did you learn to code? totally self taught from books and rtfm &#x2f;&#x2f; self taught plus moocs or comparable resources &#x2f;&#x2f; some classes in college but no cs degree, remainder self-taught &#x2f;&#x2f; self taught plus a developer bootcamp or some non-degree related formal education &#x2f;&#x2f; cs degree and personal efforts<p>2) when did you start learning (perhaps informative because of the recent rise of moocs)?<p>3) at what point (if yet) did you start working as a programmer professionally relative to your initial efforts?<p>i had been wondering about this for a bit and the discussion here (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=6467914) motivated me to finally post it.<p>administrative note: i&#x27;m below 200karma so i can&#x27;t make this a poll, if an admin wants to throw some polling categories in here that&#x27;d be cool too.<p>edit: added quotes to the self-taught in the title since i realized that with the advent of stackoverflow and various other social learning tools that there are very few who can truly claim not to have learned at someone else&#x27;s digital knee at some point or benefitted from the currently robust community that exists online now. 2013-09-30 07:52:11 UTC

3441511 ask hn: please critique my crowd-sourced patent debunking business concept hello folks,<p>i briefly wanted to run this concept by you to see what you think of it. i would greatly appreciate comments/critiques/anything else that comes to mind. thank you very much!<p>concept:
it's a social game where you and your friends band together to solve tasks. a law firm somewhere wants some digging done regarding a patent they are working on invalidating through prior art, and they'd like a big blob of people to look around the internet and see if they can find something compromising. as a team, you pick one of these tasks and start looking around for prior art regarding this patent you're trying to invalidate.<p>as a player, you pick the role of either a finder or a grader. as a finder you look around the net for information on the target patent and submit links to that info. a grader's job is to rate the submitted data from other teams: you filter out spam, you give low grades to data that's obvious and trivial (like the first results on google) and give good marks to data that you feel is extremely important to the case. teams with the highest scores are rewarded monetarily with portion of the sponsorship money for a job well done.<p>the idea is two wrap the underlying mechanics into a social game shell, analogous to, for example, travian/planetarion/mafiawars. why? because ideally an average joe with no expertise in ip law could play this game, and so through sheer numbers the data could beat in value what other companies are doing, who rely on domain experts to perform the searches.<p>you compete with other teams to get as much quality data as you can within the given amount of time. at the end, this filtered data is sent over to the company sponsoring the search and they use it to supplement their case for debunking the patent. (this is the business plan part of the concept)
additionally, and this isn't very fleshed out yet, as part of the player experience, you learn more about how ip law works, you trade information with other teams and you solve quizzes for points.<p>so, what do you guys think, is this something you'd actually participate to as a player? does this sound fun? any big gaps?<p>thanks again! 2012-01-09 05:05:41 UTC

64786 ask yc: your google adwords experience? i have started to advertise my site on adwords and so far the experience has been quite frustrating. the ads are not showing, after 4 days i still see zero impressions for all imaginable key words and their diagnostic tool does not really help, just says: "this keyword does not trigger any of your ads".<p>i have increased my budget to ridiculous $5cpc and gigantic monthly budget but nothing seem to work. at this point i am getting paranoid of things suddenly starting to work and getting a huge bill from google.<p>i searched for help here and there, but mostly found the same suggestions over and over, that do not work for me: "increase your budget!", "pick better keywords!" and "wait 3 hours for servers to pick up your campaign". <p>anybody had similar and frustrating experience? is it even possible to spend, let's say, less than $2k a month advertising on google ?

2335953 i think i'm looking for a technical co-founder the other day i finished up with my project, www.bulletinburst. however, after some feedback, there are quite a few things that new to change and be added to make it the success i'm sure it can be. in light of adennis4’s ‘looking for a tech co-founder’ thread -http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2332349 - i’ve decided to bite the bullet (pardon the pun) and convince myself that i’m at the stage where i can’t work on this alone anymore.<p>what is it?<p>it's a lean online press office where companies can host their press releases in a streamlined environment that provides convenient, filtered access to the latest information to feature journalists, bloggers and interest readers. in essence, it’s a weapon in one’s digital marketing arsenal. although it's not strictly innovative, the pr industry is not a zero-sum game. because it’s not innovative, the product is market-validated, and there is certainly a lot of room for growth and revenue.<p>biggest challenge:<p>shortage of skills – the site was built using php and i’ve got my limitations with it. the core functionality was contractor made.<p>in full disclosure, i do have a sort-of partner (who’ll be building the analytics part of the product once we get to that stage), but he’s not in just yet.<p>what i’ll provide:<p>obviously i’m the business guy. i could say that i’m not just that, because i know my way around css, html5, jquery scripts, some sql, a touch of php here and there and non-relatedly, i’m familiar with a bit of ruby and rails, but you don’t want to use a hammer to drive in a screw. i’ll obviously keep a close tab and assist with deving where possible, up until the stage, where a better core version is ready, but at that stage i’d relinquish myself of the duties of that aspect.<p>my 9-5 is working as a digital media account manager in a massive digital media agency, so i know my way around the industry. i’ve got contacts in the right places, and i have a proper launch plan ready (by proper, i mean more than just a post on hacker news, facebook and twitter hoping to get spotted – a solid launch plan).<p>the details:<p>i don’t care where you’re based. i’m in south africa so i don’t expect much response from people around me. i do want someone with a firm grasp of english.  i’ll be willing to give up a third equity to somebody that commits with full-on passion.<p>email is in profile. 2011-03-17 12:56:44 UTC

729324 ask hn: is a home server good enough ? hello hn!,<p>the idea:
i'm planning to launch an image storage service that allows users to upload photos from their iphone. think of it along the lines of twitpic wherein the user has a native iphone application that can upload photos from the device's camera. i don't intend to copy twitpic, i'm just using it as an example to illustrate the general nature of the service.<p>the problem:
after applying for an iphone developer's license, my budget is now fairly close to $0, leaving me no money to rent a server.<p>the proposed solution:
i have a 512kbps internet connection at home. it's supposed to be 512 up &#38; down, but my isp oversells its bandwidth as any isp does, so this tends to vary wildly depending on time of day.
using a combination of dydns and port-forwarding i can set up a computer at home to be a server. the computer in question is an acer with a 2.5ghz intel processor &#38; 2gb of ram. this computer is only used occasionally for checking email or light wordprocessing. 95% of its time will be dedicated to this application alone.<p>the photos coming from the phone will be resized and compressed down to about 20kb per photo. there will be some additional metadata that comes with the photo like username, geolocation, etc. which brings the total data outgoing from the phone to about 25kb per photo.<p>once receiving the photo, the server will send back some confirmation data which weighs in at about 4kb. if the user is requesting their profile for editing, the server sends back data that is about 25kb, ie; username, email, thumbnail of avatar, etc.<p>the server app is written in php with a smidgen of .net for some image manipulation.
the estimated frequency of use is perhaps 4 photos per day per user.<p>the question:
this setup is only to launch the service and gain minimal traction, say 5000 users or so. that means it has to run for 3 months ? ( i have no idea how long it'll take to get 5000 users)
the general idea is to get the service running with some users, iterate to the 2nd version of the product with the feedback received and then approach an investor.<p>is this set-up good enough ?<p>thanks hn !<p>-------------------------------------<p>home computer details here :

8942934 why is flickr so broken? there are photos i&#x27;ve taken that are publically available, but aren&#x27;t in my photostream, because apparently my photostream is not collection of all photos i have on flickr. i think it&#x27;s because the lightroom plugin interacts with the photostream as if it&#x27;s any other album, so if you happen to have uploaded a photo to flickr through a means other than lightroom, or upload it via lightroom but then remove it from lightroom or delete your catalog accidentally, lightroom just magically deletes those photos from your photostream--they&#x27;re still on flickr, but the only way find them is if you already know the link from somewhere else, or if you find them from the albums page on flickr, which will show you photos by a user that are not in that user&#x27;s photostream, the page that shows you all of a user&#x27;s photos. if the photo is not in an album, and you have lost the link to it, that picture no longer exists, or at least cannot be found, unless you can guess the number assigned to it. 2015-01-25 14:06:38 UTC

4166020 ask hn: as an average coder, should i try to sell programming ebooks? a few months ago i started to poke around with clojure. as this is my first serious dance with a functional language, i've been compiling a lot of notes and code samples as part of the learning process.<p>a thought has wedged its way into my brain; i'd like to take my informal scraps of knowledge, put together an ebook and sell it. not sure about the length yet, but my hope is that it would be short, dense, and cheap ($15/100 pages max). kinda like "learn python the hard way" for clojure, but with training wheels.<p>problem: i'm not a known person in the software world. heck, i've done some websites, written some scripts, done some sys admin stuff, but i'm just an average guy with average skills.<p>i know credibility helps sell copies, but i kinda feel like selling such a product would be (for lack of a better word) cheating people. to be honest, this thought has surfaced in other ideas as well. i find myself unable to create and sell things, despite a &#62;tremendous&#60; urge to do so.<p>i'm just a mere mortal. should i wait until i'm more skilled to make and sell these types of things, or try to get better by doing it? or not even worry about such things?<p>have any of you ever experienced this feeling?<p>maybe this is just be a problem of low/no self-esteem, but any thoughts would be very much appreciated. 2012-06-27 07:58:18 UTC

9985094 how to send product recommendations to mail chimp users hello guys, i am trying to come up with a solution to send email newsletter with product recommendation to our users. this is what i have:
1. user-list on mailchimp.
2. all users segmented into different categories.
3. products with unique url, price, and description stored in my parse.com database.<p>what i need:
1. find out products for each segment of users and send an email campaign to that segment.<p>what i have done:
1. run a cron job to find out products and send it to mandrill to the targeted segments.<p>this solution is very slow and takes forever to finish as it is trying to send a transactional email to each user.<p>ideally i would like to just get the products list and send it to a campaign on mailchimp for each segment.<p>if anyone has an experience in such integration, pointers to it would be much appreciated.<p>thanks, 2015-07-31 23:21:58 UTC

562337 ask hn: my idea has just been launched...by someone else. now what? i know, some of you are sick of too many "ask hn"-submissions. however, this is something that  bothers me and i'd like to have your opinion on this.<p>i have an idea for a startup for quite some time now. i'm still convinced that this idea is 1) very good and 2) could be easily monetized. long story short: i just found that another startup has launched a service similar to my idea. when i discovered that startup i lost all my motivation to keep on working on this idea. i have to admit that it really was just an idea so far, i.e. i was working on the wire framing and trying to get a team together.<p>now my question: what would you guys do? since it is not exactly executed like i would've done it and i could try to launch it first in my country (germany), i'm not sure whether to give this idea up or just go for it. it would be easy to dismiss, since it is just an idea so far. on the other hand, i'm really convinced that this idea is very good.<p>on what criteria would you guys base your decision whether to go on or dismiss that idea? 2009-04-14 20:55:53 UTC

1722625 ask hn: tips for buying a domain in redemptionperiod i am looking to purchase a particular domain name that when doing a whois lookup shows the status of "redemptionperiod" with an updated date of sept. 1st 2010...<p>i've been trying to look into the subject and have found many conflicting reports of the best way to go about getting a domain name if it does in fact expire... most recommend pool.com or snapnames.com<p>i've been seeing some sources that say that it takes 30 days once the domain has entered the redemptionperiod + 5 days of pendingdelete, others mentioning 75 days for the whole process.<p>so if anyone has any experience with domain name acquisition once it has gotten to this step i'd appreciate some tips, such as when and how to go about getting it. thanks 2010-09-24 04:07:37 UTC

8944823 what web framework would you suggest for a band? i have some definitively non-tech savvy friends with a band who tour constantly.  i would like to make a simple website for them.  not something i would update full-time, but something that would let them enter tour dates that dynamically expire, email their fans tour dates and host links to their facebook page and cafepress for t-shirts and let me write some basic code once in a while to expand it.  is there a wordpress theme that would help with this?  or some other framework?  thank you. 2015-01-26 00:11:53 UTC

10200178 how can i stay grounded/rational while working at a startup? i never thought i&#x27;d find myself dealing with startup culture (even after reading hn for so long), but i recently joined a startup at my college (cs senior here). i&#x27;m really glad to be working with everyone on the team, as i feel like my college career was seriously lacking this kind of experience. we&#x27;ve gauged some interest from local companies about our product as well as a considerable number of other students. everything seems to be going well so far, but i guess i can&#x27;t shake this nagging thought of &quot;people don&#x27;t know what they want&quot;, and that nobody will actually use it despite initial research indicating so. so i guess my question is, how can i continue to look at the product rationally instead of having a warped view of somebody who&#x27;s put a considerable amount of time stressing out over every detail? 2015-09-10 19:50:39 UTC

 a) what is a typical bootstrapping time for a startup, that is in a lucrative but overcrowded market?<p>b) what are some of the best ways to market on a shoe-string budget? planning to go to youtube, any thoughts on this?<p>c) any crowd source fund/site for hi-tech startups? 2012-07-07 12:33:05 UTC

6239163 ask hn: new founder in need of advice hey guys, launching a startup and need some advice. i&#x27;m the technical co-founder&#x2f;cto, he is the business development guy.<p>my cofounder seems to think vc are more concerned with appearance than performance... he thinks the most important thing in a vc&#x27;s mind is that we have an office with a full team in it every day. i disagree.<p>he thinks that having our team all in the same city&#x2f;state is necessary to be taken seriously by investors. i disagree.<p>i&#x27;m constantly getting yelled at any time there is a bug... in his mind if a vc sees a bug, we&#x27;re finished. my opinion is that as long as we&#x27;re forthcoming and open and honest about mistakes and communicate with our clients and investors, we&#x27;ll be fine (to an extent).<p>he wants a 90&#x2f;10 split because its his idea and he&#x27;s put about $80k into the business so far... i think 65&#x2f;35 is more fair because i&#x27;ve built the software from scratch, have put in about 500 hours so far (no pay), and will continue to work around the clock for free until we&#x27;re profitable.  10% is pretty unfair right? in his defense, he has crazy connections in the vc industry, has sold a (domain) company before, and has pretty deep pockets. that&#x27;s the only reason i&#x27;m comfortable with going less than 50&#x2f;50. i&#x27;m a sr engineer making $150k&#x2f;yr now and i&#x27;ve worked for several software startups. also i&#x27;m functioning currently far beyond my cto capacity -- managing contractors, handling finances, and more.<p>i also don&#x27;t think we should raise money... he&#x27;s got tons of money and we&#x27;re already making money.  our burn rate right now is about $10k&#x2f;month and most of that is going to our designer. at the rate we&#x27;re at, we should be break even in then next 3 months. i don&#x27;t see a need to pull in a few million dollars and give up 1&#x2f;3 of the business. 2013-08-19 19:26:10 UTC

8449460 offer hn: i will build you a working mvp for $3000 hi,<p>i will build you a working mvp for $3000. i have 3 weeks’ time at my disposal. email me at whyrolldice@gmail.com<p>who am i?<p>i am full stack developer with prior startup experience (sole owner, successful exit by sale, but no big figures to brag about). i have major experience working in nodejs, angularjs and php. i have worked on a lot of projects involving heavy api usage. i know how to find my way in a documentation. i know how to deploy apps on linux environments. i can work with pretty much anything (working with the stack i know will be faster, obviously). i am okay at designing. i have built some nice interfaces, but none of them are artistic.<p>i am very open to learning new technologies, if you already have something going on, on a different stack.<p>what kind of products will i prefer?<p>products that involve new tech (bitcoin, etc) and would optionally allow me to open source some of the work and build up my github profile.<p>why am i doing this?<p>i have been freelancing on and off, for 5 years now and<p><pre><code>  - i have no projects to put in my portfolio.

  - my public github profile is almost empty.
</code></pre>
i would like to do something about that.<p>why do i have no projects to show in my portfolio?<p>well, most of the work i have done is invisible. i have built scalable rest back-ends for mobile apps. i have built private web interfaces for large subscriber management systems. i recently built a product for someone working in a corporation. but the person abandoned the project citing financial issues and it was never launched out in the public.<p>why is my github profile empty?<p>i never felt the need to write something from scratch (thanks to the node community for such great modules) and i couldn’t open source any of my clients’ work. 2014-10-13 16:55:26 UTC

2419952 ask hn: how does an outsider develop industry knowledge and contacts lets say you where a motivated person with experience in the software industry but wanted to create a product to sell into the restaurant industry.<p>what steps would you take to gain the knowledge and contacts required to sell into an industry that was not your domain?<p>a few things that come to mind are..
1) read how-to and dummy books on starting a business in the new industry.
2) subscribe to industry specific publications
3) go to local conventions and meetups that have owners and operators from the new industry.<p>what else would you do to immerse your self into an industry for the sake of eventually selling into it?<p>i think this is a problem for a lot of entrepreneurial software developers since our work is generally focused on the implementation of technology as opposed to the creation of business process models. 2011-04-07 15:59:56 UTC

7457386 ask hn: how do you cope with your browser tab overload? hello hn,<p>we&#x27;re a small startup in the process of building a chrome browser extension to address tab-overload.<p>we realise there&#x27;s been many attempts to solve this (onetab et. al), but to us, they feel like they&#x27;re just sweeping the problem under the rug. we&#x27;re trying to work back to the root of the problem, so we have a question:<p>do you find that your browser tabs continue to accumulate and multiply? if so, why do you think that is (i.e. do they stay open as a todo list?); and how do you deal with it right now?<p>any insight you&#x27;re able to share about this problem would be enormously helpful. we know it&#x27;s a whopper, but we&#x27;re determined to solve it and we need your help.<p>thanks so much :)<p>p.s. we put together a more formal survey over here  ( http:&#x2f;&#x2f;bit.ly&#x2f;1lftnmk ). if you&#x27;d like to beta test, or even play with some wireframes (brutally honest feedback is very welcome), just drop your answers and details into the form. 2014-03-24 09:48:38 UTC

233819 ask yc: what domain name registration service do you use? i heard many times that there are some companies that practically steal your domain, or even, they register their own information besides yours.
probably you will tell me, "hey did you heard about enom.com, godaddy.com, etc"... but the thing is that the worst comments i heard, are coming from that big companies.. and i recently read(via slashdot), that these companies also allows their employees to bid on domains.
so i'm wondering, wich domain registration service do you trust and can recommend to do a "secure" registration process, and don't be scare about losing domain names. 2008-07-02 04:57:36 UTC

i&#x27;m a student who was applying for a summer internship and got rejected from all the companies to which i applied from the cv phase. didn&#x27;t even get to the interview phase. i got rejected from facebook ( twice ) even with a referral, got rejected from dropbox, got rejected from quora, didn&#x27;t even get a reply from microsoft. i thought that my resume is good enough for someone in my age but apparently i was wrong. is there anything that bad in my resume (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;mbassem.com&#x2f;assets&#x2f;files&#x2f;mohamedbassemresume.pdf)? thank you. 2015-04-27 12:24:21 UTC

3747046 where to start in computer science? where do i start as a person with an interest in computer science? obviously this is a vague question, so let me clarify.<p>there are a few things that i have little interest in, like os, game development, and ai. however, software development, database design/management, server administration, data communication... and that's just what is coming off the top of my head.  i've been floundering and flailing around aimlessly in the world of computer science for a few months now, with some prior experience in very minor things like html, jscript, php (very little) and other web design related things. i am a 24 year old business student with only a semester to go before graduation and have come to the conclusion that if i could do it all over again, i would definitely be doing something computer science related instead.<p>i have access to resources like lynda.com for free through my university, and know about mit opencourseware, but i sort of feel like a kid in a candy store being overwhelmed with everything when trying navigate through all the possibilities. it's simply overwhelming.<p>in your experience and knowledge in the field, what was the best way you found to progress step by step from one subject to the next in a productive manner? what are the things that you know that you consider abso-freakin-lutely vital to your arsenal of knowledge and skills?<p>i don't know really where to start exactly. i feel like i have the basic ideas of the abstraction of programming understood, but now that i'm here i don't know where to go next and what would be the most useful. the area is simply far too complex and diverse and i am simply far too beginner to try to decipher it all.<p>please help. thanks. 2012-03-23 20:20:43 UTC

1822196 ask hn: which compiler book to pick? hi,<p>for years i have been interested in programming languages and their implementation. i have made many attempts over time to create my own (experimental) programming languages, mostly interpreters.<p>the problem is, my knowledge of this area of computer science is fragmented, to say the least. i picked up things here and there, but i never learned how to properly implement a compiler, interpreter, virtual machine, or even a parser.<p>so, i have decided to pick a book and work my way through it. i just don't know which book. they all seem equally intimidating. a few candidates that i am considering are:<p>- the dragon book (new version, 2006); seems awfully big though, making me wonder whether i should pick a book that is a bit less comprehensive first, then come back to this one later;<p>- the dragon book (old version, 1986)<p>- engineering a compiler, by keith cooper and linda torczon<p>- parsing techniques - a practical guide, by dick grune; focuses on parsing though rather than the whole package<p>so my question is, which of these books, or any others, do people recommend? (my main interests would be interpreters and languages that compile to bytecode, either custom or targeting existing vms. "traditional" compilers that produce a standalone executable, not so much.)<p>thanks in advance! 2010-10-23 01:20:17 UTC

906916 ask hn:  is there a spam filtering web service? after reading resig's post about google groups, i was wondering if there exists a web service that specializes in filtering out spam.<p>i would imagine i could create a new filter, send training data to a filter, and send data to a filter and have it return the likelihood of it being spam.<p>anybody have first hand experience using a web service like this?  if so, has it met your expectations? 2009-10-28 01:26:06 UTC

471252 ask hn: how do i protect my start-up from law suits? (usa) hello everyone,<p>i've been tossing around a couple of ideas for side businesses that i could try out while holding on to my day job, and then see where they go from there.  i'm turning over the ideas of selling herbal supplements (not a la tim ferriss, i swear), and/or selling consulting services as a patient advocate.<p>i understand that 95% of a start-up is just getting off your butt and doing it, but i find that i stall when i think about possible legal issues.  what if someone with a severe ragweed allergy goes into anaphylactic shock over chamomile contamination?  what if somebody gets the idea that i should pay their $100,000 chemotherapy debt because the health insurance company won't, despite my best efforts?<p>incorporating sounds like putting the cart ahead of the horse, but i don't want to put my personal assets at too much risk unnecessarily.<p>what steps would you suggest to shield my business and my family from liability? 2009-02-07 17:12:42 UTC

5899863 ask hn: social micropayment system for scientists? i always see papers being posted and a lot are behind large paywalls or only available to certain schools, or only available through large publishers with shit sites and huge prices which i assume the scientist doesn&#x27;t see any of.<p>does something like this exist? i want to make access to journals and discoveries easier while at the same time awarding those scientists.<p>this could be great for grad students and the like. however, i have no experience with this. i&#x27;m not even done my undergrad and i&#x27;m not in science so i have no idea how publication works.<p>my goal is to develop a site where users can upload their papers. readers can setup a daily&#x2f;weekly&#x2f;monthly budget with bitcoin&#x2f;real money and whatever they read, a percentage of that money they have in their &quot;wallet&quot; would be divided by the number of papers&#x2f;articles they read.<p>how do you feel about this hn? i know flatrr exists which is similar, but i want to target the science community and integrate bitcoin as well. 2013-06-18 15:37:15 UTC

197219 how is raising money like buying a car? source: comment by dharmesh shah at http://venturehacks.com/articles/buying-a-car<p>1. just like getting bank financing for a car, raise capital before you raise capital. have some angel/seed money in <i>before</i> you talk to vcs.<p>2. “drive it off the lot price” = “what percentage of the company will i have once the deal closes and how much cash do i get”? this captures stuff like option pools, legal fees, etc.<p>3. test drive = actually have some social time with your potential vc. if you wouldn’t want to have a drink or dinner with them, youl shouldn’t take their money.<p>4. create competition - but don’t call it an auction or a bidding (even though that’s actually what you’re trying to do). if you only have one potential investor, you don’t have a deal, you have desperation.<p>5. go online - just like watching this video is a good way to know the basics, read things like venturehacks to learn more.

2495991 tell hn: the secret to launching is removing unfinished features the secret to launching your start-up is removing unfinished features.  it's that simple.<p>many things you think you need in your first version can usually wait.  that unfinished social feature?  remove it.  that broken button to let users tag content? comment it out.  the extra benefit of removing those unfinished features is that users won't appreciate them if they're in the initial version.  if you add those same features later, users will actually notice the features and get to share your thrill of improving your product. 2011-04-29 01:32:26 UTC

3079636 26-year old iconoclast steve jobs' address to the academy of achievement in 1982 #steve #jobs steve-jobs #wisdom #advice #brilliant #innovative #audio #academy_of_achievement #26-year-old-steve-jobs #apple<p>http://soundcloud.com/ashish007/26-year-old-iconoclast-steve<p>steve jobs' commencement speech at stanford in 2005 is widely known, but this short 7 min audio of 26-year old jobs, when he addressed the academy of achievement in 1982 is not that known, but full of his trademark brilliant insights, wisdom , humour, wit &#38; even some self-deprecation.
it just blows my mind that even at 26, before having kids, he was so wise &#38; almost sage like in his insights, but also was witty, funny &#38; self-deprecating<p>at ~ 5:30, he comes across like a true humanist &#38; world citizen, with concern not for a company, country, but for the entire world as a whole<p>a must listen... listening to his address is probably the best 7 minutes i have spent in my life :)<p>what does it mean to be intelligent &#38; creative
1. get different experiences &#38; make new connections among those unique experiences
2. ability to zoom out 
3. going to paris &#38; be a poet for a few years
4. go to a 3rd world (developing) country &#38; see (suffering) lepers
5. fall in love with two people at once :)
6. try lsd ? [a]
7. sit down &#38; talk with a zen buddhist
8. we "take" from a giant pool of things (food, clothes, language, math) ..
to be able to put something back in that pool is the most ecstatic feeling in the world 
9. being a guardian of (mother) earth for future generations<p>i am sad like everybody else, but i believe jobs' spirit will continue to live on &#38; inspire millions of people world over, for generations to come.<p>rip steve

63121 the thinkgeek 8-bit tie a few of us monkeys at thinkgeek had this great shared dream a few months ago. in it, the whole world was 8-bit, just like the video games we grew up on. we found ourselves having to leap from platform to platform, to search for pieces of the triforce of wisdom, and to fight scary mutated plants and animals. the music was awesome (and still stuck in our heads) but the coolest part was what we were wearing: a tie. but not just any tie, an 8-bit tie! 2007-10-04 18:08:00 UTC

9867961 judg: disruptive social network ios hello everyone ,<p>let me introduce myself. my name is amaury de buyser i&#x27;m a 20 year old belgian and i&#x27;ve just launched my social network &quot;judg&quot; on ios. :)<p>dl : http:&#x2f;&#x2f;go.judg.it<p>we are alive since the 19th of may. press link :
-http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.independent.co.uk&#x2f;life-style&#x2f;gadgets-and-tech&#x2f;news&#x2f;judg-the-social-network-that-makes-social-climbing-
completely-overt-10324095.html<p>-http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.konbini.com&#x2f;us&#x2f;lifestyle&#x2f;judg-new-social-network-admits-social-climbing&#x2f;#.vxtage4gxbm.facebook<p>what makes judg unique ?<p>-on judg the content quality is higher than on instagram due to our voting system. today people are leaving facebook because of the poor quality of the feed content.<p>-we finally give our users the opportunity to say « i don’t like this post » with our rating system. for a long time, facebook users have been asking for this feature and we have found the perfect way to give it to them without the mean aspect. mark zuckerberg said in december 2014 that he wouldn&#x27;t allow the dislike because he thought people would be mean to each other. judg is the proof it wasn&#x27;t true.<p>vidéo : https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=b7j2on2su9c<p>-judg is fun and less serious than its competitors. it&#x27;s a game and it&#x27;s rewarding.<p>funny facts about judg:<p>•    judg is the result of a strong teamwork but also a family work. indeed, all the founders are coming from the same family. what better way to build trust and cohesion within your team?<p>•    we almost lost hope when apple rejected our app. the reason? “your app includes features, such as rating other users, that can result in mean-spirited content”. what!? that’s our entire concept questioned here! phew… after removing the category “selfies” (because it targets people too much) they finally accepted it.<p>thanks for reading !<p>feel free to send me an email : amaury.debuyser@judg.company<p>amaury

2911665 ask hn: any solutions to the "porn problem"? i have a close friend who claims to be 'addicted' to internet pornography.  he has been trying to find software or any service to help prevent access to these types of websites.  in his search, he has found that all the one's out on the market are quite easy to bypass and are usually built with a "parent administrator" in mind.  he approached me to see if i knew of any software or could build something to prevent his access to porn.<p>as a hacker (still consider myself a beginner), this is quite a lot to tackle, but i am honestly intrigued by the challenge.  personal views aside, i took a purely technical approach to this.  one of the biggest weaknesses with current software is the ease of disabling it, proxy bypassing, and the massive lag it sometimes causes on computers.<p>now, despite your views on the issue, i was wondering what creative solutions fellow hackers may have. is there any way to create a fool-proof anti-porn software or service?  are there any startups that work in this space and are coming up with solutions to this? 2011-08-22 07:14:32 UTC

9104974 ask hn: how do you find craftsmanship-oriented dev jobs? hi hn,<p>i am a web apps developer with no cs degree, and much of my knowledge has come from self-directed study. i&#x27;m currently working in a place that doesn&#x27;t have much focus on software craftsmanship as i understand it. my hand-wavy definition would be something like: an ongoing and management-endorsed effort to make the code easier to understand and maintain, and to make the developers better at writing such code. however i don&#x27;t have a lot of experience to help me flesh out what this vision of better dev culture looks like.<p>i&#x27;m looking for a new job in the next few months (in denver), and i&#x27;d really like to find somewhere invested in software quality, and in ongoing employee education. i try to study on my own but i feel like i would benefit much more from a mentoring relationship of some kind. so far my only thought has been to look for companies where software is part of the product, so as to stay on the profit-generating side of the books and at least have a chance to make a business case for ongoing training.<p>do any of you have suggestions for finding companies like this? do they exist, in any kind of numbers? or am i asking for too much? thank you. 2015-02-25 02:42:16 UTC

9337208 ask hn: separating searching for problems from work and life i recently got out of the hospital with myocarditis and pericarditis. i originally thought i was having a heart-attack but being a healthy 25y&#x2f;o man that was ruled out pretty fast. after a few days in the hospital they had absolutely no conclusive cause for my condition. i&#x27;ve been suffering a major amount of stress lately which lead to this condition. they gave me a paper on stress cardiomyopathy and it makes complete sense to me as two weeks earlier i was having panic episodes due to stress and i knew that i would give myself heart problems if i continued. freaky stuff how powerful the mind is.<p>regardless, i&#x27;m sure i don&#x27;t need to say but i&#x27;ve been doing a lot of thinking. it all boils down to some core problems. negative thinking: focusing on bad things that could happen, lack of confidence, trust issues with people.<p>however i&#x27;ve now realized something: part of this way of thinking is fundamental to how i work. the most crucial part of my job as a sysadmin&#x2f;engineer is finding problems and solving them and finding ways to improve existing systems. it&#x27;s completely in my nature to find problems and then solve them (i&#x27;m self taught). however i think lately i&#x27;ve been focusing on so many problems that it&#x27;s gone out of control. i realize this now as i analyze photos on flickr (photography is a hobby of mine). i look for the problems in the photo, look for room for improvement, then leave without gratification on to the next one. seeing this pattern outside of work has triggered a red-flag.<p>what i&#x27;m asking is how do more experienced and like-minded people handle this? how is it possible to separate looking for problems in work and life? how is it possible to find positivity in problems? how is it possible to take it easy when you&#x27;re constantly looking for efficiencies because it simply isn&#x27;t good enough?<p>please share your stories and perspectives on this. i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one who&#x27;s encountered this problem. 2015-04-07 21:13:49 UTC

(or better yet, only w/o the prefix)<p>- if there is already a draft for a feature you have and is good, stick to it.<p>- as soon as 75% of the browsers (or another fair big number) have implemented that feature it becomes a standard. period.<p>sincerely,

2500625 ask hn: ______ is to python as k&r is to c? i'm in need of a book recommendation for learning python (not learning <i>programming</i>, just adding this language to my repertoire).<p>my learning method is more "start coding something, and refer to a reference book frequently" than "do these lessons and you'll eventually learn enough to start coding something you actually care about".  a good <i>reference</i> is dense and to the point; it makes it quick and easy to look up both the syntax of individual features, and the thinking behind them.<p>basically, my ideal programming book is kernighan and ritchie's "the c programming language" -- i want that, but for python. 2011-04-30 13:59:52 UTC

3257115 how my very first iphone app (version 1.0.0) got featured in the app store we submitted our very first iphone app (http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/localuncle/id473554413?mt=8) about 3 weeks ago to the app store and about 2 days ago we were featured in the app store. it's called "localuncle" and it gives you the ability to know what's happening anywhere in the world by sending questions to people who are checked-in on foursqure. think quora meets foursquare meets magic.&#60;p&#62;here's the proof: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=197084127038309&#38;set=a.131140903632632.33967.124227507657305&#38;type=1&#38;theater&#60;p&#62;or just go to the app store to the "featured" and "new" section and you'll find us.&#60;p&#62;how did we do that? well, we just built a great app! literally the only thing we did was build an app, submit it and we got featured! we haven't had any press whatsoever cause we wanted to softlaunch our app and prevent a #faillaunch like color.com. little did we know that version 1.0.0 of our app would already be featured on the app store!&#60;p&#62;we're seeing an amazing amount of downloads and couldn't be happier.&#60;p&#62;so our advice is: focus on building a truly useful and nice-looking service. the rest will take care of itself! good products always surface to the top and rise above the crowd.&#60;p&#62;if you have any further question, shoot me an email to philip@localuncle.com. 2011-11-20 03:00:48 UTC

7656806 ask hn: advice for someone who can't get out of a hole hi hn! i wish to remain at least partly anonymous but i will personally respond via email if anyone wishes to post theirs.<p>for context of the situation: 2 years ago i graduated with a very expensive degree in advertising &amp; pr from a reputable california school. it set back my parents retirement a great amount, even with scholarships. my father said it&#x27;s &quot;all good&quot; but it still weighs heavily on me. during that time, i took on many school projects, started a freelance web practice with a friend, and had a couple internships - one with a major advertising agency. from my web business and internships, i have some incredibly good references.<p>now, two years post graduation, i am very much unemployed (rejection email in comments). i have submitted an insane amount of job applications in several fields [but i really want to be with a young company that i can take responsibility] and have sent even more emails and physical mail.<p>i feel completely stuck &amp; out of luck. it seems that what can go wrong; has, even outside the job hunt. i&#x27;m pretty desperate to get a job and move because the home living situation isn&#x27;t great and i&#x27;m sick of spending my days watching ted &amp; academic earth lectures. i can&#x27;t professionally code, but i can do &amp; enjoy just about anything else. i think i&#x27;m at my best when under pressure and i am able to learn and comprehend new things fairly quickly. i just want to work.<p>what are your thoughts hn? what might have i done to get myself in this hole? how should i get myself out of it? thanks! 2014-04-27 20:50:33 UTC

2959540 ask hn: junior hedge fund programmer - what is fair compensation? i'm a self-taught programmer w/ 0-1 year of professional experience. my current income is pretty dismal, and the recruiter (third-party) forced me to disclose it. now i'm worried if that might drag down the offer. i can't accurately assess my value, as i don't have something concrete like a cs degree to base it on.  i'm also afraid i'll be meek about negotiation, if i'm asking for something thats way off their range.<p>it's a multi-billion dollar hedge fund in nyc w/ very low headcount. i'd say the project workload is higher than average because of a small dev team, and its a fair balance of front/middle/back office work. its a discretionary (non-quant) fund.<p>1) what range should i expect to be fair? (salary + bonus)<p>2) is it unethical to negotiate directly with the employer (go around the recruiter)? i imagine the recruiter just wants to close a deal, and not really fight for the best offer.<p>3) if i shoot too high, can the offer get pulled before i'm told its out of their range? if i say "i'm expecting x" can they say "we're sorry, that's too much, we decided to go with applicant b" ?<p>4) i'm reading about negotiation (especially here on hn). everything from "don't say the first number" to "say the first number (price anchoring)". i actually have a figure in my mind that i believe i'd be happy with. its slightly higher than the top of the range i was quoted by the recruiter. would it be better to just say "i expect x for this position" and be hardnose about it, or to say "i was expecting something between x and x+20%" and negotiate? 2011-09-04 15:31:54 UTC

4465326 prototype of idea: last.fm tagcloud shirts i came up with this idea a year ago (or maybe two), i don't remember.<p>it is very simple: last.fm gives you the artist you most listen, and usually teenagers are proud of their taste and want to show what they listen nowadays.<p>this website would allow to buy a t-shirt with a tagcloud of your bands/musician you most listen, based on your last.fm account.<p>i also made a little prototype:
http://www.patriciotarantino.com.ar/labs/lastfm/<p>i am pretty sure i am not going to develop, mainly because i don't know anything about t-shirt making proccess, but if anyone wants to refurbish the idea, or use as it is, i would be glad to see it implemented. 2012-09-01 22:16:15 UTC

5028091 a gift for the hackers it companies are failing to secure devices connected to the internet, leaving them open to hackers. this shocking report reveals how anything from your pins to your passport could now be accessed online.&#60;p&#62;"is this your pin? is this a letter you received from your bank? do you have a hp e-print scanner?" the young man answers yes to every question, stunned that all of his information was accessible on the internet for anyone who wanted to see it. and he's not alone: the wealth of information available is staggering. from shop owners whose security cameras can be watched and controlled remotely, to medical records and confidential documents for international companies like unilever, orange and klm, it's a bonanza for any would-be hackers. while it would be simple for the it firms who provide printers, scanners and software to make the system more secure, they don't see it as their problem and argue that attending to basic safety protocols is a bit of a marketing nightmare. "there are people who know all about how this works, security-wise, but it's too much trouble to explain all that." one company went so far as to call consumers who didn't know they had to change their passwords "idiots". as the rate of technological change continues at a frightening pace, do technology companies have a duty to prevent our privacy being eroded?&#60;p&#62;for downloads and more information visit: http://www.journeyman.tv/?lid=64861 2013-01-08 19:56:26 UTC

3325491 ubuntu and the (third?) world i have been using ubuntu for quite some time now. i've installed it on my previous laptop, and on this one. both relatively fast laptops, i developed on them, played few games, and watched a lot of video. 
ubuntu, however, has proven to be a problem. you will disagree with me on a lot of this, but i think ubuntu provides a very bad and painful user experience. for instance, flash is a major problem. i have tried a lot of solutions, and it persists. videos freeze and browsers crash. skype quits every two minutes, and if it wasn't for my roommate's mac, i would have broken up with my girlfriend, with whom i am maintaining a long distance relationship. open office is just not microsoft word, and they need to quite trying. spotify needs wine, (i'm starting to think i need that too), and every time it's on it says i am on the wrong platform. they may be right. 
why is skype refusing to fix the damn problems despite the long queue of comments in the software center? why do companies ignore linux versions? they are always either the last to be developed or not developed at all. 
it seems that with ubuntu, there is always something to fix. it's not necessarily a problem; i learn a lot. but it's not about me. an os like this won't stand a chance here. and here means the third world. 2011-12-07 19:36:50 UTC

but, i&#x27;ve heard they are not?
i know java, and i&#x27;m learning javascript, and so far they are very similar at a glance...<p>so, what are the similarities and differences between them? why the similar name?

8622095 ask hn: $45k wages unpaid. what should i do? hi hn,<p>hope i could help some help here. i don&#x27;t really know where to start, but here the facts:<p>our employers started to have troubles to clear pay-check since june 2014. 
the ceo went to sf to raise money.
they promised us to clear all the pay-check no-matter what happen.
they gave us some cash to pay rent&#x2f;eat&#x2f;reimburse loan these last months.
they owe us a total of $45k.
the company is a llc, hq is in texas.
we work from china.
international team (fr, us, cn, kr).
for some reasons, the ceo ask us to shutdown the sales until we get some investors [it would be easier to find investors?].
they send us an email few weeks ago saying to start to find an other job, and wait for the money until we get investors. 
email saying we could sell everything in the office. we did it.<p>we have a website getting many quote requests [at least 4 a day] for machines from $200 to $1m. rank pretty well for some machines on google.
i was thinking about selling the website to maybe get some money from it.<p>now i realised that there was many signal for me to quit the company. however, i was blind by the promise the ceo made us, and thought that everything would be ok. lesson learned, the hard way. we all start to find jobs and try to move on. however it put some of us in many trouble (need reimburse loan, next rent etc...).<p>if you guys have any advices, i&#x27;ll be happy to hear about it.

8286686 ask hn: should i go for mba? feeling torn and down. please please advice hi ,
i have been lurking on this for past couple of months and posting first time.  sorry for the long post.<p>i am from india currently working on h1-b visa in us. i have 7 years of experience. over the years i have worked on primarily in bi and data warehouse area.  technically i do okay ; not the super coder kind of good but not noob as well. lately, i am feeling torn between multiple choices that i have to go from here.<p>1.  i have studied engineering in the past. i would like to go for mba. however, it is becoming very hard to land job. i am confident that i can land at least in top 25 school in us.  doing mba mean i will put 2 years more in study ; will empty 30k i have accumulated so far and will be in debt for around another 80k.
even after that finding decent paying job going to be major challenge.<p>2.  getting job ( or even reply ) is increasingly getting difficult. i completed project management certification from reputed university but employer doesn&#x27;t seem to care.  my current job pays okay but nothing great to expect there.  plus, it is increasingly becoming dull day by day. i am yet to learn hadoop and related big data technologies.  by realistic expectation learning these technologies is going to take time.<p>3. i have couple of ideas for startup but united states law does not allow to start business on visa. going back to india and working on startup is altogether different story ( won&#x27;t go in much detail but been lived for 25 years i can tell you that it will be x100 times difficult than in us ). 
not sure what to do at this point. struggling internally to make any kind of decision and feeling frustrated day by day.<p>many of you have worked on startups, achieved quite a bit of success and could have been in similar situation. what do you think would be best way to move forward ? 2014-09-08 19:29:39 UTC

7611040 ask hn: spouse not on the same page curious if anyone can share some experience with marriage. i married someone who isn&#x27;t as intellectual as me. she was generally supportive of my tech interests and career ambitions when we were courting. at the time she had a job (though she had massive student loans). a few years into our marriage, my wife occupies (shall i say demands) a lot more time than before. she doesn&#x27;t work anymore either (suffered job loss so is going through a bit of emotional stress - so essentially a couch potato - unlikely she will find a job at her previous position). we are in our mid-30s. wife wants to turn homemaker, and have kids. i&#x27;m without any kind of support network. i make decent money in tech (120k+) so should be able to support a family. but feel overwhelmed. i thought my mid-30s was going to be my last chance to do something entrepreneurial. if we have a kid and just my income, that dream is gone. any one else go through something similar? 2014-04-18 20:10:13 UTC

1703197 review my weekend html5 project: dropmocks i had an itch to scratch around making it easy to share sets of images with other designers and thought that i could use the new drag and drop file support to solve it. dropmocks was the result after a quick weekend of hacking.<p>it's built on an app engine backend, and the uploader relies on the pushstate and the file api from html5, so it only currently works in chrome 6 and firefox 4*; supporting other browsers would be the first post-hack step if i were to take it further.<p>an example gallery can be found here: http://www.dropmocks.com/mser 2010-09-17 23:33:57 UTC

260684 ask hn: best way to handle email as a startup? hi all,<p>email has been a big headache for us.  our service doesn't send spam, or in large quantity, nor newsletters. we are only sending confirmation emails and/or notifications.<p>on our server, we implemented reverse dns, spf record, and domainkeys to get through all the email filters (or attempt to...).  gmail hasn't really give us any issue.  we were able to get through yahoo mail thanks to hn.  however, we are starting to notice all the registration emails being send to hotmails are getting bounced, and as far as i can tell... they aren't fake email addresses.<p>as a startup, do you recommend us to keep handling our emails ourselves?  or would you rather license out your emails to 3rd party handlers?  i am already considering the 2nd option because this has been a persistent headache, and i would love to spend more time on actually coding...<p>any tip or recommendation would be greatly appreciated 2008-07-29 16:10:15 UTC

8374198 updates to y combinator diversity stats? a kapor center for social justice post from about a year ago stated that y combinator has had no black female founder alumni (neither did techstars, an org with a founder whom i greatly admire). i&#x27;m wondering if this has changed? i saw this really insightful article by sam, but i didn&#x27;t come across any diversity stats elsewhere - and none on ethnic diversity.<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;tech.co&#x2f;y-combinator-sam-altman-sexism-2014-07<p>i also saw this somewhat scathing critique citing the same challenge: 
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;valleywag.gawker.com&#x2f;everything-thats-wrong-with-y-combinators-sexism-in-tec-1610990450<p>i must admit, i think the emphasis on &quot;tech founders&quot; and &quot;technical co-founders&quot; in the age of massive offshoring, outsourcing, and open source technology is part of the pipeline problem. i&#x27;m a woman of african descent who started coding in college but found it was a slow and tedious option compared to other solutions for building out business solutions on the web.<p>while i still dabble when necessary and have successfully built out my own products, i find it exclusive in terms of network and cultural associations (especially when funders proclaim to want cozy relationships between founders) to place the &quot;coder-builder&quot; burden on competent entrepreneurs who should be resourceful enough to work around limits to their own technical skill sets (even techies - generalists and specialists alike have them) - especially with funding and the ability to hire &#x2f; offshore a team. so long as ip and rights are address from the start, why further limit innovation?<p>i appreciate any answers regarding ethnic diversity in yc and thoughts on the diversity in tech topic. ethnic studies was one of my minors at cal and i think one of the biggest problems is a lack of solution-oriented dialogue. i found it so encouraging and refreshing during techcrunch to see moderators willing to be uncomfortable and discuss it. although they skirted around the topic a bit, i saw it as a sign of progress. 2014-09-26 18:49:12 UTC

7592890 ask hn: how large should a project be before open sourcing it? i recently made the jump from finance to computer science and i am loving it - i&#x27;ve been trying to build as many small projects as possible in order to learn as quickly as possible. i think one project in particular, findhn.firebaseapp.com, actually has the potential to be useful to people so i would like to open source it. that way, i could hopefully find people to work with, continue to learn, and collaboratively make the project better.<p>however, the project is really tiny, i am pretty inexperienced, and it would be a significant commitment to anyone that might decide to contribute. with these factors in mind, should i go ahead and open source it? is there a certain size&#x2f;popularity level a project should be before open sourcing it? should the maintainer have a certain experience level? i am confident in my ability to learn quickly but i don&#x27;t really know what i&#x27;d be getting myself into. what kind of a commitment (time or otherwise) is it really to maintain a small open source project? i&#x27;d love to hear any personal stories on the matter.<p>alternatively, i&#x27;m thinking that i could find a more established os project to learn from first or find someone with a bit more experience to kind of show me the ropes with this project. advice? 2014-04-15 16:52:13 UTC

9660263 ask hn: how does a typical vc firm hear first pitches? i am not a &quot;well-known&quot; entrepreneur by any stretch, which may have something to do with it, but just today i got my first response from a vc firm about how i would go about making a pitch to them.<p>here&#x27;s what they told me:<p><pre><code>  once you have a product you can send your business plan to our
  general inbox and then our investment team will review...
</code></pre>
now i will be the first to admit, i am by no means familiar with the process, but i was kind of astonished when i read this.  the vc firm is in columbus oh, and they certainly (by their website) appear to be involved &#x2f; specialized in technology startups, so i am almost certain they don&#x27;t get anywhere near the same number of pitches a vc firm in sv might get.  yet for some reason i&#x27;ve always been under the impression that the &quot;pitch&quot; is an in-person meeting between the entrepreneur and the vc firm.<p>is this a red flag?  what should i make of this? 2015-06-04 16:19:52 UTC

6382501 ask hn: why do you hate advertising as a business so much? with the twitter ipo, the conversation about paid advertising as a &quot;necessary evil&quot; has come up again. i simply don&#x27;t understand what people have against online advertising.<p>online advertising is a tremendous step forward that does help &quot;the little guy&quot;. maybe not your average mom and pop store but thanks to adwords, facebook ads and sponsored tweets.. smbs can now cost-effectively advertise, test products etc. on the other side of that, consumers are exposed to solutions that fit their needs. i&#x27;ve found tens of products and services through facebook ads that i would not have found otherwise.<p>so there are certainly organic&#x2f;free ways to gain new customers but nothing scales as nicely or as quickly as online ads. i see many people more excited to see companies like pebble or nest but a lot of the reason why these companies exist is because of advertising. smbs like pebble or nest use small budgets to reach a wider audience and build their businesses. it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;d exist without digital advertising but unlikely.<p>i think mass media and shady ad practices have painted a terrible image of the advertising business model. advertisements that prey on human weakness, pop ups, auto-play etc... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the advertising model is completely broken.<p>anyway, i&#x27;m thankful to this new age of advertising which allows my business to run and introduces me to apps, services and products i want to use.<p>why do you guys hate ads? 2013-09-13 19:13:52 UTC

8286000 ask hn: aren't self-signed certificates preferable to unencrypted connections? i&#x27;ve had all kinds of issues in the past (as a sysadmin) testing systems with self-signed certificates (before we have real certificates issued). for example, testing a new mail server, a client website, etc. most systems will show an alert, and many just refuse to work entirely (e.g. smtp relaying) without a significant amount of configuration change (which then has to be undone later).<p>but isn&#x27;t that better than nothing? even if my blog has a self-signed certificate and you can&#x27;t say for sure that &#x27;this blog is run by so-and-so&#x27;, isn&#x27;t that better than a wholly unencrypted connection? ssl seems to be used for two purposes, namely encrypted connections and validating the remote server, but surely encrypted connections alone are a sufficient benefit? and yet, if all i want to do is have a secure channel, i have to (theoretically) pay a certificate issuer yearly to prove that i am who i am, as if encryption requires i prove my identity.<p>it would make a great deal more sense to me to treat self-signed certificates the same way we treat http sites: give no notification to the user whatsoever, unless they go looking for it. browsers could also have a &#x27;strict mode&#x27; enforcing the current behaviour (require authentication) for environments or users which prefer it.<p>the major problem i see here is that sites where you <i>do</i> want to guarantee certificates (e.g. facebook.com, google.com, bank of america, etc) would be difficult to guarantee that you were connecting to the correct site, since mitm attacks against your ssl connection would be treated like http connections and the browser would let them proceed as if nothing was wrong. i&#x27;m not sure if there are tangible ways around that, but it feels worth looking into. 2014-09-08 17:26:08 UTC

961677 camels and rubber duckies - "how much should i charge for my software?" one of the biggest questions you're going to be asking now is, "how much should i charge for my software?" when you ask the experts they don't seem to know. pricing is a deep, dark mystery, they tell you. the biggest mistake software companies make is charging too little, so they don't get enough income, and they have to go out of business. an even bigger mistake, yes, even bigger than the biggest mistake, is charging too much, so they don't get enough customers, and they have to go out of business. 2009-11-25 19:44:39 UTC

5260877 screwed by incubator, what do i do with my dead company? hi everyone,<p>i was part of a (non-yc) incubator in the bay area.  we were given a small amount of money equity-free and we were directed to use the incubator's high-profile silicon valley attorney in forming our corporation.  the attorney and founder of the incubator tried to throw out our ceo and replace them with an associate who worked for one of their vc sponsors.  this ended up being a pretty awful experience, and we left the incubator early.<p>given this experience, the founders have agreed that this company is not going anywhere but we're unsure what to do.  we're obviously crushed, but we have plenty of other opportunities, so we're okay.<p>but to complicate it further, the attorney is now demanding payment for their services which total about two-thirds of all of the incubator money we even got (which has already been spent), and the attorney's firm has a negligible amount of equity in the company.  nobody other than the founders has any equity, and we didn't raise any capital.<p>so, hn, what have you done with your dead startups, especially after they've been legally formed as a delaware c-corp?  and, how do make sure the ghost of your startup doesn't haunt you for years to come?<p>thanks! 2013-02-21 22:15:57 UTC

6205010 ask pg: can we limit reply count/depth? the popularity of hn is only growing. this is not a bad thing, but it does mean that every discussion can and will take more turns, more different directions. i&#x27;ve watched as so many different online forums for conversation have broken down under the strain of a growing user base. you either end up with uber-deep threads that only the participants, if anyone, can follow any longer, or you get a dog-pile of nearly-identical responses to popular posts.<p>i understand that hn has always been an experiment, so why not experiment with a different way to manage the conversation? writing a top-level post is more challenging than a follow-on reply. i suspect you&#x27;d find that top-level posts generally display more novel thought than the majority of reply posts (not all -- there are some very high quality replies -- but most).<p>similarly, when a reply thread gets very deep there is a good chance that the conversation has strayed from what is interesting to the general population. at this point, it would probably be better to continue the discussion in email or some other communication medium.<p>i still come to hn primarily for the comments, but i find myself increasingly opening a comment link only to find a first comment followed by a page of replies to replies to replies; almost a straight line across and down my browser window. sometimes i will scroll to see if maybe the second top-level post has a different take or covers a different question, but more often i close the page and move on...<p>...obviously this is just a thought. i wonder if there other things hn might try to maintain the level of discourse with its ever growing audience? 2013-08-13 10:58:39 UTC

we want to get on one of the major accelerators this year.
and the question we have now is whether to focus on user acquisition or develop more demo functions.<p>if we focus on user acquisition, we will try to enhance user experience and add more admin functions.<p>if we focus on more demo functions, we will develop tutor-focused functions (like questions creation and curation), which can be the real differentiator for us. however, we don&#x27;t think we have enough bandwidth to develop full-fledged, marketable functions. they&#x27;ll only be demo functions to show where we&#x27;re going.<p>thanks in advance for the comments. (also, if you could provide any feedbacks on the site, that&#x27;ll be great as well.) 2014-02-14 20:26:36 UTC

1951835 ask hn: best way to transition from free beta to paid? i recently took over an app that has been in a free beta period for about year. there are a decent (yet still relatively small) number of users that have been on this free beta.<p>i'm planning on transitioning the application out of the 'beta' and to a freemium subscription model.<p>some users would qualify for the free level of service, some would be at paid levels of service after the switch.<p>what's the best way to handle this kind of change? migrate all beta users to free plan and let them decide to upgrade? let them keep current level of service and give them x days/months to enter payment information? give them a discount over announced pricing plans?<p>curious to hear how other people have done this. 2010-11-29 21:24:27 UTC
