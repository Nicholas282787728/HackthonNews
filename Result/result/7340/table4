4727112 ask hn: what's a good dev laptop for outdoor use? after reading the minimalism story the other day &#60;http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4721645&#62;, i got to thinking: until laptops with an e-ink screen exist, what <i>is</i> the best laptop for outdoor development?<p>i've been trying to get healthier recently, and a big part of that is spending time outdoors. however, without a laptop that's difficult, since much of my time is spent developing websites and web apps.<p>does anybody have a recommendation for a good laptop, or class of laptops, that would be ideal for outdoor, in-the-sun, disconnected development? for example, going to the urban woods in my area, i can already guess that i'll need ample battery life and a cellular connection, plus some sort of screen that won't completely wash out in the sunlight. 2012-11-01 12:22:00 UTC

2902403 itunes connect: new features for apps now available we are pleased to announce the following new features to help manage your apps on itunes connect.<p>“metadata rejected” added to app review status. you can now resolve metadata issues that have been identified by the app review team without having to recompile and resubmit a new binary for review.
if you submit an app and the app review team determines that any metadata items are not compliant with our guidelines, your app status will change from in review to metadata rejected. metadata items include your app name, keywords, rating, or category. screenshots and icon images are also considered part of a metadata rejection if they are determined to violate the app store review guidelines. rejection details for apps with the metadata rejected status will be available in the resolution center.<p>to resolve an issue, you will need to edit the metadata in itunes connect. your existing binary will then be reused for the review process.<p>bundle id is now editable before binary submission. if you have not submitted a binary for review, and your app is not using game center or the iad network, you will now be able to edit your app's assigned bundle id in itunes connect.
to change your app's bundle id, click edit next to your bundle id in the manage your applications module. 2011-08-19 05:56:58 UTC

6468333 launching xiffe we are launching xiffe today. xiffe is mobile prototyping in a jiffy.&lt;p&gt;xiffe lets you create prototypes for your apps in a xiffe using a simple drag-drop web interface. all your data is stored on the web making it easy to access anywhere on the internet. you can even access the prototypes on your iphone to see how the app would look on an actual iphone. no using photoshop or illustrator or powerpoint, digging through layers and getting the right components. just drag-drop components on the canvas and you are done.&lt;p&gt;xiffe offers a little extra compared to other prototyping tools available on the internet.
	•	ios 7 compatible design library - xiffe provides the complete ios 7 flat ui library along with the standard skeuomorphic graphical elements - bars, buttons, keyboard, pickers etc.
	•	customization - unlike most other mockup tools where you can change only basic properties for an element, with xiffe, you get complete control of the elements to closely match the properties that apple provides for its controls. so you can control the elements to the same levels that you can with apple xcode
	•	icon sets - xiffe provides you with a large icon set. we have included vector icons from font awesome that can instantly be customized by you for both size and color.
	•	app previewer - you can simulate an entire app workflow by linking screens through button clicks and specifying transitions between screens. so your clients and collaborators can see exactly how data will move through the app.
	•	collaboration - share the app with anyone using xiffe so you can collaborate in real time.&lt;p&gt;with this version, we are releasing only the ios prototyping tool. other platforms will be added soon with later releases. we have android and windows 8 in the works already.&lt;p&gt;we are still in beta and continuously improving our design and user experience. try out xiffe and do send us your feedback. 2013-09-30 08:06:22 UTC

3999644 ask hn: tame a mess -- backup & revisions across several systems? i am a freelance mobile developer, and have many projects spread out over 4 systems - 2 win7, mac osx and ubuntu. some of the projects need to be checked into client source control.<p>what is a good way i can backup, keep personal revisions and share across all 4 systems? the thing that makes it tricky is some clients have their own git or subversion repositories.<p>here are my thoughts:<p>on my main system, have two mostly mirror directory trees: one just containing source pulled from client repositories, and another that is my "working" source tree which contains everything including copies of client files (but excludes their source control system files.) the working tree would be checked into a local git repository.<p>so for the various tasks i need to do:<p>update from client repositories:<p>after updating from client repositories into the client tree, i would merge all source files (no svn or git files) to the complimentary location in the working tree, then checkin any changes to my local git repository.<p>committing to client repositories:<p>merge source from the working tree (no svn or git files) to the client tree, then commit.<p>sharing between other system:<p>the other systems would just update and commit to git on my main system.<p>backups:<p>backup the git repository, the client "tree" and the "working" tree to an external drive.<p>any problems with this? is there a better way to do it?<p>thanks 2012-05-20 18:46:06 UTC

9074162 ask hn: do your companies reply to rejected candidates? i&#x27;m applying for software engineering positions right now and in the past month or so have interviewed with many companies, from small startups to massive mncs.<p>one surprising aspect has been that some companies&#x27; recruiting departments have been non-communicative after the interview. like, no reply, even after i&#x27;ve sent a reminder&#x2f;check-up email (i&#x27;ll wait a bit more than a week before sending such an email).<p>what&#x27;s going on here? is it actually a thing for companies to not reply to rejected candidates? that seems really rude. again, i&#x27;m not talking about cases where i blindly sent in a resume; this is after one or more technical rounds.<p>maybe candidates just slip through the cracks? still, it seems bizarre that a recruiter wouldn&#x27;t take 10 seconds to send a generic rejection email after their engineers have taken multiple hours of their time to interview me.<p>to be clear: i&#x27;m not trying to complain (too much); my job search has been successful. i&#x27;m just trying to figure out if this is standard practice, what it means, and how to react in the future when it happens. 2015-02-19 14:38:02 UTC

i already checked nomadlist for some info but it&#x27;s not quite informative about the region and the list of cities is not quite exhaustive.<p>i also know that there are a bunch of tech hubs across the region, so the list of the cities to go to should be exhaustive.<p>what do u think 2015-04-30 12:35:11 UTC

  comment:

  my partner and i absolutely love your blog and find the
  majority of your post's to be what precisely i'm looking
  for. can you offer guest writers to write content to suit
  your needs? i wouldn't mind publishing a post or
  elaborating on many of the subjects you write concerning 
  here. again, awesome web site!
  ==============================
</code></pre>
* i've changed last name slightly (which still wouldn't match the name of the email) and the domain of the email address in case of the incredibly unlikely event that this email isn't spam.<p>so, the submits come from an ip, and a seemingly legitimate user agent:<p><pre><code>  ==============================
  ip: 5.135.35.83
  user agent: mozilla/5.0 (windows nt 6.0) 
  applewebkit/535.1 (khtml, like gecko) chrome/13.0.782.112
  safari/535.1
  ==============================
</code></pre>
i guess the question is: what's the end-game here? are they expecting a reply to the email address and then things kick off from there? is this seeding to get through a couple legitimate emails to start conditioning spam detection algorithms?<p>these emails don't contain the most basic of spammy info:<p><pre><code>  1. no obvious keywords
  2. no urls
  3. no selling of a scam
</code></pre>
it just really seems to me that it's crafted to get a reply. i just don't know why. there is obviously a purpose to this relatively new breed of spam (at least to my eyes), and i'd really be interested to know if anyone has the answer.<p>for some breadth on the messages, here's a sampling of others:<p><pre><code>  ==============================
  hello there! this is my first visit to your blog! we are a 
  team of volunteers and starting a new project in a 
  community in the same niche. your blog provided us 
  valuable information to work on. you have done a 
  wonderful job!
  ==============================
  superb post however i was wondering if you could write a 
  litte more on this topic? i'd be very thankful if you 
  could elaborate a little bit further. cheers!
  ==============================
  awesome issues here. i am very satisfied to look your
  article. thank you a lot and i am taking a look forward 
  to contact you. will you kindly drop me a e-mail?

1808764 template specialization in c++ - it really is useful i always tried to stay away from templates in c++. i knew a little about how it works, but it seemed to me it's rarely useful in regular (non-library) code, and makes debugging pain, so why bother.<p>today i've wrestled with problem that has simple and (imho) elegant solution using template specialization, it was surprising for me that it is so simple and just works. so here it is:<p>in my game i need a way to interpolate between two given frames of game world - physic thread computes next frame at 30 hz, and graphic thread draw some interpolation between last 2 frames as many times as it can (or at screen refresh frequency, if it can).<p>so every property of every in-game object should keep old and new value, and should make it possible to interpolate between these values.<p>for this to work i wanted to do template class 
oldandvewvalue&#60;t&#62;, so in-game objects will keep its properties in such classes.<p>but oldandnewvalue should allow interpolating between these values at any t between 0.0f and 1.0f.<p>for numerical properties (int, float) it is easy - oldandvewvalue will just have method<p>t get(float t) {return _old * (1.0f-t) + _new * t; }<p>it will even work for position and velocity, because vector class has operator+ and operator* defined.<p>but what about orientation that is a quaternion - it has operator+ and operator<i>, but interpolating quaternions that way will look wrong.<p>or what about properties like
weapon</i> activeweapon;
etc?<p>i've started thinking about making class heirarchy: baseoldandnewvalue, numericaloldandnewvalue, weaponoldandnewvalue, quaternionoldandnewvalue, etc, etc, and making virtual methods in them. but it seemed ugly, and i'm lazy.<p>so i've written this prototype program and it worked (it uses std::string instead of quaternion or weapon* - just to show idea).<p>http://www.nopaste.pl/u01<p>it turns out template specialization will do just fine here, without making convulted class hierarchies, wrapping fields or anything.<p>sometimes c++ is almost a expressive as hip functional languages.<p>hope it helps someone with similar problem. 2010-10-19 21:07:03 UTC

1356437 monitis launches a new plan to help universities stay green and cut costs monitis, the leading provider of the world’s greenest, all-in-one, hosted network and application monitoring suite, today announced the academic plan - a comprehensive, all-you-can-eat (or unlimited) package and pricing model for schools, colleges, and universities.<p>the new academic plan offers everything found in the traditional monitis suite of tools, but also includes unlimited monitoring.  so academic institutions, be they schools, colleges, or universities select one of 3 possible packages – small, medium or large based on  the number of servers they need monitored, and nothing else.  it’s that simple.<p>starting from just $248 per month, the academic plan, is a perfect offer for schools with even the tightest of budgets, as all added-value services are free – the number of parameters to monitor, the number of network devices, and even alerts including live voice and sms alerts.  as a result, educational institutions have the luxury of employing a single monitoring solution instead of the standard current mix of multiple open-source software solutions (e.g. nagios, zabbix, zenos, cacti), commercial software solutions (like solarwinds, whatsup gold), and external end-user experience monitoring services (like gomez, keynote).<p>given that monitis operates on a saas model and is based in the cloud, it managers throughout academia can avoid the cost, stress, hassles, and limitations of using traditional software-based monitoring tools.  with monitis there are no upfront license fees, no updates to manage, and no servers to maintain.  getting set-up and running with the complete suite takes only 5 minutes, and as monitis offers the industry’s most reliable notification system, users can rest easy knowing that they’ll be notified even if their system or network is completely down.<p>but in addition to all of the professional advantages monitis offers, it is also the greenest monitoring solution available today.  because schools, colleges, and universities that use monitis don’t have to buy and operate their own monitoring servers, they save massively on electricity bills and minimize their carbon footprint.  indeed, with the average server’s electricity bills running approximately us $1,050/year, academic institutions save more money on electricity bills than they will spend on monitis’ services.  the savings increase even more dramatically when the cost of acquiring and maintaining the server are included, as well.<p>said monitis’ founder and ceo, hovhannes avoyan, “for schools, colleges, and universities around the world, monitis’ academic pricing plan is a no-brainer.  take the world’s leading-edge monitoring technology, wrap it in a pricing plan with a tco that’s even lower than open-source systems like nagios or cacti, and then factor in the carbon footprint reductions, and monitis has an offer for academia that is truly unbeatable.” see more at http://portal.monitis.com/index.php/monitis-for-education 2010-05-18 04:04:02 UTC

1272573 ask hn: please rate my idea localized cheap hobby kits business hi,i have been really impressed by the startup culture that is portrayed here. before discovering this site i wanted to get a phd and live my life as an academician. but after looking at lives and works of fabulous startup people i am greatly inspired to do something like this on my own.(not like the phd idea is totally abandoned but something is pushing me towards the startup culture).<p>i have cooked up an idea, not a very original one, not exactly complying to the web apps mostly discussed here and not something nobody else has ever done.<p>ok enough of a preface, now the idea. and the idea is... drum roll ... a online hobby electronics kits shop. ok ok don't abandon me now. i know its very very oooooooollllllllllddddd concept but there is a twist here.<p>let me tell you something about the scenario where i will apply this idea. indian colleges are freaks for robotics and electronics. everybody (who is not even in the electrical engineering branch) wants to be an electronics engineer. but there is a catch. they can learn everything from the internet in theory. but in practice they can't. there is a language barrier. it is a culture, at least in my state, that there education till high school is done in gujarati(our states language).<p>so the idea is to make the material provided with my kits localized. i would translate these materials in gujarati and advertise this fact and to make the kits cheap.there is one startup doing the same thing in my own city robokits[1]. but there are two problems in there model in my view. 1) their kits are really expensive 2) their kits are focused only on robotics.mine would be focused on getting them up and running on basic concepts of electronics.<p>it would be a totally online shop (mostly because i don't have money to rent an shop or time to maintain one as i am in first year college). the kits will have to be cheap as hell, nothing above 500rs (10usd). i have friends in most of the engineering college in the city and other cities of the state, so those can help me with shipping. payment can be in cash handed to me or my operative (read friends) or by demand draft.<p>the other aspect is marketing. i am planning to advertise 1)by word-of-mouth 2) byt spamming orkut and facebook groups 3) by setting up desks at techfests at different colleges.<p>all this i have planned till now (working on and off on the idea and site and cheap kits design for about a month).so i ask people of hn to rate my amateurish idea(specially anyone from india). 2010-04-17 03:47:34 UTC

1136619 is apple's iphone more 'open' than android? i recently switched to a htc hero on the three(uk) network.  i was excited to use google's new tools/toys on the phone like goggles, turn-by-turn directions, and buzz.<p>when those applications didn't show up in the android app market, i found out it was because i had android 1.5 running on my phone and all the cool stuff is for 2.0.  'no problem, i'll update,' says me.<p>about that.  you can download the latest three branded software from htc.  i borrowed a friends windows pc to do the update, since that's the only platform supported (ironic, since android unix based).  i allowed htc sync to erase my data (the only option) and update, only to find i'd updated to the version i already had.  version numbers are tricky; the phone's software have three different numbers and i had no idea which one referred to the android firmware.<p>'ok maybe i'll try a less conventional route.' lots of looking around helped me find out that although people used to be able to update these phones by rooting them, my phone's software had closed that door with a patch.  i'm not one to give up easily when it comes to winning with technology, but i only have so many days to live on this earth...<p>i have found a recent blog post suggesting that htc will provide an update for my phone (for a different carrier, but who knows?) in march.  oh well, i'm still enjoying the phone.  i guess the lord is teaching me patience.<p>as for the tricksy title of this post, i know that android is more open from a developer perspective, but on the iphone, everyone has access to os and application updates at once, which can be installed from two different platforms. 2010-02-19 10:50:07 UTC

9904518 ask hn: what's the mind hack? how do you keep your mind from wandering off while you are reading a rfc&#x2f;paper&#x2f;spec or are coding (easy there since i am building) or learning through video? how do you keep going even after an hour or two or more ? after a while (short) my mind tells me it&#x27;s enough &amp; it wanders off. what&#x27;s the hack here ? 2015-07-17 18:51:12 UTC
1685785 ask hn: to git or not to git hello world.
i'm at kind of a crossroads: i want to make a site that will feature a web based editor for text files in some markup languages aimed for non-developer users, but i want to offer them the ability to track changes to those files and maybe even "fork" and "merge" other documents/document-clusters; again, all via a web interface. basically, you could say that it's like a web-based github for non-devs.<p>i could use a key-value store like couchdb or cassandra to store diffs between times when something is saved to show histories and do merges with one of the strategies git uses; and <i></i><i>maybe</i><i></i> in the future let users use a desktop app and thus clone/push/pull changes like a regular git hosting site. again, in a skimmed non-dev approach to git.<p>for the record, this talk has practically convinced me of using git http://www.techscreencast.com/language/ruby/using-git-in-ruby-applications---scott-chacon-/1431 because i realize that it might seem overkill at first but i don't want to end up reinventing git. but a little n00b voice in my head still screams overkill.<p>so, hackerworld, what's your take on this? i mean, i could just do something with the [ruby](http://github.com/mojombo/grit)/(python)[http://gitorious.org/git-python] interfaces to git and something like gitosis, or create my own subset of file history management like said above; what would be the wisest choice? 2010-09-13 06:38:17 UTC

8239458 ask hn: need ip legal advice (i am using a throwaway for obvious reasons and pardon stilted english &amp; style ... ;)<p>i joined a high end tech a few months ago. this is a established startup. we have sv presence and elsewhere. at least on its way up if not already arrived. none of the big names but well known in its niche. smallish company in the low 3 digit head count range. the technical bench is solid and known stars here and there. not public. well financed, and pretty deep pockets.<p>when i joined, i was asked to sign a ip and confidentiality agreement, per norm. the agreement provided for my listing what i had done and been working on. this i did. a project that has been in the works for almost 5 years and is pretty novel in the general space was listed.<p>i never have been given back my counter signed copy and when i asked i was told it was being considered. (not exact words again for obvious reasons.) that was news to me as nothing was said verbally or in writing regarding that. i have reviewed the contract (and i am not a lawyer) and it says nothing about that. my recent email to an executive level about this has not been answered.<p>i have no idea what to make of this but as my work before joining and this company&#x27;s crown jewels are in the same  ballpark (distributed stuff) the idea that i should be talking to a lawyer keeps coming up in my head. this and bunch other things has kind of brought the decision to say my goodbyes to this company. i have started the process of making a transition.<p>i have written records and notebooks and some public comments (in social nets) and partial open source aspects of my work. i like to work to a state of completion before release so the entire project has never been out in the open.<p>i need advice. how to make the transition and also maybe leads to solid and aggressive lawyers in the valley who know how to deal with these matters. i am not rich, far from it. thank you. 2014-08-28 20:16:38 UTC

8869587 ask hn: is it ever worth working with recruiters? just having a scout around various job sites and 80% of jobs advertised are from recruiting companies (as you&#x27;d expect).<p>a lot of people&#x27;s personal websites that act or contain their cv&#x2f;resume will often state &#x27;no recruiters&#x27;. why is this?<p>i understand that with a lot of recruiters (even seemingly tech-oriented ones), there is a serious lack of understanding of the technology&#x2f;skills required for a lot of roles just by the way their job ads are written, is that the reason? that, alongside not being able to do your own due-diligence on whichever company they&#x27;re planning to hire you for?<p>obviously applying to companies directly is preferable, but it&#x27;s tricky to manually go out and find all suitable roles - and as i was saying, job sites are packed full of recruiters masking the company. obviously there is so careers, the monthly hn hiring threads, etc.<p>is it worth continuing the manual search or should i give in and work with some recruiters? 2015-01-11 10:13:00 UTC

2987536 ask hn: can i help you be more awesome today? (no strings. inquire within.) good morning!! about once every month, i ask the community if there's anything i can help them with. i do this becuase i like this community a lot and totally believe in the whole "pay it forward" mantra. crazy or not, i'm interested in helping you be a little more successful today. i've been calling these "no strings" sessions. (because there are no strings attached.) i've been doing this for a little while, so let me tell you a few things i've done to help others...<p>- i've given some really helpful advice for new-comers to the tech industry and those wanting to break into the field (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2544986)<p>- i'm a product of my own re-invention and like to show others how rewarding it can be (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2545255),<p>- i'm planning educational workshops for our community to learn (cram) on different technologies and how they can be quickly used for different benefits,<p>- i read approximately 600+ different articles, blog entries, and stories each month about what the tech world is doing. (i'm pretty informed!)<p>- i understand good design from bad design. aesthetics are not lost on me.<p>- i have a family (two kids) and juggle a hectic work-life balance (volunteering, full-time gig, building a startup, social life?) that's gradually improving.<p>if this sounds too good to be true, feel free to learn more about who i am and why i do these things at my blog: http://nobulb.com/personas/.<p>if there's something i can help you with, just ask here or @mikegreenberg on twitter. be specific about what you're trying to fix/solve/accomplish. the more details you provide, the better i can help you out. also, i should be able to do your request within 10-15 minutes (a soft time limit so i can spread the love a little quicker).<p>last time, the response was overwhelming and i was still answering questions days later (because i wanted to). if you want to get your question answered sooner (rather than later) your request should be thoughtful, sincere, researched and considerate of other people who might want help, too.<p>cheers!<p>ps: this is how it went last few times i did this:<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2877712<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2767448<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2649226<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2544886<p>pps: i'm not asking for anything in return, however, there is one way you could show your appreciation if you felt the need. i'm working on a project and currently doing some validation. if you would consider taking a short 2-minute survey, i would be quite appreciative.<p>survey: http://idjump.wufoo.com/forms/online-identity-and-you/ 2011-09-12 15:07:07 UTC

7322965 tox: next level of instant messaging the internet was made for communication. but talking with your friends, in a safe, reliable way, is much harder than it should be. secure, foss communication methods usually suffer from obscurity, and are typically still centralized, forcing the user to trust a server or to set up their own. we think it&#x27;s time that security and simplicity came together, available to everyone. tox is an encrypted, peer-to-peer network for instant messaging, calling, and videochatting, one-on-one or in groups. tox is a core protocol and api that anyone can make a client for. existing clients are listed on http:&#x2f;&#x2f;wiki.tox.im&#x2f;clients, including:<p>• a cross-platform gtk client (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;naxuroqa&#x2f;venom)<p>• a cross-platform qt client (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;nurupo&#x2f;projecttox-qt-gui)<p>• an os x client (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;stal888&#x2f;poison)<p>• an ios client (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;jman012&#x2f;toxicity)<p>• an android client (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;astonex&#x2f;antox)<p>• an ncurses-based terminal client for unix-likes ( https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;tox&#x2f;toxic )<p>the tox core has been shared all over the internet by inspired enthusiasts, and has drawn the attention of many developers. however, the clients haven&#x27;t received nearly the same amount of publicity, and their developers need help to bring easy, secure communication to the masses. and since the core is a simple protocol library with an api (and with bindings available for many other languages), you can start your own client too.
if you fancy yourself more of a low-level programmer, help with the core is always appreciated: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;irungentoo&#x2f;projecttox-core
developers are always present over at #tox-dev on freenode. for the api: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;api.libtoxcore.so&#x2f;<p>thank you for your time,<p>- https:&#x2f;&#x2f;tox.im&#x2f; 2014-03-01 03:18:45 UTC

(in fact, i'm procrastinating right now.) i spent most of my childhood doing what i was interested in (lego, then computers), which doesn't develop the skills needed for college.<p>i'm a computer science and mathematics double major, but i'm not sure if i'm clever enough for pure math; i am aceing the cs classes, though. i'm vaguely participating in a startup-like venture, but there is little pressure, and hence little actual startup atmosphere - but still good experience. i've thought many times about dropping out (of college), but i seriously don't have a plan, aside from the vague notion of "going to sf and figuring something out". besides, it seems like a good idea to get a college degree + the cs/math sophistication alongside it. nevertheless, i'm quite bored, by the vapid partying (which i refuse to take part in - decimating my social life), the happy-go-lucky attitude of most people, and lectures + homework in general.<p>my life goals? i want excitement (see adhd, above). maybe with computers. the current startup frenzy seems to fit like a glove, but i've only heard about it on the internet. 2008-06-23 00:10:36 UTC

8747550 ask hn: why people continue working in video game industry? its a common knowledge that being a video game developer for aaa titles means put up your soul to see it get done. browsing for big companies on glassdoor gives you a clear picture of what everyone goes through - twelve hours workdays, six days a week with no paid overtime, terrible management, and intense work pressure [1].<p>if i am not wrong developing 3d games is insanely hard thing to do, for variety of reasons. so why would anyone want to continue working in this industry when he can (hopefully) get better job opportunities by quitting?<p>[1]: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.glassdoor.com&#x2f;reviews&#x2f;rockstar-games-reviews-e20887.htm 2014-12-14 05:34:55 UTC

10061272 ask hn: how do you bookmark valuable hn posts? how do you bookmark valuable hn posts?<p>i used to use google reader and star the link.
now i&#x27;m using aol reader as i think it is the closest experience to google reader. but it lacks an android app. performing bookmarking needs to go through the mobile web version, which is bad.<p>i feel that hn should have a built-in bookmarking feature. what do you think? 2015-08-14 17:04:43 UTC
213000 ask yc: how do you start a social bookmarking site (like hn) w/o an audience? i've been experimenting with a site like hn, but quickly realized in order for stories to become popular you need a decent amount of people on the site participating.  without users, i seem to have 2 choices:  let everything appear on the home page, or show the very small amount of content that is voted on (or 3, make a bunch of dummy accounts and fake it).  thoughts? 2008-06-09 18:38:17 UTC
2639419 ask hn: what do start-ups look for in a ux researcher? hi,
i am a user experience researcher in the job hunt right now.
i am not a ux designer - which most start-ups demand. i don't code, i can get by with illustrator and photoshop stuff but i am definitely not an expert.<p>but here is what i can do really well - i observe, understand and analyze the things that the users care about and help designers build those things.
in brief, conducting usability tests, coming up with workflows, testing scenarios and have a major say in the design and look are some of the things i do best. and these are some of the things that most ux researchers do.<p>do start-ups look for someone with this expertise? or do they prefer someone who is a jack of all master of none? 2011-06-10 01:25:30 UTC

8219974 canadian startup looking for some guidancept 1 hello all...pt1<p>sorry, this is long winded question, so i split it up...theres a solution to everything...<p>we are a young canadian startup that is finding some early stage b2b traction..so far its very exciting for us, however, we are actually having to slow down our growth and have begun taking on a waiting list, simply due to lack of manpower.<p>our product is fairly disruptive in terms of whats currently out there, our go to market strategy is perhaps even more so as it solves most of the pain points and negates most of the barriers of entry for those we partner with. we have had to limit ourselves to 4 partners for our upcoming launch although there are other interested parties.<p>we are currently involved with a canadian ric in ottawa and have recently graduated from a unique incubator program known as grindspacexl. as many of you have most likely heard or know, the canadian mentality for funding is a little risk adverse. ok, lets face it, its extremely risk adverse.  its so bad, that the last term sheet we were offered was so bad and despite how much we could have used the money, we decided to turn it down. (some days i still wonder if that was the right move..our team and to extent me, believe it was..only time will tell i guess).<p>pt2 of canadian startup looking for some guidance follows this and is posted as well... 2014-08-24 23:19:33 UTC

3608474 ask hn: what percentage should an experienced technical co founder get? hi folks 
this is (obviously) a throwaway account.<p>i am in a situation where i am trying to evaluate the share of the pie that i should get as a technical co founder.<p>some background about me (without giving too much away:))
i am experienced, and successful in the corporate world and trying to make it in the startup world now (full time). i can do end to end development. although i am a backend developer - i can do a decent ui design/work as well (mainly thanx to bootstrap). so i would consider myself an ideal technical co founder by all accounts (i also consider myself a reasonable guy but that would be a biased opinion of course).<p>i have a business partner with whom i have worked previously on two ideas. suffice to say that we have not had an exit (though one of the ideas did land me some more shares of another private company who acquired our technology).<p>my partner is very reasonable by all accounts and i think he brings a lot of value. he is an innovative person who has a knack to come up with good ideas. he also is well connected and has been an executive on a big company before.<p>we started working on another idea where though he filed patents and all, i was not very convinced on the value of the idea itself. given that both of us bring a lot on the table, what is the right split? i understand that i may have missed some other info here - so feel free to ask and i would try and respond as clearly as i can. we have no issues between us (except i recently started thinking that i am not getting a fair share)<p>it may be too late to make a decision on this particular startup since we have agreed on a split (mainly because i did not have any other co founder options) but i want to get some unbiased point of view from hacker news folks to see if i am being unreasonable or not. 
my thinking is that we should split 50 50. because he has filed for patents (i am not convinced the value of patents in this case), i would say that i should at least get 40% of the pie.<p>what do you guys think?<p>thank you! 2012-02-19 02:41:11 UTC

2726392 ask hn: i'm looking for a self-managing bookmarking service hi, i'm currently using google chrome bookmarks which sync themselves over multiple machines. they are not ideal because they are too much work to maintain and search through properly.<p>i would like a browser integrated way of managing bookmarks, without having to worry about creating folders or meaningful names but still finding stuff with fuzzy search terms.
i continue to "lose" a lot of interesting bookmarks, and i have to delete a lot of the lesser ones because they would clutter my folders even more.<p>example: switching from a big game development project to a web project. my bookmark folder is now riddled with stuff that pertains only to game development. 
managing this mess, tidying up folder and sorting them is very inefficient and also error prone in search.<p>i do not want my bookmarks to be publicly shared, which seems to be the default for all the web based services out there. adding a bookmark has to be as simple as clicking a button in chrome, just like i do now. 
the bookmarks have to be cached locally, i absolutely do not want to wait a few seconds each time i open my bookmarks browser like i'd have to with google bookmarks. (: not the same as google chrome bookmarks!)<p>why am i asking?
just now, i was again looking for a css framework (something with "super simple fluid grid layout" or similar in the name). i know i saved it somewhere, but i can't find it anymore. it has classes like .threecol .fullpage 2011-07-04 12:53:09 UTC

2676463  ask hn: minecraft blueprint app with proven demand. interested in contributing? being done with university classes and in a transition period between academic pursuits and my career as an entrepreneur, i wanted to create a fun side project and the concept of a blueprint builder for minecraft came to mind (after working to build a complex structure in minecraft myself). the goal is to create an app that makes planning a minecraft structure easy—dare i say fun—and helpful by letting users know the amount of materials required and to provide instructions for creating the structure in-game.<p>i created a few mock ups showcasing how the app will function and posed a question gauging interest (links below) to the /r/minecraft community a few nights ago before heading to bed at 3:00am. i woke up and was expecting to find a handful of comments; maybe two or three. there were sixty. sixty comments before 8:30am! over the course of the day, it grew to 170+ comments, all positive saying they want this app—my favorite being, "shut up and take my money!!! really looking forward to this! will save me so much pain," which turned out to be a common sentiment.<p>reddit thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/minecraft/comments/i04lm/who_would_be_interested_in_using_this_blueprint/<p>mock up: http://i.imgur.com/gbiv6.png<p>mock up with key features shown/explained: http://i.imgur.com/klihn.png<p>so here i am on hn looking for a technical partner to help create a beautiful app that helps solve a major problem minecraft players have. you need to play minecraft yourself or be willing to get your hands dirty in-game and able to devote the time to release the app very quickly (with minimal features). this is meant to be a for-profit project, but more importantly it's for fun and as a means to showcase our talents!<p>please check out the reddit post first and send me an email (in my hn profile) if you want to contribute! i'll answer any questions you have in this thread as well. 2011-06-20 22:50:12 UTC

468937 guerrilla marketing: how twitter changed the way we will approach tradeshows i've been a long-time hn lurker, but we recently returned from a trade show experiment i thought i'd share with the rest of the small startups here: what happens when you drop the $20k booth, and pick up twitter as the main marketing tool instead?<p>as startups, we're often forced to be ultra-conservative about where we spend our money. last october my co-founder, rian gauvreau, and i launched clio, a web-based practice management tool designed specifically for solos and small firm lawyers. we've been building buzz about it using word-of-mouth marketing, but wanted to step things up at a tradeshow and try to get the word out in the mainstream legal press and blogs.<p>the legal industry's biggest tradeshow, legaltech new york, was the obvious place to do this - it just wrapped up yesterday. we wanted to attend the show and raise the visibility of clio, which traditionally would be done by buying a booth, flying out 2-3 people to staff it up, buying some giveaways, etc. renting the space for the booth alone would be $10k (just for a 10x10 booth), while buying a booth can easily be another $5-10k.<p>looking at a $20k+ tab to have a booth at this show, we decided we should look at an alternative: just showing up at the conference with a laptop for demos, setting up meetings beforehand with e-mail, and leveraging twitter to connect with existing and potential clients at the meeting (lawyers have a surprisingly vibrant presence on twitter - http://www.lextweet.com/).<p>the response? we spent 2 solid days answering dm's to set up meetings, even connected with giants in the field like bob ambrogi (@bobambrogi) via twitter. it was easily the most positive and exciting tradeshow experience i've had, and we didn't spend a penny on the traditional booth, shwag and rental expenses. for any other hn startups out there: think twice before shelling out for an expensive booth to get the message out: you might be surprised at how effective twitter can be as a marketing tool.<p>we blogged about this recently at http://www.goclio.com/blog/2009/02/05/ltny-wrap-up-how-twitter-changed-how-we-will-approach-tradeshows/. we're at http://twitter.com/goclio.<p>would be interesting in hearing other experiences/opinions around tradeshows. 2009-02-05 23:00:56 UTC

1202302 ask hn: is this a scalable idea? i'm just trying to continue a conversation i had with a colleague..<p>imagine putting together a team of designers and developers, engineers and an overall team of technical gurus. this team is pretty much capable of building anything in a decent amount of time. (for conversation sake, only web/mobile apps)<p>now imagine this team puts up a website asking the people of the world to submit ideas, or things they want built. a request for product, if we have to give it a name.<p>for example;
i'm frustrated with all the accounting software thats available to me. i want simple and easy way of tracking expenses.. and i want my app to process my taxes on a day-by-day basis. i don't want to build it. i don't care for that. i just have a need for such an app as a user.<p>i would goto this site and say this is my frustration and put the idea up for vote. if it hits a certain threshold in votes and interests, the team (company) takes over and dedicates labour and money to build the product.<p>when the product is built
a) it can be open-sourced and released for anyone to use<p>b) spin into a company of its own with for-profit focus<p>all the while you are achieving market fit through the feedback, free marketing, and a high-conversion on everything you build. only the most popular ideas get built minimizing the failure rate.<p>does this seam feasible?

438937 ask hn: choosing a industry/field how did you choose the industry or field that you specialize in? the biggest barrier i have found to starting a company ( or perhaps its another form of procrastination) is finding a field or industry that is sufficiently interesting to me, comparative to alternatives. i am curious as to how you (as an employee or entrepreneur etc) sat down and decided that from today on i am a online retailer, a web consultant, a md of a logistics company etc. did you just choose the field with the most interest to you, did you solve a problem that is personal to yourself, did you follow a methodology of finding a problem like steve blank suggests?? cheers, cameron 2009-01-18 02:52:48 UTC

7008763 ask hn: saas pricing features vs usage? given a saas with features that can be grouped by level: basic, intermediate, and enterprise and usage that can be throttled to light, medium, heavy (ie 1m, 5m, 10m req per month, peak?), what are some thoughts, considerations, or best practices?<p>for example, is it better to let all the users have all the features, but price by usage, since it seems that hardware resources are the largest monthly expenditure (ie hosting, storage, etc), or is it better to price by features, thus enticing users who want desirable feature x to upgrade? 2014-01-03 22:43:33 UTC

5380927 mailchimp charges you money as a penalty for stopping using their service this is just weird. i had a $50 monthly plan with mailchimp with 3500 subscribers and i wanted to stop sending emails (and stop paying for next month) until i can afford it and then jump back again.<p>i was surprised when i found out there wasn't a way to stop the monthly payment other than switching and paying for a different "pay as you go" plan. i haven't encountered this sort of practice in any other decent web service, ever. i contacted support and this was mailchimp's response:<p>http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=u1frh4bj<p>mirror: 
http://pastie.org/6514771<p>(tl;dr you just have to pay a penalty if you want to stop for a while or spend a whole day unsubscribing 1500+ users to get it to 2000 subscribers) 2013-03-15 15:01:06 UTC

2041428 state of django vs rails vs others i am familiar with both django and pylons and i am just wondering which framework should i use for my next project.<p>i am a big advocate for mongodb and frankly i am pretty tired of django's "django way". i do not want to use orm and i actually prefer other templating system like mako. i have coded on django extensively in the past. recently i read up on pylons - and i like it a lot. however, i find their lack of plugins to be a huge turn-off. as far as i know, the developers for pylons are moving to pyramids. flask from pocco looks nice but it's still immature as of right now.<p>on the other hand, i did a quick search on github and saw ror is immensely popular. i personally know ruby and hate the language quite strongly. however, there are also a lot of plugins for ror, and with other services tailored to ror (like heroku), it seems that ror is the de facto standard for web dev.<p>i am a technical founder and i want to use a framework which would be as easy as possible to deploy and scale. of course, the ability to find recruits on my campus for my team is also a huge factor why i want to pick a popular framework.<p>frankly, i want to stay in python but given the traction of ror i am debating whether i should give it a try.<p>please advise 2010-12-27 00:08:56 UTC

5349970 for hn: hacker's help network due to this year's unfortunate events and the increasing number of depressed hackers, me and a couple of friends decided to start a community not only for hn but for anyone seeking help.<p>i am very sad to hear the stories on hn like far_far_away's and others like him.not to mention the death of aaron swartz which definitely changed the mood for many hackers.i've been through this situation (depression) 5 years ago and it was a living hell.feeling trapped and no way out.<p>i want to help these people or at least try and i'm sure many of us want the same thing.this is not about money or business!it is about us.we are humans before anything else, and we have feelings.judging by the current trend we are not on the right path and some of us don't even know it yet.<p>so starting from today, i decided to dedicate some of my time specifically for this cause.i am sick of seeing people suffering here when i know i can do something about it.if i can improve someone's life by at least 5% i am happy.<p>if anyone is interested in joining this cause, i am open to any suggestion.this is not about me and you, it's about all of us.<p>for anyone interested the mail is this: hackershelp2013@gmail.com<p>i had no time to prepare something special but i believe this is the first step in the right direction.<p>more updates coming soon...<p>thank you all. 2013-03-09 23:15:35 UTC

5987533 ask hn: will go become a popular web development language? go is fast, but also somewhat more low-level than e.g. python and ruby. those of you who have tried out revel, web.go, etc., do you think that go has a big future in web development, or will it be a niche language? go gets a lot of attention here on hn, but so do other languages that have never gained a large following in the web sphere (e.g. erlang and haskell), and i&#x27;m curious as to whether things will be different with go. 2013-07-03 21:09:43 UTC

600281 tell hn: wolfram alpha preview goes live does what it says on the tin. accounts are private and there's no invites to hand out (sorry), but no ndas or restrictions on reporting.<p>first impression: useful, but there's a learning curve. if you want a specific datum, it's usually there and presented in a a variety of useful contexts. sometimes information is obviously there but it's not clear how to access it; for example, searching on 'citizen kane' will tell me it was directed by orson welles (along with other basic data), but searching on orson welles just gives the bare biographical data, not his filmography. it's not obvious how to dig that sort of information out.<p>the computational aspects are impressive and quite accessible thanks to good nlp; if you've already used mathematica you'll be familiar with a lot of them. i feel like there's a great deal of power that i haven't properly learned how to manipulate yet. i'm looking forward to the api, which (per this morning's webinar) wolfram says will be public and iirc, free.<p>paid services will include license of the alpha software for use on a company's internal datasets, as well as for commercial use of the data and 'large' computational tasks (whatever that means).<p>finally, it's open to the public on may 18th. 2009-05-08 21:38:16 UTC

1139185 i need to find out how to finish anything i start. help me. please. i am a horrible finisher.
i would consider myself reasonably smart (my iq scores have generally kept between 125 to 148), i am considered a creative asset at the workplace, but the one thing holding me back is my ability to finish a project.
and this is true of almost everything i undertake; i have a track record of unfinished projects that shame me into seeking help. my projects folder is full of projects i started but left incomplete and unfinished; at work i have not yet finished this project that should have been completed by now.
this character flaw is undermining all my strengths and i have to combat it at any cost. any advice would be appreciated. 2010-02-20 17:53:32 UTC

2050681 remind hn: we have a cognitive bias to "blame the victim" there is a cognitive bias i learned about in my sociology class that is especially relevant today with the popularity of the “sacked by an algorithm” post (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2049105).  it’s colloquially called “blaming the victim” and it’s the tendency we have, when seeing someone who got in a car accident, is being beaten by a policeman, is a abused by a spouse, etc., to think that they probably deserved or earned it.<p>when considering someone in a different position than us, we tend to imagine it’s because <i>they</i> are different more than we should; it’s more likely that we would behave similarly in a similar situation (than we would tend to believe).<p>related reading:<p>ddg search for "fundamental attribution error"

7617121 ask hn:  review my greeting card app. hello hn and happy easter,<p>does anyone need to send a last minute greeting card?<p>i am working on a greeting card app, https:&#x2f;&#x2f;happyfnny.com, and would say i&#x27;m at the point where i could use some feedback. this is still very much a work in progress but thought at this point i could do a soft launch for easter.<p>about happyfnny:<p>if your like me, aka single male, greeting cards and thank you notes are always high on the priority list but usually fall into the abyss of &#x27;things i forgot to do&#x27;.  if i do remember, i&#x27;m typically scrambling at the last second to purchase a card, buy a stamp and get to the post office. unfortunately, i don&#x27;t have a secretary or a girlfriend so ultimately this responsibility falls on me and i hoping to make it as easy, fun and functional as possible.<p>it&#x27;s also a multi-merchant marketplace, so if other designers are interested they can open a store profile and sell their cards within the app.  it&#x27;s web based, and cards are sent via text message or email. you can also add a photo and personal message to every card before it is sent.<p>i&#x27;m using braintree to process my payments and i just moved the app to rackspace.<p>this is a small part of a bigger product idea, and hopefully in the next week or so i&#x27;ll add a couple other features to make the cards more gift like in nature.  hopefully these features will help distinguish me from the other online greeting card apps already in existence.<p>thanks for your time.  any feedback is much appreciated.<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;happyfnny.com 2014-04-20 15:38:12 UTC

3536180 ask hn: how to get back to unix after a sales job? i am currently working in marketing /sales. i do have a bachelors in cs and how i got here is a whole different story. however, i do feel left out of the it race, for the lack of better words. so to sum up i had an it background wherein i had a month or so of unix admin mentoring/training. it was solaris mostly and i loved it. but i moved on to seek a challenging opportunity. that being said i still want to do some unix admin on the side. what would be a good resource or who will be willing to hire me for remote work or something of that sort ? please advise 2012-02-01 01:28:01 UTC
5151267 simply scale with nginx, memcached, php-fpm and apc when i started programming in php, my hosting setup involved a cpanel installation with apache and mysql. this has been the de facto standard for many php developers and for the most part i don’t think any of that needs to change. i simply never had to deal with websites that got more than 10,000 visits a day. this all changed when i started work at my current job a few years ago. we sell an educational product that serves a predictable 15,000 requests per minute for 10+ hours/day, every day. instead of apache, we use nginx with php-fpm to handle this traffic. this is becoming a very popular setup for many companies with non-trivial traffic, but i have also found success with it in my small 256mb ram vps. for various reasons, nginx does a better job with memory and concurrent connection handling than apache. in this post, i want to talk about some of the reasons you might want to go with this setup. 2013-02-01 15:36:13 UTC
8735474 ask hn: what's fair? hey
my company was acqui-hired while being pretty small, &lt;10 employees, all developers except for the ceo-founder. no one reached his&#x2f;hers 1-year cliff so we just got our un-vested options as rsus in the acquirer and with a new 4-year vesting plan . so basically now, after about a year of work, we got nothing out of the acquisition. legally i guess it&#x27;s ok since that is what our contract says. but my question is do you think it&#x27;s fair? 2014-12-11 16:05:04 UTC

7256938 ask hn: i compulsively over engineer everything. is professional help an option? i can&#x27;t finish personal projects because i compulsively over-engineer everything. with the simplest tasks, i always find myself going off on a grandiose architecture. this happens despite my complete self-awareness of the problem.<p>half seriously i wonder if i should go to a psychologist with this issue. it may be difficult to find one with enough of an understanding of software development though.<p>have any of you overcome this problem? how? 2014-02-18 07:52:38 UTC
1757300 anonymous cofounder so i have been internet friends with this guy for some years, now i want to do some stuff with him mainly for educational purposes but... imagine it actually turns out profitable. i can't think of a way to share profits and keep trust. i can imagine paying him via paypal but measuring how much he contributed would be hard. i am leading the project, have more experience etc.<p>at first i though i'd share all access to servers and all to maintain trust (i haven't actually done it yet) but our relationship is such that nothing stops him from taking over everything and locking me out of my own system :)<p>i think the best way to go on would be to stay solo, keep him as a freelancer and pay him based on some work he completes (paying only if what we build turns out to be profitable)<p>any thoughts? 2010-10-04 20:37:07 UTC
1598039 ask hn: landing pages ('coming soon' etc) that don't suck i've built out a page for a new project but until its ready to go i need something up for those who hit the domain.<p>i could do some basic minimal version of the page with 'coming soon' etc but i'd rather do something a little more fun and memorable.<p>do you know any examples of these pages thats stood out, or handled the whole notion in a good way? 2010-08-12 13:38:21 UTC
1920329 ask hn: a potential employer said he will get back to me, how long do i wait? i'm in this position at the moment.<p>i have contacted a potential employer, a cool little startup i would love to help out, by sending through a cover letter and my cv. the founder got back to me and said he was a little busy and would get back to me when he has a chance to read through my specs.<p>i'm now in the process of tossing up how long i wait before sending a polite reminder. it has been over a week now, is this too short a time to push him to get back to me? it's fine if he is busy and still hasn't gotten time to appraise me, but what do i say as a gentle reminder without seeming too pushy or needy? 2010-11-19 03:29:25 UTC

3979068 ask hn: most common motives to adopt difficult technology and would you do that? = background:<p>i have an idea to bring semantic web [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semantic_web] &#38; linked data [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linked_data] into mainstream by creating a platform/marketplace for consumer (from ordinary users to small-medium businesses and beyond) applications. technology proof-of-concept that this is possible to do is mostly ready.<p>however, one of the corner stones of such product would be technology adoption by developers, which is not very mainstream or well known. couple of buzzwords: rdf [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resource_description_framework] or turtle [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turtle_(syntax)], sparql [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sparql], xml &#38; xslt. below all this would be code in java or php, probably other languages as well.<p>my main traction point for app-authors would be a continuous revenue stream (read - customer subscriptions) for them. which, in theory, should create quite a big income for app-authors, given that they adopt technology early and their application(s) are well made &#38; customers continuously like them. as a platform vendor i would try to lead app-authors through this endeavor in new technology.<p>= question:<p>is money big enough incentive to try new technology on a new platform/marketplace? what would motivate you more/less to try it out?<p>p.s. i would like to start a healthy discussion about this (or the topic in general) instead of providing fixed set of answers. thank you! 2012-05-15 21:47:52 UTC

9566978 ask hn: how “technical” is a technical solutions engineer position at google? i&#x27;ve been rejected for an sre position after the on-site step because of one particular interview. the others did succeed according to my recruiter, who offered to contact me again in one year for applying for the same position (i guess this is how these things work); i replied: &quot;yes, why not?&quot;, i&#x27;ve no rush at the moment.<p>after some weeks another recruiter reached me by email saying that he received my resume from the recruiting team, and asking if i could be interested in applying for a technical solutions engineer position ([1] or [2]). i&#x27;m sure he could provide me all the information i need, but i was also looking for an impartial and external point of view, so i&#x27;m asking here.<p>my doubt is that this role may be too distant from a generic system&#x2f;software engineer position and not particularly inline with my academic degree: a msc in computer science. i&#x27;m maybe wrong but, reading the information reported in the links, it seems to me that ultimately it boils down to a customers support job (especially [1]) and that it may give little to no advantage to one who plans to eventually switch to a different engineering position; i don&#x27;t know... i&#x27;m perceiving this as a &quot;backup offer&quot;.<p>in your opinion, is it worth to take this chance even if i&#x27;m interested in other engineering positions? is my view about this somewhat biased by the rejection?<p>thank you so much for your time.<p>[1]: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.google.com&#x2f;about&#x2f;careers&#x2f;search#!t=jo&amp;jid=107445001&amp;

8875596 open source project - restaurant order management app i&#x27;d like help to make my project open source. it&#x27;s called orderupp and its a restaurant ordering system for restaurants. you can see the promo site at orderupp.com. it&#x27;s written in angular and bootstap with a firebase backend. i have it running in a restaurant and can no longer maintain it. right now i have it in private repository on github. i would like open it up and try to build a community around the software, but i dont really know where to start. it is functional now at basic functions, but needs to abstracted out and feature set needs additions. the idea is that any startup restaurant&#x2f;foodtruck would have a free, comprehensive technology solution to run their business.<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;orderupp.com<p>demo at:

7515856 nosql master master write performance we are rewriting an application which is write heavy (wont go into exact numbers but +00&#x27;s of writes per second currently).<p>the original application was using a postgresql back-end (now severely struggling) but we are wanting to move to nosql due to changing schemas etc.<p>to give an idea of our setup.<p>we have two application server sets. one in the uk the other in the us, but only one database which is in the uk.<p>we want to have a setup where by as the company expands we can create more application server sets in different locations each with an application server and datastore.<p>because write speed is more important than read we need a solution which will offer us the ability to add extra datastore nodes in order to increase write performance with the data being replicated across other locations.<p>i would like to know what people suggest as a nosql datastore which will offer us the ability to have master:x:master replication and a high write rate. 2014-04-02 14:44:50 UTC

1074751 do early applications actually get an advantage? i've read paul graham's post about how they would like applications to be sent in earlier, and how they would begin reviewing apps earlier and "interacting" with applicants. and thus, those who send in their apps early get an "advantage".<p>but is this actually true? i mean, theres no real incentive, only a promise that by making their lives easier, we increase our chances somehow.<p>i know in psychology, the lastest impressions are the strongest. if your a strong applicant and you apply 2 weeks before the deadline, your impression  diminishes as other stronger applications come in. whereas if you apply last minute with a large lump of applicants, you don't necessarily lose impact, your just one of the bunch. some would argue that by applying early, you're on their mind longer and get some sort of benefit that way. but i'm not sure thats true.<p>i think an interesting study would be to look at applicants submission dates, and compare those who got interviews / accepted against one another. my hypothesis is that a majority of those that made it in had last second submissions. might provide for some interesting economics.<p>(on that note, anyone ever read freakonomics?) 2010-01-25 09:26:03 UTC

transfer value to a second social networking user, even if
the second user is not registered with the money transfer
service from which the first user initiates the transfer...<p>our service:<p>pikapay.com

2481064 ask hn: explorations of freedom of speech i've asked this question in a few places, but haven't really managed to get a great deal of content to match. i'm hoping hn will forgive a slightly non-technical related question given the context and content.<p>i'm looking for resources on explorations of the philosophy of 'freedom of speech'. it seems to nowadays have a lot of baggage about it - such as the fact that people seem to mistake the platform for the speech itself or that the entire concept of freedom of speech fails to take into account that some people have a much, much louder 'voice' in today's media.<p>i'm not looking for arguments against freedom of speech but rather for resources that explore these ideas and maybe refine the general premise of 'freedom of speech' and explore the nuances of what it means compared to 'equality of speech' or 'power of speech' or other concepts.<p>this is the ask mefi thread: http://ask.metafilter.com/183216/explorations-of-freedom-of-speech<p>this is the reddit thread:

4145283 how does hn banning work?  my submitted posts never appear hey hn!<p>so, i made a login for hn a few weeks back.  i submitted two posts originally (ask hn posts) and got a few responses on each one.  after that, none of my posts received any attention at all (granted, they could  just have been very boring).  but i recently submitted a post, then logged out and checked the new section on hn.  my submitted post was not visible!  it wasn't on the new section at all.  when i viewed my profile (whilst not being logged in), i had nothing under the "submitted posts" section of my profile.<p>how and why was i banned?  i only had about 5 posts overall, and all were questions (no spamming of any kind).<p>ps- this is a new account 2012-06-22 03:47:48 UTC

365524 ask hn: virtual gifts vs real-world prizes? i am currently working on a project that features a social network in which people can earn points for different actions around the site.  just like most forums or social networks, rank increases with the total points a user earns.  i've been considering taking this system to the next level in order to give added incentive for participating in the site.  there are a few options but the two that seem to stick out to me are:<p>1. virtual gifts - user able to 'buy' digital gifts using points earned.<p>2. real-world prizes - user able to claim real-world prizes using the points they have amassed, which are then shipped to the user.  these prizes would obviously be much harder to obtain than virtual gifts.<p>i have seen many examples of sites using the first model, however the second seems to be a bit harder to find.<p>has anyone else considered these options for their project before?  any insight would be useful. 2008-11-15 20:50:55 UTC

5921107 ask hn: will be hard to get a job without a degree in the future? i used to study maths at college, but i always code -as a freelance and also in a startups-. now i changed to computer sciences, but still i am not comfortable. i think college is not for me - after five years, i did little progress.<p>i am not happy with it anymore - it makes me sad : i work from 9 to 6 and then go to college until 11pm, monday to friday. i see my gf only on weekends and i almost dont see my friends anymore.<p>if i kept going on this is because people kept saying this is the correct for my future, but i don&#x27;t think i can still do it anymore.<p>what&#x27;s your opinion or experience? until now, i never had trouble finding a job, but do you think in the future will be really hard to get a job without a degree?<p>thank you! 2013-06-21 21:23:05 UTC
8369828 ask hn: mvp vs. landing page i have lately noticed that a lot of people confuse or claim their landing page as mvp. there are websites like quickmvp that just make a landing page but call it mvp. 
 i am curious if that is the case. doesn&#x27;t mvp refer to a hacked prototype which might not look good but does everything that the real product would do? while landing page is just single page webapp to market your idea?
please share your thoughts on this. 2014-09-25 21:28:45 UTC
6664327 ask hn: where should one go to discuss the higher topics of cs/programming? i know there are a lot of obvious answers to this question but so far i don’t like any of them.<p>the biggest seems to be stack exchange: don’t like that because it’s totalitarian and only handles precise questions with specific answers.<p>next is irc which is great except you’ve got everybody in one big room all talking over each other and it keeps interrupting you because it is realtime and not offline.<p>mailing lists seem to be full of good programmers but i don’t really like the way everything is delivered to you to be stored locally and there’s no distinction between conversations you are involved in and the rest. on a busy mailing list that is a big problem. this seems to just be an interface problem so maybe there is a good client for mailing lists out there?<p>then there’s newsgroups. my isp doesn’t provide newsgroup servers any more so i have to pay to access these now. and aren’t they all full of spam?<p>lastly you have normal forums which are my favorite in terms of their interface but seem to be full of novices now. is there a web forum for programmers who want to discuss design, methodology, programming language design, computer science, etc.? or has that era of the internet ended now? 2013-11-03 18:21:36 UTC

4572810 ask hn: would you pay for this? who would pay for an app that allowed you to track the receipt of email?<p>i'm currently doing some initial market research for a b2b i'm interested in starting. it's in a domain i'm not super familiar with, so i'm reaching out to potential clients to determine what issues problems they have. i plan to email no less than 100 businesses to hopefully lead to maybe 15-20 good quality phone conversations with my potential clients.<p>the problem is that i have no idea how well i'm doing. i keep a spread sheet of those i've emailed and i'd really like to know when a lead is dead. for example, if i knew a person opened the email three days ago and still hasn't replied, i would feel good about changing their status on my list.<p>i know some solutions exist, but they're terrible. i've considered making something that would work with a single click while using my gmail web client but i really don't want to if something great is already out there or if i can't get something back from my effort.<p>so i ask: who here would pay for this? i would. and actually, i'm willing to pay right now if someone has something good. 2012-09-25 21:37:05 UTC

2073832 ask hn: if you have adhd, what are your strategies to deal with it? i am a developer at a small company.  i suffer from adhd and it has started to take its toll.  the trouble is unless the problem is interesting, i am unable to maintain focus for more than 20 mins.  subsequently, i spend a lot of time in hn,slashdot, reddit etc.  i have managed to meet deadlines(by pulling all nighters before the deadline) but i know i could have done a better job had i started earlier.  the other side effect of procrastination and inattention is my family life suffers.  i am constantly anxious about work not done at home and my wife hates it. drugs(ritalin etc) do not work for me as i do not tolerate the side effects well(cannot sleep at all). while i am going to give drugs another try,  i was wondering if there were others developers who had add and what their strategies were to deal with the situation. 2011-01-06 03:43:06 UTC

9753366 ask hn: is c/c++ really faster than python? i have seen many people saying they choose c&#x2f;c++ over python during programming challenges because the performance of python is lesser compared to c&#x2f;c++. how correct is this fact?<p>if python is actually slower compared to c&#x2f;c++, how much slower is it when we implement the same algorithm in c&#x2f;c++?<p>is it really necessary to use only c&#x2f;c++ and not python when solving some questions which involve a lot of computation? 2015-06-21 13:36:01 UTC

1112808 does my company really own every idea i come up with? i am a long-time lurker here on hn, and have never submitted a story before, but i really need your opinions/advice.<p>i work for a large company that owns a website with a couple million members that allows them to get answers to their technical questions, read blogs, network with their peers, etc from that website. i am a salaried mid-level .net developer at work during the day.<p>i came up with an idea for a web app that could really take off. i've been working on it at home, on my own machine, on my own time. its written in python using the google app engine sdk (super awesome, btw). i can see needing angel or vc funding at some point, or selling it if it really does take off (that would be my ultimate 
goal, of course -- selling it to a larger company and cashing out).<p>my concern is, since i work for this larger company and signed an "employer protection agreement" when i was hired, do they own my "invention" (web app), even though it was developed on my own time, with my own resources? where is the line between whether a web app relates to my current employer's site or not. without going into too many details at this point, it would essentially be an aggregator of my user's personal contacts.<p>the exact wording in the agreement i signed says:<p>"the company will own (a) any inventions, trade secrets, ideas, original works of authorship or confidential information that employee conceives, develops, discovers or makes in whole or in part during employee's employment by the company that relate to the company's business or the company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development"...<p>that part i <i>think</i> is fine, because my idea does not really directly relate to their website. what worries me is this blanket catch-all statement at the end:<p>"...to the extent any of the foregoing is not deemed to be a work made for hire, employee hereby irrevocably assigns all copyrights, patent rights, and other ownership to the company...and employee will not at any time contest the validity of such rights".<p>does that mean they own anything i invent that relates to any subject matter? do i need to quit my job just to be able to work on this idea? i have three kids and a wife at home and work full time just to make ends meet. i work on my ideas for as long as i can at night, until i'm about to collapse. i'm making progress, but is it worth it? 2010-02-09 18:21:26 UTC

131359 ask yc: why do you recommend a macbook? i started my programming love life with apple //c. after that, i've mostly used relatively inexpensive laptops running linux / school pcs.<p>but i am seeing almost all 'budding hackers' nowadays coding on a macbook/pro. startup school is full of macs!<p>pg said that mac lets him drag and drop code from vim to repl - and he was very happy about it. is it little things like that or is there a cumulative reduction in friction everywhere that justifies the bigger price tag? is customizing a mac easy or do they throw arbitrary hurdles at you like with the ipod/iphone?<p>i currently run gutsy on lenovo t61 for dev. i don't want to miss out on the mac if there are significant advantages. 2008-03-07 18:22:44 UTC

8973023 ask hn: i got let go this morning. what should i do next? i went in to work this morning, in downtown cleveland, ordered a blt for our free lunch friday, and got called into a meeting. i was told my position was being removed (probably to cut costs, although they did not say), and i needed to clean off my desk. i&#x27;m a javascript developer. i built a large angular application while there, but it is now built and there are other developers who can support it.<p>as far as i see it, i have this great opportunity to break out of the regular 9-5 job world, which i have always wanted to do. i have been working weekends on pearmarket.co, which is a website for small farmers to more easily promote their products online (i have recently open sourced the core of the project at https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;thecolorblue&#x2f;beetpress). unfortunately, it is not currently in a place where i can dedicate all of my time to it and see any income. i would say i am 3 months of solid work away from having a good beta. i do not see this as an option as it would clear out most of my savings, and leave me in mostly the same position i am in now.<p>i have looked into doing freelance work, but as i am self taught my cs skills are not as solid as other developers, and my design skills are just about average. i am more product focused, i try to work as closely to the end user as possible and clearly define what they need. there does not seem to be a need for freelance product people (is this a good assumption?). it&#x27;s also important to note that i am 28 and just got engaged. moving is an option, but living on a spare couch for a couple months is not.<p>so i really have two questions. what would you do in my situation (would you stay in a smaller city?), and if you could start over in web development, what would you focus on? 2015-01-30 17:17:47 UTC

6405950 are spammers going to kill us toll-free phone service? i&#x27;ve noticed a huge surge in these silent calls to my toll-free number in the us, some spammer&#x27;s way of making money from the dial around compensation fee (which appears to be unique to the us). at the current rate, it will cost me around $1200 extra per year, and i&#x27;m dropping my toll-free line as fast as i can (in about a year to switch my customer base and potential sales leads) before this scam becomes more widespread and the frequency increases even more. will this mark the end of toll-free service, or does anyone have a way to identify and stop the dial around compensation fee from ever getting collected?<p>the spammers are using an enormous phone bank of hundreds of phone numbers, so there is no way i can black list them before they rotate numbers and effectively make an infinite list of numbers. my toll-free line is how new customers call me, so i can&#x27;t white list callers. simply making a connection for a few seconds inserts the dial around compensation fee to my monthly bill, so it is ineffective to just hang up. the toll-free service provider and the phone company are uninterested in helping me solve this problem.<p>this seems a pretty effective way to practically kill toll-free service in the us, for all but the most major customers of toll-free lines that can absorb this kind of scam as the cost of doing business. i can afford $1200 over a year, but the way dial around compensation is set up, there is nearly no limit to the abuse that can be dished out; it can conceivably increase an order of magnitude and i would still be paying the fees. 2013-09-18 15:47:38 UTC

2400454 ask hn: does anyone here get into 'the zone' with tv shows / movies? for years now i find that the best way to focus is putting on (a bunch of) tv shows or some movie in the background while i'm programming. i tried a lot and this does make me more productive. they need to be not very entertaining, but not real bad either. like cheesy horror or thriller movies seem to work very well. does anyone have this as well and why do you think this makes 'us' more focused than the typical music and no background noises you so often hear?<p>note: i actually only remember of the series or movie that i either liked or not liked it, i cannot even tell you what it was about. if i liked it, i'll watch it a second time (either while programming or 'for real') and i notice usually that after 30 minutes i do remember everything even though i didn't watch it consciously. 2011-04-02 17:42:19 UTC

2474755 tell hn: bump for android seems to read gps constantly in standby mode today i saw something strange on my htc desire: every time i resumed from standby, the gps indicator was on. i haven't seen this before, so i figured it was a new app or an update. i went through the apps i had most recently updated, uninstalled each one and checked if the gps indicator would disappear. after uninstalling bump, it no longer used the gps.<p>the bump page on android market has several reviews stating the same thing:
https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bumptech.bumpga&#38;hl=en<p>after the recent iphone "locationgate", i thought it would be of some interest. 2011-04-22 17:35:00 UTC

6383004 ask hn: should i tell my previous employer the new hire is no good? obviously i&#x27;m posting this from a throw away account.<p>ok, some months ago i&#x27;ve quit my job to move on to better opportunities. since i was the only dev i agreed to be available to help the new hire out if he needed any help. so i still have access to all the servers and such.<p>anyway, today curiosity won me over and i took a peek at what the code he produced looked like. and i was shocked. it is a mess of sphagetti code, one file that contains everything from php, html, css and js, html that contains inline css etc. i should mention that the whole system is otherwise built on a mvc framework and all the code that i wrote before i left kept things where they should be.<p>so now i feel like i should say something to my previous boss. maybe i feel that way because i was the one who did the technical interview with the new hire, and although he wasn&#x27;t amazing i got the impression that he is at least a solid developer. and time was running out so my boss decided to hire him. but i never expected the new hire to produce such rubbish code. i just feel that if things won&#x27;t change my ex-bosses business will go down the toilet as this new hire will end up producing a unmaintainable mess that nobody else will want to touch ... 2013-09-13 20:41:21 UTC

8364626 ask hn: how do i move from a cushy corporate job to a startup? hi hn!<p>i&#x27;m a couple years out of college but have only worked for large tech companies. my long term ambition is to build a startup of my own someday (yes, i&#x27;m following along with how to start a startup). leaving my cushy corporate job and joining a startup seems like the next logical step in that journey.<p>my biggest enemy has always been my confidence. i always have that little voice in my head telling me i&#x27;m not smart enough to succeed at it, or that i&#x27;ll burn out quickly, etc. maybe it&#x27;s all just part of that hn effect where i compare myself to the front page subconsciously. i don&#x27;t know.<p>any tips or pieces of advice on proceeding? i&#x27;m going to be updating my resume and personal site in the next day or so before i begin applying, but i&#x27;m feeling super nervous about it so i wanted to hear more from the people who have done it and what there experience was like.<p>thanks for any constructive advice and commentary you may have. it&#x27;s greatly appreciated. 2014-09-24 22:55:32 UTC
3374193 would you pay for a google enterprise-esque service hosted in scandinavia? forgive me as i post this from a throwaway account, but i have been a member here for a few years:<p>given the recent rash of privacy-related concerns and the increasingly-concerning intrusive behavior of the us government in the affairs of its businesses and their customers, i have seen a growing trend of many us-based companies looking to host customers' sensitive data and private information out of the united states to avoid being forced to compromise the privacy and integrity of their users.<p>i am a "serial entrepreneur" with a successful track record that is seriously considering launching a "google enterprise"-like service hosted in one of the scandinavian nations, with the twist of focusing first and foremost on the privacy of the client.<p>the core services would initially be similar to the basic hosted enterprise features (email/webmail, contacts, documents, calendar, etc.) potentially expanding into aws-like territory, structured in a way where we would be able to guarantee the privacy and integrity of any information hosted with us. there would be a very strong focus on encryption and security in general.<p>while i do believe that this is a lucrative business opportunity, this would be a very big step for me as i do not live in scandinavia; but i genuinely feel that this is a concern that needs to be addressed sooner rather than later as i have seen a shocking number of posts here on hn detailing cases where startups and businesses have been unable to offer or continue offering particular services given the current political weather in the usa.<p>basically, if such a service were to exist would you as a business pay for such a hosted solution? and as an individual (a la gmail)? 2011-12-20 17:14:02 UTC

10371092 ask hn: how should i develop my cms / back end? i&#x27;ve been working on a backend in php for the past year, expanding and changing it every time a customer needed new things that were not previously covered by it. i was using laravel because not only i felt comfortable with pbp but also i really liked how easy it was to implement new functionality.<p>now the time has come where i have to step up a notch, change the backend design and extend it a lot further to support an incoming wave of new clients that expect something more than what i&#x27;m currently offering.<p>i&#x27;ve been digging hn a lot and reading about everything that could help me here and i opted for using go for the backend. the idea would be to write all the functionality on go, users, db and such and write the frontend with angularjs connecting it through a rest-like api. i don&#x27;t have right now the time to learn go and rewrite everything i made on php, but i plan on doing it in the next 6 months.<p>right now i&#x27;ll be writing the backend again in laravel i think, but only the functionality. my idea is to make an api and have the frontend with angularjs connect to it using post&#x2f;get to do everything. this way i can isolate the backend from the frontend and eventually rewrite the backend in go without needing to touch the frontend in angular.<p>does this make any sense? is this, a good way to approach this although its maybe not the best one? what are your thoughts? thank you! 2015-10-11 21:16:05 UTC

2875604 ask hn: google+ layers (in addition to circles) it has recently been announced that g+ has added games to its platform. games, invariably, that one would play solo or with people from your various circles.<p>while i am sure this is a natural progression of adding a feature to g+, i, personally, will likely never use it. i just don't play online games - and i don't spend too much time on g+ yet (i have never had a facebook account - though i now have a g+ account and use it to upload pics -- i don't follow anyone's streams, so, please take the following thought with that in mind).<p>i am far more interested in a suite of productivity tools being added to g+ than i am games. i call this functionality "layers"<p>with layers (l+) one would be able to create an ad-hoc group from one's circles who would have a shared layer of information on which they collaborate and work together.<p>these layers would allow for a virtual team to have a shared space, each layer having a context, which would effectually be a project. tools available to the team on the same layer would be google docs features, storage, a mail viewport (the mail pane on this layer would be auto-tagged to the layer's context and would be the only mail you see in this tab, even though it is using your regular gmail account), calendar viewport (same as mail - but you would still see other calendar items on the schedule, jsut say, in black and white as opposed to the color - making it easy to discern evens related to that layer), a project feed - grouping all posts based on that context (think yammer), shared layer contact list, etc..<p>the idea is, i am not really interested in playing games - but i am interested in having a powerful tool for organizing people from my circles around specific things i want to accomplish.<p>l+ modules and addons would allow for a project page, github connections, project domain + email address --&#62; helpdesk/issue tracking capabilities.<p>the ------ = the silo'd features available that i listed out.. the layers would just be a view applied to each feature.<p>l2 ------- : project specific view for project 2<p>l1 ------- : project specific view for project 1<p>g+ ------- : typical g+ experience<p>allowing layers will greatly increase the opportunity that g+ can change the online experience as opposed to being "simply a better facebook"<p>there is a great deal more in my thinking on this - but i thought i would throw the base idea out there for some feedback.<p>what say you, hn, do you feel this would be a good direction for g+ to go - rather than simply enabling the more distractionary aspects of a social network i.e. games.<p>layers could be used to more formally organize political campaings, non-profit efforts, volunteers, virtual teams in startups, activism, etc... 2011-08-12 01:38:37 UTC

2792902 12 reasons why every linux system administrator should be lazy   2011-07-22 09:46:41 UTC
4440894 i'm trying to make it easy for people to generate linux live and install images. this is something i've wanted to do for a long time, and i'd really like to be devoting my time to getting it up and running. it's the future, a well-done service like this is something i really think should exist. it would definitely be a benefit to myself, and to a lot of linux users i know, let alone general computer users.<p>please check out the indiegogo campaign at http://igg.me/p/212585?a=1092744 -- any feedback would be greatly appreciated! 2012-08-27 21:00:05 UTC

2739021 ask hn: is it a mistake to base my company on the msft stack? i have been building two prototype versions of my software, one in c# (which i know like the back of my hand) and one in scala (which i'm learning).<p>after spending time talking to a lot of developers, i'm concerned about continuing to use the microsoft stack, even though i know it the best.<p>my concerns are:<p>1. hiring. will it be a problem to find excellent c# developers that are interested in working at a startup? so far i've found that the really great developers make huge salaries at fortune 500 type companies and don't seem very risk tolerant. i think they're great engineers, but they seem way more interested in fishing than doing a startup.<p>2. acquisitions: pretending for a moment that i have a modicum of success, does choice of platform have an impact on the interest of an acquiring company? will i be shooting myself in the foot by going the closed-source route?<p>i know that hn is mostly anti-microsoft, but i think that people here are also pragmatic. is it worth spending the time working with a technology that might not be known as well (although it seems to work well-enough so far) in order to mitigate the risks in hiring and acquisition later (if they are actually risks)? 2011-07-07 16:06:30 UTC

1157620 ask hn: does an index fund count as diversifying? so, i'm average joe programmer.  i contribute to 401k, and i have a high yield savings account for very short term stuff.  i would like to start investing in something that will be usable in the short-medium term.<p>i don't know much at all about the stock market, and don't want to learn.  i am thinking about putting some fixed amount of money per month in a single index fund (a large, broad index fund).<p>is this enough in terms of diversification, given my other investments?  goal is to either:<p>1. be able to take the money out in short-medium term (3-6 years maybe) as a down payment for a house
2. go "all the way" and provide funding for an early retirement.<p>is contributing $100ish per month through a standard online broker (scottrade, etrade, sharebuilder, whatever), to a single index fund a smart choice for somebody like me?<p>some base stats:
age: 26
immediate liquid capital: low 5-figures, enough for 6 months of living, in a random high-yield savings.
401k contributions: ~10k/year<p>the obvious "put more in 401k" i don't think applies to me.  i am already contributing a pretty substantial amount, and i would like to potentially have access to the money much sooner than a 401k would allow.  picking a single index-fund seems to make sense for me, since i'm going to be doing repeated small contributions, and thus will save on brokerage costs.<p>aaaaaaaand i'm rambling.  any advice would be appreciated. 2010-02-28 22:54:49 UTC

2377893 how i got funded by future customers when i started looking for money for my project, i had no idea how to find funders.
i don't live in the us, i'm from italy and spend too much living in different countries to be able to build the right relationships with funders.
so i decided to ask future potential customers.<p>the system i am building allows people to create their own online business.
in italy i am known as "the guy who lives traveling" and everybody asks me all the time how i do it (i have a small online business...not a very big deal) and i kind of "sold the dream":
in short i said "i have been working online and traveling for 10 years.
now i am going to build a platform so that also you can do this. i need money, would you pay in advance 1000 euro to be part of it?".
it worked and i collected 25.000..not much but enough to start. 
if they decide to leave i have to give the money back (not immediately), while if they stay i made the sale before even writing a single line of code.
there's really a lot to say (it's going quite well), it deserves a few blog posts.
the best thing is not only that i got the money to go ahead but the community we built together.
amazing people, with a common dream: work online and quit the day job to travel or simply have more control on one's life.
nobody wants to be a millionaire.<p>i just wanted to share this with you as some may be interested about it.
feel free to ask any questions of course and thank you for hn, it's my first read in the morning!

what are your questions?
what are your concerns? 
are there any cryptocoins besides btc that are of any interest?<p>we are very close to launching our beta. we&#x27;re looking for some companies who would like to participate in our beta. you can sign up here for beta access or just to be alerted when we launch (very soon.) we&#x27;ll open it up quickly though after that. you can sign up here: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.incoin.io&#x2f; 2014-06-19 14:48:53 UTC

1054819 ask pg: what have i done wrong? tl;dr: now my votes are broken, and i'm sad. (edited: "dl;dr" -&#62; "tl;dr" - sorry.)<p>================<p>i've seen this complaint made several times before, with people finding that their votes are apparently not having any effect.  i've watched the discussions, not feeling i have anything to contribute, wondering what they may have done to trigger the secretive "vote-ignoring" logic that you tinker with.<p>i understand that you need to stay on top of the problem of people gaming the system, and that being too open just makes it easier for people to screw around and make the voting system less valuable.<p>but generally i rely on high-quality items bubbling to the top, so when i see a comment i think is valuable and yet which is low down in the pecking order, i upvote it.  i take care, i try to add value, i invest time.<p>and now i've found that some of my recent votes haven't made a difference. the comments i thought were worth boosting continue to languish.  the people i thought were worth rewarding haven't got the karma.<p>i've wasted my time trying to make the site more valuable.<p>so, while i'll continue to believe that things are partially random, but biased to having better stuff near the top, i'm no longer as confident as i was.  i'll continue to scan the new submissions to see if there's anything interesting, and maybe i'll click on an up arrow, but i'm pretty disincentivized about bothering to spend time trying to add value.<p>the message is that my time isn't valued.  you've encouraged me into taking without giving back.  you've encouraged me to react without thinking.<p>if that's the message you intended, i think that's sad.<p>here are two links to earlier discussions - there are more.<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=871202<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=233460 2010-01-15 13:31:21 UTC

2075049 dear google: please let me ban sites from results given the current high-ranking thread about spammy sites in google results, it strikes me that a very simple solution would be to let logged-in users blacklist sites.<p>bam, no more wareseeker or efreedom.<p>this would solve a lot of people's complaints in one fell swoop.<p>there are greasemonkey etc. scripts to do this, but they're tied to a single browser on a single machine. a global filter (like in gmail) would be so much more useful.<p>would this be particularly hard to do? 2011-01-06 12:47:02 UTC
2697657 i spent a coin (and i liked it) — how i bought lunch in manhattan with bitcoins some people claim that bitcoin isn’t a “real currency,” that it is “imaginary,” or a ponzi scheme — for a number of reasons, but perhaps mostly because there’s no obvious way to use them in most people’s daily lives. i have a different perspective because last week i paid for lunch with bitcoins. here’s how it happened. 2011-06-26 08:06:54 UTC

208689 ask yc: recommend a white label comment system? my company has been looking for a good commenting system for general use across multiple parts of our site. we have been using groupee for our forums for several years but until recently they have not offered a commenting system, though one is in development. it hasn't been released yet, so we want to explore alternatives along with theirs.<p>we have been trying out jive for a new forum alternative since the beginning of the year, and while overall the forum system is excellent, its comment widget functionality is lacking. we have spent dozens of man hours trying to customize it to work with our existing member registration system but its been like putting lipstick on a pig.<p>i have talked to the founders of disqus and their system can't integrate with our system to the degree we need.<p>i've looked at intensedebate.com tonight and while i am impressed with some of the functionality, they are way too beta for my bosses to be comfortable with. i saw huge bugs with their system within 10 minutes of trying it out.<p>are there any alternative commenting systems? we are more than prepared to host internally (we're already setup for jive) or to use a third party system if it has good integration options?<p>for integration points:
1) needs to integrate with our registration/user system.
2) allow us to use our member profile images for avatars.
3) advanced options that are wanted but not mandatory: threaded comments, pagination, basic wysiwyg text editing.<p>thanks hn! 2008-06-04 07:46:48 UTC

4850796 idea for pricing the surface pro or other new devices how would it work if, instead of pricing the surface pro at $899. microsoft priced it either higher or lower and then varied it as sales came in.<p>e.g. first day it is released at $500<p>sales spike, they increase price to $550 etc..<p>or they go in reverse:<p>e.g. first day they release at $1500<p>no sales, the decrease to $1450 etc...<p>i understand you'd probably increase buyer remorse if you came down in price, so maybe going up in price makes more sense.<p>you might lose some initial margin from early adopters but you'd be able to define the market better. 2012-11-29 22:56:34 UTC

3421443 ask hn: become a freelancer/contractor or keep working on product in free time? hi all,<p>after reading through the recent thread on freelancer rates
(http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3420203) i'm once again considering making
a go of freelancing, but am worried that it will take my focus away from the
product i'm building in my free time. here's my situation:<p>i'm 26 and i have an awesome day job. we do rails consulting
and i'm surrounded by incredibly bright people in very good working conditions. there's really 
nothing to complain about. the pay is good, but not enough for me to save for
anything substantial before i turn 30 (or fulfill my goal of moving back to
japan with my wife before i turn 30 either).<p>to achieve my goals, last may i started work in my free time on a side
project ((blog.)japanalicious.com). it's subscription-based app that helps you
learn to read japanese. i'm not convinced that it will be the product that will
help me achieve my income goals but it's serving to teach me a hell of a lot
about building/desigining a product and marketing. because it's in my free time,
it's like a startup in ultra-slow motion; sometimes it feels like i'm making
hardly any progress and that perceived momentum is important for morale.<p>at the same time, freelancing/contracting/consulting is something that i think i
could be good at. i'm not afraid of networking with clients, figuring out how to
provide value and then charging accordingly for delivering it. i may be
overconfident with this, but i'm pretty sure that given a couple of years i
could build up enough of a client base and savings to move back to japan and
do remote work exclusively.<p>i read a lot of comments from people on hn who have apparently decades more
experience and i keep seeing the theme of 'transitioning to selling my own
products'. if the end goal is to make your own products, then perhaps i should
just keep working on the products and skip the contracting/consulting phase
entirely? this obviously assumes that i am extremely lucky and japanalicious (or
one of my next few ideas) is successful in making me in the region of 10,000 usd
per month.<p>so for those experienced technical consultants/freelancers, in my situation what
would you do? if you could go back in time to your 26-year-old self, would you
just focus on building products or would you still go the route of freelancing
first?<p>thanks in advance for all feedback. 2012-01-03 21:43:30 UTC

2983766 ask hn: how do you appeal business users? hello,<p>my questions is related to web app for businesses. business people suffer a lot from productivity problems connected to the use of old and non customized software (i am looking at you ms office). however, they do not seem to look for alternatives.<p>in my opinion, especially when it comes to data analysis, there must be a way to appeal business users. but how?<p>linkedin seems a good resource, however people there don't really understand web solutions or any solution outside the commercial software already in existence. 2011-09-11 13:41:23 UTC
1304548 ask hn: added value gateways for s3-like cloud storage providers? as part of a server backup strategy i'm looking for a service that can sync amazon s3 buckets to rackspace cloud files (or any other storage provider).<p>the only service i've found so far that does this is smestorage (http://www.smestorage.com). to describe what they do is easier if i just lift the text from their home page:<p>"we spend our time thinking about the way we can add value to storage clouds. we created the smestorage platform to enable us to add such value! we take existing storage clouds and layer additional features and better ways to access files. things like encryption..."<p>on the face of it it seems like a decent idea but i was surprised i couldn't find out much about them which makes me apprehensive.<p>do you know of any other cloud gateways that offer similar functionality? or have you used smestorage? 2010-04-29 14:38:15 UTC

4528096 maker time and significant others there is a lot of conversation, analysis, and general agreement of the dichotomy of maker time va management time.  i occasionally find myself appling the same concept on top of maker time vs family time.  as a hacker who is soon to be married i often feel like my so doesn't understand when i'm struck with inspiration or motivation and need near a full day to get something out of my head and into code.  i don't even have kids yet and i feel like its hard.<p>so here's my question to the makes who are also family men/women out there: how do you do it and do you think your so understands?  where so you strike your balance? 2012-09-16 02:59:53 UTC
3732772 how do sites like plasticjungle verify gift card balances and prevent fraud i have the below 2 questions that i was hoping somebody from the community would probably be able to help me with:<p>1. say i sell a gift card to plasticjungle (or other similar sites). how do they verify the balance on the gift card? do they check it once they get the physical card (i send them via mail) or do they have some sort of apis exposed by all major retailers to check the balance electronically when i key in the gift card number and the pin on their website? though the latter doesn't sound like how it's done, thought would still ask.<p>2. how do they prevent fraud? say i mailed them the gift card. after getting it, they check and confirm that everything looks good and then they proceed to pay me (check, paypal, amazon gift card). now once i get paid, what if i go ahead and use the gift card online since i know the gift card number and the pin. how do they prevent such a thing? 2012-03-21 02:19:54 UTC
2624833 ask hn: is asking hn readers for funding a good idea? getting funded by investors is good, but not always possible.
why not "apply" to the hn community?
suppose you have a good idea and did not make it in yc or any other program, should you give up?
why not ask here on hn (if not against the rules).
1000 u$ each, 30 investors and you can start.
it should not be too difficult and a good way to test your idea. if it's not good you'll know it.
i am writing this because i raised 20.000 euros in a similar fashion and it was not that hard.

2299483 take a break from your startup, work on mine: need appengine(java) developer hello hn
i tried looking at the regular freelancing websites (elance, odesk...) then i thought communities like hacke news, reddit and stackoverflow maybe better places to look for good developers for relatively new technology.
i need a developer for a google app engine (java) project.
maybe i can hire someone who has been working on their own startup and would like to take some time off for a month or two. 
i am giving all the details below, appreciate your suggestions or responses.<p>skills required
        - good knowledge of google app engine (java), its limitations, tricks, pitfalls and best practices (esp with the datastore)
        - good java skills (speed) and knowledge of oop
        - basic html/css and javascript skills<p><pre><code>    - work schedule
        - the website is to be completed in march so it will start right away
        - in most of march there will be daily communication and almost daily deliveries, so your calendar needs to be free

    - about the website
        - it is a website based on sports, at the start it will focus only on one sport
        - basically fans can follow tournaments, interact with each other and play some simple sport related games (not flash)

    - payment
        - prefer billing by number of hours
        - will pay with my credit card using the option with least overhead
        - willing to make payments weekly/daily...

    - strategy
        - the site will be coded one feature at a time with a very plain html ui. expect something like this:
            - first chunk of work: a user class, a user registration page, login page (session), user's profile editing page, an admin page to view new users
            - second chunk: classes: tournament, match (tournaments consist of matches), a tournament page, a match page, an admin type page to enter and delete data
            - third chunk: user can add tournament or match to his list, this list can be seen on his profile page
        - the nifty features (usually done with javascript) will be implemented with simple basic html elements and minimal javascript
        - once all the features are implemented in the backend i will get a designer to make a photoshop design
        - photoshop design will be converted to html/css (by me or you or another front end designer)
        - site will be operational before april and fixes will be made as required
        - after may the site will be expanded by adding more sports and features

    - current status of project
        - i have a very well definded minimal set of features
            - complete organization of the website (content of each type of page, whats in the menu's where, which page links to what etc)
            - basic layout/wireframe(on paper) of each type of page
        - i have a very well defined deadline too   :)</code></pre>
&#60;/code&#62;&#60;/pre&#62;
if you are interested please reply with your work sample, working hours, hourly rates etc (my email id: sunflight.explore@gmail.com)
again, i appreciate any suggestions you might have for me. 2011-03-08 01:42:39 UTC

on stackoverflow, one solution for storing a million phone numbers is to use a trie. [2][3]  
another way would be to use alphabets as a method of encoding the numbers. for example if all the unicode characters were used in a string we could have 110,000^(string length) [4]  
here pi is displayed to a million digits [5].  as a unicode .txt this is 2mb. if i was to store every combination of number from 0 to this number it could prove to be impossible. how would you suggest storing such large numbers?<p><pre><code>  [1] http://primes.utm.edu/largest.html

6130605 what should i ask for as compensation after becoming fully vested in my startup? i am on the verge of becoming fully vested after a four year stint with my startup.  i currently have a 10% equity stake in the company and take a 75k&#x2f;year salary.  i am going to be negotiating updates to equity and&#x2f;or salary once fully vested at the end of 2013.<p>the company went live in 2010 and we are looking to exit sometime in 2014 via acquisition in the 10-20 million dollar range.<p>i am a co-founder of the company.  we have 5 total employees, with the ceo being the primary stakeholder at 80%.  she takes a salary of 45k&#x2f;yr.  we aren&#x27;t going to be adding employees at a large clip or giving away very much equity in the company at this point.<p>we bring in close to 1m revenue&#x2f;yr.  i have coded about 95% of the product (and it is a pretty large product).<p>thoughts? 2013-07-30 22:41:55 UTC

3601219 how do you manage programming burnout? i went to a colleague today and asked, pointing at my head, "what do you do when you've got the singed feeling?" he knew exactly what i meant, but neither of us had ever talked about it before. i don't know anyone who has written about it. am i missing a whole field of reading material?<p>i do mean manage, not avoid. from years of programming, i know that i only have three to four hours of sustainable programming per day in me, but the last three days i chose to program nine hour days because. i was rebuilding a core data structure, and i knew that i would need an hour per session to get that piece of code into my head. now i'm paying for it. last night my dreams were bizarre, and today i may as well not bother coding at all. tomorrow i might or might not, depending on how well i sleep.<p>so, in the interest of bringing this out of silence, how many hours a day can you program sustainably? how common are the folks who can program much more than three or four hours sustainably (from stories about greenblatt among others, they seem to exist)? how do you manage your good hours? 2012-02-16 23:25:16 UTC

5505401 show hn: fliple - ios contacts with metro ui this is my try at a ios contacts app replacement.
i was frustrated by the fact that the default application wasn't showing contact pictures in lists, so i tried to design an app that makes full use of the images.<p>another issue i had with the default app was the number of taps until finding a contact, so i tried to minimize that too using various approaches:<p>- put most contacted people on the main screen (app also proposes new tiles based on number of interactions)
- group contacts (work, family, friends, etc.) then put a group tile on the main screen
- search the contact list using t9 (3-4 taps to locate contact)
- use action tiles to instantly communicate with a contact (phone, sms, mail) for often contacted people<p>at the moment the app is free, i haven't yet come up with ideas for monetization - if you have any, please share. 2013-04-06 23:07:03 UTC
1265091 ask hn: any good books on graphing/charting/visualization? my day job has me working on a project that has vast amounts of data available in tabular form, but no way to analyze the data except to search it and display it in more tables. pages and pages of tables.<p>i'd love to build a way to query the data and display the results visually, and i'm looking for books that demonstrate various techniques for visualizing data that (in many cases) is quite complex. right now, my experience doesn't really extend beyond basic pie/bar/scatter graphs.<p>i've heard amazing things about tufte, but looking at the previews of his books on amazon they seem mostly focused on artistic presentations of information - something a marketer or analyst would create manually, not dynamic charts generated from terabytes of data. is that the case? does it still have useful information for the sort of thing i'm doing, or can anyone recommend something more suitable? 2010-04-14 15:05:57 UTC

7961893 a hacker news for grad students? i love hacker news. the community . the unsaid agreement to uphold all that is clever and awesome. the shared intelligence of a stimulating community. but i often find myself wishing for a little more (is there no limit to human desire).
don&#x27;t get me wrong i&#x27;ve learned more here than anywhere else. but the relentless noise of software often drowns out interesting posts in math, physics and applied sciences . maybe someplace where grad students and their ilk may share their experiments , thoughts , thought-experiments and engage in futile discussions on the definition of &#x27;insight&#x27; in mathematics .

7302551 show hn: 3seeds – our approach to helping startups develop their product hi everyone,<p>as non-tech founders we confronted a huge problem one year ago: how to develop our product once it was validated. recruiting and hiring would have meant selling our livers.<p>so we ended up working with a great team in eastern europe. we wanted to replicate our experience and we would be delighted to share with you what we’ve learned after 3 months in manual mode and pick your brains on a couple of issues...<p>the shameless part: 3seeds started as a way to match software projects and startups with sw dev teams in eastern europe. successfully matching a few dozen projects was a tremendous learning experience for us (and maybe just as many sleepless nights…) check here a few thoughts on our experience: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;bit.ly&#x2f;1jy0ujd<p>now we’re ready to move to the next iteration and improve our product.<p>what were your challenges in getting your product developed? did you hire or outsource?<p>let me know your feedback, you’re always awesome – http:&#x2f;&#x2f;3seeds.co.uk 2014-02-26 02:56:43 UTC

10018291 is there an affordable library of ui elements for ios development? hello,<p>i’m new to ios development and i’m excited to start learning with the new swift language. the language seems straightforward. unfortunately, i’m the worst at creating good looking uis with fancy animations for my apps. i’m doing my apps on the side and don’t have all day to code them.<p>i work as a microsoft .net programmer and the company that i work for uses telerik to build their pretty uis. it saves a lot of time in ui development. is there something similar in the ios world where i don’t have to pay a leg and an arm for it — currently $499.00 for telerik products. i know there’s free stuff online but i’m wary about the licenses and the lack of updates when new versions of ios come out.<p>any help would very so appreciated. thanks. 2015-08-06 18:14:49 UTC

3784785 ask hn: was silicon valley created out of luck or out of work? i've been spending some time talking to some leaders in my area.  they are a political and economic force in my area - highly regarded and esteemed by millions in my area.<p>their main argument that silicon valley came to existence was because of a lot of luck and money from the government.  there is no difference in the people that work there from the people that work where they live.<p>what do you guys think created sv?  did it come out of a lucky government grant or did it come out of the hard work of the people that lived there?<p>in my personal view, while silicon valley did get some federal funds early on, the vast majority of it's creation was from it's people.  people who did everything they could to actually try and make the world a better place vs just finding another job.  while it does get obsessed with odd stuff (like optimizing for ad clicks), for the most part, the entire place eventually finds its way to change the world for the better. 2012-04-01 20:32:36 UTC

3796756 ask hn: the right way to store settings in a webapp a couple of collegues and i have been wondering for a while now what the right way is to store settings in a webapplication (like a wamp or lamp stack).<p>the mysql database isn't supposed to do this, tables are to store a variable number of rows with a fixed number of columns. storing settings you would either set the variablename in the columnname and the value in a row, or create 2 columns (variable and value) and store variables in rows. either way, the number of rows is constant. not immediately a bad thing, but not ideal either.<p>there is also the lack of hierarchy this way, currently we have a filesystem-like path in use. the variable in the database will be something like "/modules/twitter/username". this is a custom system though, and it works but doesn't really feel right either. unlike a table, files can be placed in the directory along with the right module (part of the application, they can be added or removed as needed).<p>lastly a problem with a database is that you can use one table for all settings, or a new settings table for different modules. using a single table, you would have to clean it up every time you add or delete a module. using multiple tables, you get a long list of tables in the database, often to store only a few variables per application.<p>settings files (ini, json, or another format) feel a lot more like how it should be done, but to open and parse a settings file every pageload seems not too great for performance either. or even if it performed well enough, settings are something that can be loaded into the ram and only written to the disk when changed. mysql can keep file handles opened, doesn't use an interpreted language to read or write the data, and even caches stuff so there is often no disk interaction at all on reading.<p>so... what else could or should we use? nosql perhaps (i'm rather unfamiliar with that)? or is there simply no optimal solution and should we continue to (ab)use the database for this? 2012-04-04 09:04:59 UTC

4624403 ask hn: community-based alternative twitter api here's an idea to get around twitter's admittedly crap api: people install a bookmarklet, browser extension etc. that detects when you are reading twitter, and extracts the tweets from the dom and sends them to a server. if enough people use it then you can start to build up a relatively good alternative to twitter's unreliable and heavily rate-limited api. does anyone know if this would work effectively, and more importantly would it breach twitter's tos? 2012-10-07 20:47:33 UTC

1119830 ask hn: indie markets other than iphone app store i know this is a very old school question to ask but i am new so just humor me please. i started looking into actual development of as an indie developer sometime when the app store was launched and from then on it seems its the only platform for the indie developers.<p>but i know there must have been other markets before the app store, where people can put there apps up for a small fee. i searched a lot but there was no convincing result found. (i think this is the kind of search where you just get lucky if you think of the correct keywords). so i as you people : "what are small markets, for indie developers where one can actually make money?" 2010-02-12 05:06:19 UTC

i am maintaing a public email relay with support for openpgp encryption. i use it at work or at times i am away from my computer. the site uses https, optionally you can encrypt the content with pgp public key. i though somebody else could find it helpful. the service is and always will be free.&lt;p&gt;btw, if you would like to see the interface translated to your native language, let me know, i&#x27;ll send you a template.&lt;p&gt;link: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;pgpsender.org 2013-09-26 18:40:41 UTC

1163299 "ten seconds": a useful iphone app with almost no ui in ~500 lines of obj-c. to elaborate:
it's a camera timer app.  instead of waiting for gorillacam to load and then fiddling with the timer menu, you just start up ten seconds and -ten seconds later- it takes a photo, then exits.&#60;p&#62;full disclosure:
it &#60;i&#62;is&#60;/i&#62; my app, but it's free (&#60;i&#62;and&#60;/i&#62; ad-free) and shall remain that way forever.  so i don't feel too bad about pimping it out to everyone.&#60;p&#62;enjoy, and tell me what you think! 2010-03-03 03:41:29 UTC

6219520 ask hn: co-founder running company to the ground. what can i do? background: i am the cto, co-founder and sole inventor of a very promising technology company (&lt;25 people) and have $1b opportunity, seriously!) . i now have a minority stake (25%) in this company, after my original co-founder was bought out by an angel investor who put in almost $1m and is now the ceo.<p>the problem is he is a big jerk (one customers&#x27; words not mine) and is running the company into the ground, because of his ego and imperious&#x2f;dictatorial personality. this is narcissistic personality disorder to the nth degree. customers - who are super eager to work with us - offline mention to me that how &quot;difficult&quot; he is to work with, i am very concerned we are headed for complete disaster.<p>i have tried talking to him to step away, mildly and couple of times confrontational. it has only led to yelling matches and strained our relationship and i am at a loss what to do.
i have even tried to ask him to sell his stakes to me so he gets his $ back - no avail.<p>i know since the ceo invested and technically owns the &quot;ip&quot; (which is a nebulous term), is essentially algorithms which we developed over last few years. can i quit, legally &quot;hand over&quot; the code-base, repositories, computers etc. i.e. fulfil my legal obligations. following that rewrite the algorithms from scratch as separate entity? would that be violating the law?<p>p.s. i am talking to an attorney and seeking legal advice. but would like to hear similar experiences<p>p.p.s. we have filed for patents, but those won&#x27;t be examined until 2018 or so...as with many complex systems, can be challenged in court as being public domain vs proprietary - some components use public domain algorithms.<p>thanks so much in advance! 2013-08-15 17:56:47 UTC

2907325 ask hn: what would you study if you could redo college hi everyone, this is my first post on hn, but i've been reading for a couple of years now. i'm entering my senior year of high school and have been thinking a lot about colleges and what i want to study. i've always enjoyed math and science so i figure i'll probably end up in some sort of engineering career. additionally, i've been teaching myself python and really enjoying it; i try to read programming books and write programs for an hour or two each day.<p>i'm wondering what you all would major in if you had the chance to redo college knowing what you know now. i'd also like to know what your opinion is of cs as a major. is a cs degree useful for learning to write code better, or does it make more sense to focus on some other engineering field and learn to program on your own to be more well rounded? i'm a little worried that getting a cs degree would give me less options than, say getting a mechanical or electrical engineering degree and learning to program on the side.<p>thanks for reading 2011-08-20 18:32:51 UTC

1382584 ask hn: contracting marketplaces in the uk?  running low on cashflow with our bootstrapped operation, i'm looking into doing some freelancing work in london.<p>however, most of the contracting websites i know of, tend to describe contracts in terms of skills required; whereas i tend to excel (both in selling, and building) in turning concepts into finished products.<p>this dissonance has been bugging me for a while, so here i turn to the nice hn community: which contracting sites would you recommend for uk-based freelancers, where jobs are described in terms of what to build? 2010-05-27 03:27:34 UTC

3422628 looking for front end development work hi everyone,<p>thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read this, my name is william porter i'm 19 years old and instead of committing my holidays to a department store i thought i'd dedicate my time to something i'm more passionate about, websites.<p>i've been working with websites for the past 3 years and front end development for the past year, mainly on personal projects but late 2011 had the opportunity to work on 4 commercial projects which was a great experience, i learnt a lot and wish to consolidate that experience with further freelance work.<p>i predominately work with psd to html conversions in the past with technologies such as jquery and css but i'm looking to expand my skills and accepting most jobs revolving around front end work.<p>i may not be the best experienced but i'm hard working, i have the drive to learn new skills and i'm passionate about what i do.
what you get with me is a friendly communication experience, you don't get the canned responses from say a traditional boxed service for instance, i listen to what you have to say and i strive to coming up with the best solutions.<p>thank you so much for reading and if you'd like to contact me my details are below.<p>website: http://wporter.com (can see some of my previous work)<p>email: william@wporter.com 2012-01-04 03:35:22 UTC

8208582 ask hn: would this method work to split equity of a startup? i am a developer&#x2f;entrepreneur, and a couple of weeks ago i went to see a friend of mine who owns a chain of stores. i asked him what problems he was currently facing while managing his business, because i wanted to see if i could solve them with software. out of this discussion came the idea for a b2b software that will solve a big problem for him and potentially for many other stores.<p>since the idea looks promising, i said i would start developing it right away, and he said he would like to join me as a co-founder, saying he wants to help with the sales part, and that he is ok with me having the larger equity.<p>we didn&#x27;t discuss specific percentages yet, and i am also not sure how much he will be able to contribute, as he owns and runs 10+ stores as his full time job.<p>i am trying to come up with a fair way to split the equity, and here&#x27;s my idea:<p>1. we say that developing the product is 50% of the job, and selling it is 50%.<p>2. since i&#x27;ll be developing it myself, i already own 50% of the product, so we just need to figure out how to split the remaining 50% (i.e., the sales part).<p>3. once we start selling the product, we track how many sales each of us will generate during the first year. i expect that he will mainly sell via his network of contacts, while i will focus on selling it online, so we wouldn&#x27;t duplicate efforts.<p>4. after one year we split the 50% sales equity according to the percentage of sales generated by each one. for example, if we sell similar amounts each one gets 25%, so i end up with 75% of the business and he with 25%. if he outsells me 4 to 1, he gets 40% and i get 60% (50% + 10%).<p>i believe this could be fair and even productive, as it would stimulate each of us to give our best trying to market the product.<p>do you guys think this would work? 2014-08-21 17:41:18 UTC

2643189 ask hn: how can i find a "mission critical" company/consumer problem? steven blank describes in the four steps to the epiphany that successful startups supply a "must-have" consumer product or solve a mission critical company problem.  my problem has been with idea creation. i've been developing 'cool' ideas, but nothing that people absolutely need.<p>i really like blank's book and i agree with his theory about developing a product hypothesis then talking to potential customers to test if the product is needed. this is basically a way to find customers first, see what they want then begin to build.  but my question is, what if you don’t have a product hypothesis? how can you generate product/service ideas that are "must-have?" i've been told to "scratch my own itch," but many great startups are b2b. and finding problems that specific businesses face without being apart of that business is difficult. the same can be said for specific consumer markets. 2011-06-11 04:10:43 UTC

2163958 ask hn: any entrepreneurs on hn who launched themselves from a f1 or h1b visa? i have mostly been a lurker around here for a long time learning from the valuable experience of a number of people here. i have read numerous startup stories but after a short discussion with my friends during lunch, i thought of one thing: why don't i read stories from student-turned or employee-turned (h1b sponsored) entrepreneurs?<p>i am curious to know whether an international student (generally on an f-1 visa) or someone on a h1b visa (employed by some company after graduation) can do a startup.<p>any information on the following would be awesome:<p>question 1: can someone on a f-1 or a h1b visa start a startup and still own it? if not, what can be done?<p>myth 1: i heard that unless you are a citizen, you cannot own a company.<p>question 2: can someone on an f-1 or a h1b visa raise seed capital from vcs?<p>myth 2: i heard that vc's don't really bother with people on these visas.<p>question 3: can we apply for a patent on an idea that we came up with while still being a student or employed by a company.<p>myth 3: i heard that the company or the university will take ownership of the patent if you apply for one while still working for them even though you did not use any of their resources.<p>if you are an international (student)/(employee on a h1b visa) and you recently had a startup experience could you kindly write down your story and some thoughts on the above questions? this would help not just me but a number of other people who are facing a similar situation.<p>i did my homework and came across the following link. while it is an awesome post, the author's experience is a little dated. not really sure if anything has changed since then<p>http://www.k9ventures.com/2009/09/my-story-and-support-for-the-founders-visa/ 2011-02-01 01:07:18 UTC

4045891 ask hn: startup founder - should i default on my mortgage? i wanted to get advice from fellow hn founders who may have faced a similar situation.<p>background...
i am the co-founder of a profitable but young tech startup (&#60;3 years).  my wife and i own a home currently with a 6+% 30 yr fixed rate mortgage.  we've had this rate for 6 years and have never been late on a single monthly payment.  but since rates are much lower, we want to refinance.  based on the math with current rates, refinancing to a 7/1 arm will knock our monthly payment down by 40% (big savings).<p>when the startup was making nothing, i opportunistically called our mortage provider (wells fargo) to see if i qualified for any of the gov't relief programs for mortgages, and i was told i had too many assets to qualify.  i was not distressed enough i guess.  this wasn't surprising.<p>fast forward to this week...
i went back to wells fargo since i am now paying myself a salary and coupled with my wife, our income is good.  the wells fargo team asked if i was an owner of the company after reviewing our personal taxes, and then asked for the company returns in addition to all the personal financial details (bank accounts, paystubs, 401ks, tax docs, etc).<p>and the verdict was...
our income (meaning my income since my wife works at big co) is not enough or stable enough to qualify for a re-finance.<p>the 'perverted' part of this whole equation is that if my mortage payment fell by 40%, i'd think that would make my wife and me much better credit risks to wells fargo.  but oh well, i was too credit-worthy to qualify for distressed programs and not credit-worthy enough for a refinance.<p>but enough woe is me...my current debate/questions are:<p>- should i call wells fargo and tell them that i'm going to stop paying my mortgage. basically engage them in a game of chicken.
- try to goto banks with looser standards?
- or do something else altogether?<p>anyone who has been in or seen a similar mortgage dilemma who can share some wisdom?  or if you work in the mortage industry and know how to beat the man, pls share that as well :)<p>i'm counting you on hn.  and of course, this ain't my real hn account. 2012-05-31 01:50:08 UTC

1133393 ask hn: i just don't care anymore. any advice? i've recently realized that college is killing my desire to do anything programming related. however, as i'm a full-time student without a job, dropping out and not working at burger king boils down to getting lucky (although i've had a few headhunters call me, so maybe that's a start).<p>the reason i'm so underwhelmed is that in highschool, i really took off with a passion for computer programming. by my senior year, i was fairly fluent in python and php, and i was spending time reading and working my hardest to finish the exercises in structure and interpretation of computer programs. in addition to that, i started working (and have kept on working) at mastering c, common lisp and haskell. it was somewhere between starting to read "godel, escher, bach" and learning the basics of the theory of computation that i also fell in love with mathematics. i was pretty apathetic towards everything related to highschool, but i could take ap classes and get an 'a' with no effort while spending the rest of my time studying things i cared about, so it didn't seem all that bad. when applying to college, i had scores to get into/get noticed by a couple of nice-to-decent range schools (columbia, rit, rose hulman; my gpa/scores were consistent with the bar for duke, cmu and others). the problem is, while i had put in minimal effort to get a really high gpa and nice test scores, i wasn't the minority captain of the football ymca church team thing, so i didn't really stand a chance of getting scholarships at nicer schools. since i have to pay for everything myself, i decided to enroll at the state university which gave me a nice chunk of cash to attend. problem solved, right?<p>fast forward to college, where my first programming class considers 'for' looping and arrays to be advanced techniques, and where showing that you know more than what is taught is actually considered <i>cheating</i>, and i'm burnt after the first semester. the thing is, there are so many things that i don't know (and so many of them are things that i want to learn), so the idea of just 'dropping out' is absurd, since i'm sure there are people here who can help me learn the material even better than if i was doing it on my own. at the same time, every class is a boring trudge that promises me that it's the last boring class i'll have to take and then it'll all be exciting from here and blah blah blah blah. the litmus test i used recently was "if i didn't have a scholarship, would i pay to take this class?" i realized that i probably would not pay for a single cs class offered here. i made it through last semester fairly unscathed, but this time around i feel an extreme apathy setting in. my grades are just at the beginning point of slipping - they're not quite terrible, but they're not the high 'a's i'm used to. this is purely due to my lack of interest.<p>what should i do? should i just drop out? that seems like a bad idea, since at this point i know enough to know i don't know that much at all. should i switch to something non-cs, and then just study cs on my own while occasionally popping in and picking the brains of the faculty? i'm sure some of you who've been through this exact dilemma are scoffing at me not finding the obvious answer myself through "soul-searching", but i really haven't found anyone who feels the same way i do to discuss this with. i've gone for too long without asking for help or advice. 2010-02-18 04:21:30 UTC
8734338 ask hn: do you have a girlfriend? is it good to have one? i seem to be of the age everyone else works on making out with other people. and, a girl told me today that i&#x27;m a &quot;lot more of a nerd&quot;, and an unlikely to find a girl for the rest of my life.<p>that was quite hurting, but, i think programmers don&#x27;t usually have girlfriends, do they ? i mean, do you ? does it distract you from your work ? 2014-12-11 12:22:46 UTC

9510000 ask hn: where did you meet your significant other? my learning from past experiences is that the more women i meet and get to know, the less likely i am to stay single for long. i guess it&#x27;s a basic case of supply and demand.<p>the problem is that ever since i graduated from college and started working at a big tech company, i&#x27;ve come to realize that the number of new people i&#x27;m meeting has dramatically reduced. but what concerns me is when it comes to women: i haven&#x27;t even made any new girl friend (as a friend being a girl :) in the past year.<p>what is odd is that people around me (at work, and more generally in the tech industry) don&#x27;t seem to be more single than anywhere else.<p>it&#x27;s getting me to my question: where did you meet your partner? was it in college?? do you have any advices as to where i could meet more people (i&#x27;ve attended a language meetup group, but everybody was 30 years older than me)? 2015-05-08 04:47:58 UTC

320415 the problem of a lack of downvoting. recently, i've noticed that a lot of the articles reaching the frontpage of hn, and often the top thereof, were flamebait/troll blog posts, off-topic (e.g. politics), or whatever.  but moreso, the majority of posters in the comments often agreed that the article was junk!  as such, one wonders, how in the world did the article rise to the top?<p>the problem is that when you don't allow downvoting, while it prevents the problem on sites like reddit and digg of "organized downvotes" and hivemind downvoting of disagreeing views, it also means that something's score depends solely on the number of upvotes.  so, if you post something extremely controversial that doesn't belong on hn, it can get more upvotes that most other posts.  why is this?  here's an example (let's say hn has 1000 readers, for simple math):<p>let's say you post article a, a politics piece railing against, say... nancy pelosi.  lots of people are going to look at it, since its controversial, and everyone has an opinion.  let's say 50% of hn readers look at it, and 20% of those upvote it, and 60% of those would have wanted to downvote it.  with downvotes, the article would have been buried quickly.  but this article gets 100 upvotes and quickly flies to the top.<p>now, let's say you post a very interesting article on creative use of assembly, article b.  not nearly as many people will look at it--let's say 10% of readers.  and let's say 40% of those upvote it, and 10% of those would have downvoted it if they could.  the article only gets 40 upvotes, despite being much better and more on-topic hn content.<p>it seems to me to be much like the classic "color of the bikeshed" issue; if its something everyone has an opinion about, it gets voted up even if the majority of people think the link is junk or offtopic.<p>now, my question is--how can this problem be resolved without reintroducing the problem of downvotes? 2008-10-01 05:44:10 UTC

1126448 ask hn: best way to dive into web development. so, a little background.  i got my computer science degree 3.5 years ago and have done a good amount of development.  at the time, i was not at all interested in web development but (in large part due to hn) i have been gaining interest.  recently, i had an idea that i'm really excited to try out, but i have no idea how to get started.  hence, i'm asking how to start learning.  i want to learn both the theory and practice.<p>summary:<p>i know how code and have dealt with some fairly large projects in the past.<p>i am a complete web newbie.<p>any suggestions on how i can get started?<p>thanks in advance! 2010-02-15 12:45:20 UTC

5227068 ask hn: who wants to learn javascript? after helping my cofounder get started with programming, i've been thinking it might be fun to help other startup-minded folks learn too. are there any designers/entrepreneurs reading hn who want to learn javascript from scratch?<p>next saturday, february 23, starting at 9am pst, i'll be giving a free 4+ hour javascript workshop online. we'll start from the absolute beginning and build up to the hard stuff. you can use what you learn anywhere javascript runs, from web browsers, to servers, mobile devices and even some databases.<p>why not just make screencasts? because i want to experience those "ah-ha!" moments with you, when you first grasp each difficult concept. that's at least half the fun.<p>this will be limited to 5 people, to keep it conversational. if you're interested, send me an email (see profile) describing why you want to learn javascript and your current level of experience. this workshop is absolutely free. all i ask in return is that you give me honest feedback about the course material, the medium, and my delivery.<p>thanks hn! 2013-02-15 16:58:38 UTC

1695238 the most powerful colors in the world ...and how you make the next ones as a yc w10 startup, we were lucky to have dinner with zuckerberg and i asked him afterwards why he chose that blue for facebook... cause he's color blind.  not a majestic response about how color influences mood, buying habits, etc.<p>he used a color that was personally best for him.  and a lot of the top brands in the world now, started in garages &#38; workshops... where the branding research consisted of a couple rounds "what if we..." before a name was born and then a logo &#38; design.<p>my favorite example of this is mercedes.  the brand now stands for luxury cultivates a significant vibe... but why did the founder call it that? simply, he named the company after his daughter... and now people name their daughters after the car!<p>a lot of yc companies get greif for their names (most.ly the ly.ly ones) but how much does a name / brand have on the actual product being successful.<p>i think it can have an influence, but at the end of the day... the quality of what you build will determine its success.<p>with that in mind, my fellow hackers &#38; founders... from a guy that runs a website about color... be more adventurous with your colors. have some fun. 2010-09-15 18:11:52 UTC

4241330 windows 8 mail leaves users pining for the desktop—or even their phones the e-mail client in windows 8 is the shell of a potentially good application—but microsoft hasn't given it the proper care it deserves. with less than a month before windows 8 hits rtm, mail is a mess that doesn't support imap, can't connect to servers with self-signed certificates, and lacks basic features like flagging messages for followup. metro mail is feature-deficient compared not just to other desktop and tablet apps—it's behind microsoft's own phone platform. whether used on a tablet or desktop, this in-depth look concludes that metro mail in its current form will have users pining for a real desktop application. 2012-07-13 19:07:48 UTC

2128325 ask hn: pharmaceutical bigco wants to acquire my ipad app. advice? hey hn, throwaway account here.<p>my partner and i created an ipad app and it's been pretty successful (especially considering it was only a 4 week investment). the app is in the top 100 us &#38; china, covered by nyt, abc, gizmodo, etc.<p>now a bigco pharmaceutical is asking to buy the app (not the company), code and all. they want to rebrand it and re-release it as one of their products.<p>we are an llc, but we didn't take any funding, so we don't have any "advisors" as such. we're technicians, not lawyers, and we are more or less clueless on the best way to go about negotiating (and closing) this deal.<p>what advice can you give us on negotiating? are there any hners out there that have been through this sort of mini-acquisition before that are willing to reach out to us? (please comment and i'll ping you via my normal account). have any good links to read?<p>a few details you might want to know:<p>* our app's revenue was &#60;$10k in the last 30 days, but it hasn't been out very long.<p>* we've been getting a good deal of press, but we don't think it will last. now is probably a good time to exit.<p>* we'd love to sell. we're not that emotionally invested into the product; this app isn't our life passion (it was actually started as joke)<p>we'd be grateful for any advice you have for us.<p>p.s.
just finished reading:<p>[1] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1985552<p>[2] http://www.davidgcohen.com/2010/06/18/you-have-acquisition-interest-now-what/<p>[3] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1639523<p>[4] http://giffconstable.com/2010/11/selling-your-company-some-core-questions/<p>[5] http://www.seattle20.com/tv/clip/startupday-2010-exit-strategies-for-startups-by-hadi-partovi.aspx<p>thanks! 2011-01-21 18:35:15 UTC

723515 ask hn: what are the best tools for doing reports on your data? what are the best tools out there (open source preferably) to produce reports regularly from our app database?<p>like many of you, we track a lot of things in our startup, from analytics to the funnel, to internal business processes. however, periodically we'd like to see other more detailed events for sanity or cross checking, in a report-type fashion. this is the kind of thing that excel would do nicely, after extracting from our db (mysql, via csv), but that's a pain to do periodically. we'd like to see things like a graph of events of type x per day, or per day of the week, or per week, for a certain period. at the moment we have a few reports generated on demand in the admin pages, with our app (in ror) a graphics library using a fixed set of queries.<p>what tools do you use/recommend for doing this? 2009-07-25 18:30:23 UTC

3033854 suggest hn: downvote button should prompt for a comment the idea is pretty simple: if you go to downvote a comment, the system should prompt for a comment of your own as to why you're doing so.<p>i have a few reasons why i think this would be a good idea:<p>a) downvoting someone without a comment doesn't give the user context for /why/ it was downvoted, leaving them in a confused state. did someone merely disagree, or did the comment violate an unspoken community rule?<p>in essence, a teaching moment is lost. a downvote with a comment lets people know what the community expects, which helps us to maintain what hacker news is about. when new users see a marginalized comment, they'll know why that happened.<p>b) it's well known in psychology that people tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. a score of -4 is a lot worse feeling than a score of +4 is positive feeling. this has a subtle effect on user incentives.<p>in the current system, i think it incentivizes people to post something that they know will be popular but that doesn't add much to the discussion, rather than something interesting but perhaps more nuanced and easily misunderstood. by adding slightly more friction to the down voting process, i think it will make people more thoughtful as to why they're doing it. i think this will also add more civility to the discussions. 2011-09-24 17:56:37 UTC

1418276 ask hn: my snail mail has me going postal i've come to my whit's end when it comes to managing my real life inbox: the mailbox in my driveway.<p>it's enough to drive a person mad. not only do i receive tons of worthless crap everyday (those senders should be prosecuted and sent to prison for destroying the environment and wasting everyone's time) - i also get statements from the bank/credit cards that have sensitive information in them.<p>after moving a couple of times in the past few years i'm sure there have been plenty of opportunities for identity theft of my info. it's probably just pure luck it hasn't happened yet.<p>my question is this: how the hell do i stop snail mail from coming to my address? there is one solution i know of at http://www.earthclassmail.com/ which might be a little pricey but for the peace of mind it definitely seems worth it.<p>anyone else out there had success with this "problem"? any solutions you know of i could try? i'm thinking of having a giant bonfire in the backyard otherwise.. 2010-06-09 21:00:49 UTC
1099595 ask hn the case for going all openid vs. local accounts vs. both we are implementing a user system and wanted to base it entirely off openid. we will store some account details, but use openid for all authentication and such. we were curious how much pushback we will get from people that don't have openid or like have separate accounts for various things. who want to sign up and make a password on our system. should we allow both? anyone with experience with either case? 2010-02-04 02:33:33 UTC

	do you remember your first cs class? how there were a few people who just couldn’t handle the obscure bugs and the hours upon hours of staring at the screen and they ended up dropping out? i can honestly say that i’ve never had a moment of doubt about my career. to me there is nothing more gratifying than fixing that last little bug, or better yet, having a piece of code work perfectly the very first time i run it.
	i’m a realist and i understand that most programming is not quite the exciting world of cutting-edge algorithms that google and facebook make it out to be. 
honestly, i don’t care.
give me a problem to solve and i won’t give up unitl it kneels before me.
i love linux, unix and the keyboard and hate touching the mouse.
i program for profit in whatever language you want (java, jsp, html, css) and for fun in whatever language (google go, python, bash) can solve a problem for me.<p>if you think you would like to work with someone like me, please contact me at 555-867-5309 or at (something)@gmail.com.<p>sincerely,

6818474 ask hn: why not use this for cryptocurrencies? i remember after reading about dynamo and riak that vector clocks can be used to establish a partial ordering of transactions.<p><pre><code>  * http:&#x2f;&#x2f;en.wikipedia.org&#x2f;wiki&#x2f;vector_clock
  * http:&#x2f;&#x2f;en.wikipedia.org&#x2f;wiki&#x2f;lamport_timestamps
</code></pre>
perhaps additional mechanisms would be needed to ensure the actual timestamp of something, but overall, some version of vector clocks and signatures might avoid proof of work entirely. has anyone investigated along this direction? i think ripple may have something closer to this than bitcoin. 2013-11-29 08:48:11 UTC

1819856 new to hn, overloaded by information i'm an outsider to the development community.  i enjoy thinking about software and media, however, and came up with an idea that i've been working on for a year now.  i started my own llc and began contracting with freelance developers.  as a recent applicant to the yc winter session, i'm told to participate and post on the forum to give the yc crew an idea about how i think.<p>there's a big problem though: i don't know the language of the profession well enough to contribute my input to the vast majority of content i see on the forum.  i feel like attempting to participate in a discussion in which i know %40 of what is really going on only sets me up to look woefully incompetent.<p>any help out there for guys like me who are new to the culture of developers? 2010-10-22 14:44:34 UTC

8838135 what the p2p foundation did in 2014 (1): founders’ report  2015-01-05 10:30:27 UTC
4173696 i am stuck to set priorities in my career. i would like to ask for some advise. i'm enthusiastic about programming with strong desire to grow but the problem is i am struggling to set priorities in what to work on next and what skills to build and polish.<p>basically there are just too many things that i think either interesting or just important for me to work on to succeed. 
1. i work as a .net software developer at company which specialised in building high load web applications on .net framework. i do my best and would like to bring more value and build expertise in what is needed at work. so i need to invest time at work and at home to read blogs on actual problems at work, write pet apps, read other people code in .net etc.
2. i am interested in trying to learn some jvm functional language (scala or clojure). i tend to want to leave .net in some years for something else and jvm languages are possible candidates.
3. at the same time i have an idea to create my startup application - to get some understanding of business, to get my own thing done. i wouldn't like to use .net for it but node.js for real-time chat and rails.
4. i would like also to learn some foundamentals of computer science: to build my expertise in algorithms, ml, etc.<p>the problem is i can't do all these things now and i am struggle to choose what to focus on. if i try to focus on some point from the list i feel i lose some opportunities in other points. say i am doing some node.js for a week and staring to think if what i do is the best choice or i can invest my time and put efforts into .net things and bring more contribution to my current job etc.<p>does anyone have the same problem? how can one manage to finally set priorities, calm down and start doing hard work without any doubts? may be some advice, some book etc. thanks. 2012-06-28 20:17:05 UTC

139594 elitism is the new black? a karma whoring social network idea time and again i read comments here on hn about new features with the catch that they are only open to users of a certain karma threshold, so as to keep a standard of quality. the "gigs" thread comes to mind. hey that's cool; i think we can all get behind a little elitism, especially when karma points are being thrown around like something really throwable.<p>so, i'm proposing the mecca of elitist social networking sites. any page created can be assigned karma thresholds for viewing, commenting, voting, whatever. to place a widget onto your page, you must meet its karma requirements. want to view my new page? you must be this karmic to enter. want to read my latest hack? that will cost you 1 point deposited to my account.<p>but those were not very good examples; there isn't any point in restricting your audience. but for abilities such as embedding pictures and video that can be abused, the karma requirements would be set very high by the karmic gods themselves (the top 100 users). 2008-03-18 05:12:43 UTC

5307798 the ways of javascript inheritance hey hacker news!  lets talk about prototypal inheritance in js!<p>what's the best way of doing it from a code reusability standpoint?<p>what's the best way of doing it from a time to create instance standpoint?<p>what's the best way of doing it from memory footprint standpoint?<p>of the ways i've seen and tried, john's method seems the easiest to use: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/<p>but i hate that it has to loop through every property every time you extend a prototype.<p>most inheritance patterns i've seen need to have the original prototype cloned or instantiated in order extend a new prototype safely.  is there a way to do it that allows all instances at all levels of the inheritance chain to still share the same common methods in memory where they aren't overridden?<p>thanks! 2013-03-02 00:17:39 UTC

7934301 ask hn: should developers be writing technical documentation? not to be confused with the question: &quot;should developers document their code?&quot;. i have no problem with developers working on internal documentation. should developers be writing external documentation for their code that customers will be using? this includes installation, terminology, how and when to use apis, etc.<p>the company i work for has developers writing customer facing technical documentation and this has always felt off to me. proper documentation takes a different level of skill, and i don&#x27;t feel that writing the code automatically makes me qualified to correctly express how the code should be used. this often results on poor customer facing documentation.<p>i personally feel that technical documentation takes a different level of skill and developers should be focused on developing. am i just griping too much? do other companies do this? 2014-06-23 20:11:12 UTC
