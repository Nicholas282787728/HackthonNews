1257886	the reason twitter bought tweetie: user experience	the reason that twitter bought tweetie is that they are no longer content to own the platform, they also want to own the user experience. with this increased interest in the user experience, twitter has changed their ability to impact the customer ecosystem and how they may try and monetize in the future.	2010-04-11 23:13:31 UTC	http://customerecosystem.com/2010/04/11/the-reason-twitter-bought-tweetie-user-experience/	1
1962363	ask hn: advice on software contracting 	i'm in talks with another company that would like to use me as a contractor to build mobile applications for "their brand".  we had tentatively agreed to a ballpark _fixed_ price--we haven't signed anything yet.  however, there are 3 issues that are emerging:<p>* their concept of what features they "want" in their apps is extremely vague. i don't think they're being deceitful (planning to dump additional features on me at the last minute). rather, i think they genuinely don't have a vision for what they want and they would simply prefer that i "take care" of almost everything (more on this below).<p>* despite the lack of a _specific_ vision for what they want, there has already been some "feature-creep" and i'm concerned that the addition of features will blossom if we consummate the deal. the feature-creep is compounded by the fact that the feature requests are not fleshed-out, so when i see a new feature request i'm left wondering "how much will it take to implement feature x?"  when i ask them for additional detail, it's clear that they don't have a clear vision of what they want.<p>* it also seems that they would prefer it if i just ran/maintained the applications on my own (they don't want to be bothered with the technical headaches).  however, these applications require at least 1 remote server (the applications will routinely query a remote database), so what initially seemed like a "build us some mobile apps" contract is turning into a "build us some apps and an infrastructure and maintain everything" contract.<p>my gut instinct is to convert this into an hourly "pay as we go" contract.  however, i don't want to completely turn the tables on them over the fixed price and i'm trying to come up with a hybrid approach. i'd like to structure something that protects <i>me</i> against feature-creep and something that protects <i>them</i> against slipping deadlines.<p>so, my questions are:<p>1) any general advice on how to proceed?<p>2) has anyone structured contracts like this: "i'll build you a piece of software with features x y z.  i expect that it will take me 6 weeks of full-time work and i will charge $a. any additional feature requests or revisions beyond those features are billed at $b.<p>thanks for any insight!	2010-12-02 15:21:09 UTC		1

8336292	ask hn: how would you write front end code for bookkeeping app?	a lot has been said about writing and organizing frontend code. tools like grunt.js, clojurescript, all sorts of reactive libraries and all-in-one frameworks have been invented. but every time i see something like this discussed it&#x27;s mostly about rich-ui web-services, one-page apps, stuff like netflix and such, but it is very different from what your typical back-office app. clear ui is the key for the front-end site, but crms and such are notoriously known for their insanely complicated interfaces. one-page js-apps also don&#x27;t seem like a good idea here, as things are complicated enough without that and dramatic changes in ui happen on a day-to-day basis, not once in a while like on your front page. i don&#x27;t really see how should i organize and compile clojurescript sources, when i&#x27;m using pretty much unique js-code for each page.<p>both users and developers often don&#x27;t really care about that, because business-logic is the king on the back-office side. but still, have you any articles that would talk about that or maybe you have some thoughts of your own? i&#x27;m writing stuff like that for quite some time now, but still have that feel that there could be some way to do it <i>right</i>, and i&#x27;m not even close to it.	2014-09-18 17:01:52 UTC		1

5200580	ask hn: explosive growth or bootstrapped? out of my depth. 	my startup, geddit, has started getting some attention from business angels, potential mentors, accelerators and the like.<p>we are building a tool that enables and analyses the feedback cycle between students and educators to improve education (link in profile). the business model is currently a pure-product play. we have a tool that addresses certain pain points among our customers, and we had intended to use a freemium model to market and distribute the product. scaling would require marketing and direct sales.<p>a potential mentor recently had the insight that the product offering did not have enough supporting leverage to really become a player, if someone made a big play to capture students and other users of education. his suggestion was that we create an education focussed rating platform - something like tripadvisor for education, gain traction and scale really quickly to create a lever for our product.<p>his sketch was traction in the next 6 months, ~$0.5m funding round by november. my instincts are that this is ludicrous, but his point seemed strong and well made - we shouldn't fall in love with our solution, we should solve the problem. i want to be able to ask this guy smart questions - here's what i have so far:<p>- how do you expect to make a return on your time and effort?<p>- what sort of traction would we require (number and % of users) to move to 1.) a funding round that big and 2.) the feedback product rollout?<p>- what specific experience or connections do you have that would help us believe you can do this?<p>what else should i be asking? who else should we be talking to? what can we read? all input appreciated.	2013-02-11 13:13:08 UTC		1

8413990	selling a site on flippa	i own a website (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.bongotones.com) that i started in 2009. at it&#x27;s peak we were doing 250k a year from advertisement. due to some unfortunate issues, bad business decisions (eg. bad money spent on seo, design work, etc), business partners being spread across different cities and just priorities we let go of the site. it still has great potential with some tlc. in our prime we were number 3 on google for &quot;free ringtones&quot; and over the past 5 years have had over 52million page views and 6million unique views.
the problem with selling on flippa is that lately due to us not having time to keep the site up and only making money from adsense the revenue has dropped dramatically but we do have a database of over 180k registered users and 120k ringtones. i think that&#x27;s where the value of the website is now, a pr3 website with over 6million pages indexed on google and the database.
i&#x27;m posting the link here to see if anyone would be interested or get some guidance from people on how to go about selling this.<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;flippa.com&#x2f;3277671-pr-3-187000-registered-users-122000-ringtones-6-3m-indexed-pages<p>thanks!	2014-10-06 01:30:30 UTC		2

7339750	project release .. extreme stress	working on a small startup .. a fresh developer 
been working on web development for about 5months now .. 3 of which were just html&#x2f;css&#x2f;js
then we had a project a private project built using node.js and mongo 
i learnt a lot .. first release was a very good job everyone was pleased including me .. 
but then we wanted to add new features .. and i have a deadline of a month .. which basically ends today and i do not like the way i wrote the code 
and i am not ashamed to say that i needed some sort of management&#x2f;help because i am still learning .. but i did not have that the whole past month .. and i feel that i fucked everything up
it works .. but the code is sloppy and the logic is not good enough .. too many bugs which has been solved using brute force .. <i>just solve it</i>
no good design .. not good thinking about problems and how to solve them .. just solve it using whatever code .. that&#x27;s what i did 
and i don&#x27;t like it and i feel it will be a major screw up<p>maybe there is nothing to do about it now .. too late i mean 
i am just looking for some comfort in your stories .. maybe someone has been there before ..
i don&#x27;t even like web development but it pays off and i need it just like anyone needs the money
although i am really happy <i>despite everything</i> that i learned new things<p>but i really do not have a clue how to deal with this stress 
i am actually scared !	2014-03-04 12:22:55 UTC		2

5851493	my (apples) solution to beating the nsa	after the recent fallout over prism, i have a solution that is practical and simple for everyone to use:<p>the idea exists in an apple patent here:
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;patft.uspto.gov&#x2f;netacgi&#x2f;nph-parser?sect1=pto1&amp;sect2=hitoff&amp;d=pall&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2fnetahtml%2fpto%2fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=g&amp;l=50&amp;s1=8,205,265.pn.&amp;os=pn&#x2f;8,205,265&amp;rs=pn&#x2f;8,205,265<p>and summarized here:
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.cultofmac.com&#x2f;175422&#x2f;apple-patents-lying-to-those-who-are-spying&#x2f;<p>i roughly propose an open source application that can run when you are not using the computer, similar to the seti program.<p>it may take a dictionary that randomises all user activity to a point that it is undetectable from real activity.<p>search terms and habits may be shared randomly among users, and it would not only solve the nsa issue but also the big corporate issue too.<p>i would use a dictionary without the keywords relating to kiddy porn and terrorism.
i imagine that this would work like a democracy that would leave users exposed that are on the outside of what society deems acceptable.<p>please provide some feedback.	2013-06-10 00:35:39 UTC		2

1153379	ask hn: is doing a phd from oxford a better option than a research based job?	i have got an admit for distributed computing in wireless sensors at oxford university. after my m.s. and a couple of years of working in the silicon valley, i was inclined to look for a job in an innovative startup or an industry research lab. but because of being on a h1b, i could not find anything satisfactory in the time-frame i had (i had to urgently look for a job between march '09 and july '09 - and couldn't find anything at that time). 
hence, rather than settling for a 'mundane' job, i decided to apply for a phd. now, after getting an admit at oxford, i am at a crossroad- should i go in for a three year doctoral program or hold out for that 'research focused job' that i am looking for. 
some factors to consider are- i am currently self-employed in my home country working on a well-paying but uncertainity laden freelance consulting gigs.&#60;p&#62;my topic of interest is here:
http://urbansensors.com&#60;p&#62;any ideas or suggestions about the research interest or if there is something different that i should be exploring right now are welcome.	2010-02-26 16:09:54 UTC		3

8784336	ask hn: best way for online payments by installments?	our saas isn&#x27;t recurring subscription based. users get access by making one time payments.<p>because our prices are too high, most clients are asking if they may pay by installments. (for example http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.pigas.org&#x2f;pricing-medical-specialization&#x2f; )<p>now we have a problem, how can we build a system that we can collect money from a user even if they cancel their subscription.<p>note that it&#x27;s like buying a computer and paying for it monthly. you can&#x27;t give it back or cancel your subscription till the whole payment is done.<p>we&#x27;re using stripe and paypal payment methods on our website. is there any way to collect money from the clients even if they cancel their subscription?<p>i&#x27;m from germany and collecting money here isn&#x27;t a problem, we can just send an invoice and collect money. but most of our clients are in other countries so i think we can collect only by credit cards, but i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible somehow to collect money even the owner tries to bypass us.<p>i know some companies do it. for example car rent companies in germany, before renting a car they need just a credit card, they don&#x27;t accept cash or wire transfer. they do it because after giving the car back, they examine the car and if something is damaged, or even it&#x27;s dirty, they collect money from the credit card that provided at first day. but how can we do it for our online business?	2014-12-22 18:33:38 UTC		3

2)      clear about our features and benefits?
3)      usability: can you set up a sharing campaign quickly, is the campaign creation path easy to follow?

919671	who is hiring (remotely)?	there have previously been "who's hiring" type of posts. those attracted much attention and many people either found or changed their job thanks to those posts. however almost 100% of offers were for onsite work and most of them were in silicon valley.<p>there's world outside of silicon valley though. even outside of us. and it's a big world out there, with many talented people who just happen to live elsewhere.<p>i'm ruby on rails freelancer with 3.5+ year experience, living in poland. in a week or two i'm about to finish my current project and i'm looking for exciting opportunities. i believe <i>many, many</i> people are in similar position to mine so many companies and individuals could benefit from this.<p>so if there are companies (and i know there are many) who hire for remote positions, let's put it here and make good companies and talented people meet and work together.<p>as for me, i'm looking for an opportunity to work where not only coding is required. people too often think that developers should just pump out code. their creative or strategical input regarding the company is mostly disregarded, if at all taken into consideration.
i don't want to work <i>for</i> somebody. i want to work <i>with</i> somebody and make a difference.<p>so let's see all those opportunities for everybody who just cannot physically be where the most is happening.	2009-11-03 16:47:57 UTC		5

3768098	support for startups?	support for startups.<p>a friend and i were walking around the stanford last friday, and we were both doing some thinking about our lives, and where we want to go with them. after a while, the topic turned to maybe starting our own startup, the problem of course, is neither of us are software developers, nor are we particularly enamored with the idea of yet another photo sharing/social networking/whatever site we both feel all of those markets are very saturated.<p>we then looked at what both of us know well. support. both of us are top tier support folks - i have a background in field work, telecom support, and system administration, with a large side of customer/technical support as well as some sales engineer/project management stuff, he has a background in technical/customer support, with a strong side of technical documentation as well as a side of finance/business management.<p>so we got to thinking, what is missing in this market?<p>what about a company to provide customer support aimed at startups, empirically, there does seem to be a market - having your developers directly support customers is both inefficient and frustrating for everyone involved, beyond that, if your product is paid, you do really need real support, preferably being able to reach someone by phone. even if your product has no direct customer payment, if your product is complex enough, or used by enough people, you at least <i>should</i> have an email que, staffed by real people to get answers to the questions that cannot be covered by your faq.<p>both of us also have a large number of friends (read former co-workers) who could staff out such an enterprise, and i have enough telecom experience to get the basics of a contact center going. i've been looking at how to structure pricing, if for example you don’t want dedicated agents, we could just charge a per call amount to you, or for those who do want dedicated agents, a fixed monthly charge, plus a much smaller per call charge. beyond this, i have some ideas to give companies the benefits of traditional internal contact center folks, while still being able to have it managed at arms length.<p>so i suppose the question for hn are there startups looking for this service?	2012-03-28 20:10:43 UTC		5

8412711	ask hn: what to learn and where to focus your time and attention?	i a software engineer with 9 years  of experience, mostly in java&#x2f;python space.  recently i started learning c for fun.  i was beginning to enjoy it.  then someone claimed i need to know angularjs, so i tried that.  suddenly in an interview i was asked if i had ever read &#x27;clean code&#x27; book (which i hadn&#x27;t).  another friend said i should learn a cloud service for web  app hosting, so i delved into google app and compute engine.  my boss said android is hot and i should pick it up,  i immediately installed android studio and tried working on it.<p>now i feel stuck and in a quagmire.  i have a problem of attention deficit and this quandary is causing me lose sleep.  i am passionate about technology and don&#x27;t mind learning anything, literally anything.  but where to focus time and efforts is something i have never ever been able to figure out.  the result is that i know very little about a lot of things (very very little), but nothing substantial about almost anything.  this is driving me crazy.  any suggestions from anyone who faced this?	2014-10-05 16:54:05 UTC		8

i&#x27;ve owned reversegif.com for almost two years now. its an awesome app that lets you upload and reverse animated gifs. the site is by far the community favorite, and has been pulling in 400k uniques per month steadily for the last two years.<p>its serves such a niche purpose i don&#x27;t know where to take it from here. financially the site performs poorly - barely covering hosting  on a month to month basis. but i want to utilize the traffic and add more features that would bring the community value but i dont know where to go from here.<p>thoughts?	2013-10-21 22:12:45 UTC		9

2477877	ask hn: how would you architect around potential aws failures?	with the aws outages over the last few days, i've been wondering how you would set up a system using only aws services that would be resistant to multi-availability zone outages across multiple services within a geographical region.  assume that the system that we are setting up is an api that will have heavy read/write traffic with a significant number of users, and that the startup running it is on a typical shoestring budget that makes aws attractive.<p>what got a lot of startups in trouble was architecting systems that were fault-tolerant across availability zones within the us-east region, but when one availability zone went down, everybody's apps started flooding the other availability zones, causing more problems.  a typical setup might have been an elastic load balancer with ec2 instances in a few availability zones (with the ability to create new instances in other availability zones in response to outages), multi-az rds database servers, and s3 backups to multiple az's.<p>what i'm looking for is ideas for taking this setup and expanding it to multiple geographical regions, using only aws services.  would you have multiple stacks and use route 53 dns to route users to different regions?  how would you keep databases in sync across regions?  would you use one region as a primary and periodically back up to	2011-04-23 23:37:07 UTC		88

to give an obvious example of what i&#x27;m looking for- i would say, use margins to separate multiple instances of same components (among other uses). i wonder if there are books that deal with similar, but non-obvious topics.	2015-03-07 16:18:30 UTC		144

3381395	website relaunch feedback	i just relaunched a website after a complete redesign and translation of almost 10 years of bad asp code.  the original site goes back to 2000 and has been updated many times over the years but this current version contains the most dramatic changes.  i'm a fully operational/profitable accommodation booking company based in europe.  i'm not looking for advice on how to make "idea" work or compete with the big players, as we already have a niche following and are pretty highly respected in the travel world, but i haven't received loads of feedback about the new design, and the feedback i have received is from people who were familiar with the old site and are commenting mainly on how much better it is now.  i'd love to know what it looks like to an unfamiliar viewer and since i highly respect the hn readership i hoped to get some honest thoughts.  thanks in advance!<p>https://www.cross-pollinate.com	2011-12-22 13:10:59 UTC		1

8903743	ask hn: best over-ear headphones 2015	so this question has been discussed multiple times in many different forums. i&#x27;ve read tons of (often conflicting) advice and recommendations and i&#x27;m still none the wiser. i appreciate this is a subjective topic, and so no exhaustive ranking will ever exist. that said i know many of you will relate to my use case: i work as a software engineer in a shared office space, i want to listen to music whilst i work, i want some level of screening from background noise, be it a byproduct of good audio itself, or some form of passive&#x2f;active noise canceling. until recently i had a pair of bose qc15s which were revolutionary to me when i first tried them (likely because i&#x27;d never spent more than $50 on headphones). i would be tempted to go ahead and get the updated qc25 and think nothing more of it. i have read however that whilst the noise canceling is by far the best, some amount of audio quality is compromised as a result. i&#x27;m now leaning toward something more refined, that isn&#x27;t making such compromise. my problem is cutting down the myriad of options to a list i can actually attempt to compare myself. as such i&#x27;d love to try and get some consensus on the top five options (at least in terms of popularity) for the scenario i describe.<p>thank you all in advance!	2015-01-17 07:11:18 UTC		1

3951582	alternatives for mobile app analytics	does anyone have good suggestions for mobile application analytics (android and ios)?  the product i am working on is a library that gets integrated into existing applications.  as such our usage of analytics must coexist with separate unrelated analytics use in the app.<p>google analytics works well and the reporting interface is fairly easy to navigate and find out the information you want.  some parts of the interface are bizarre though.  they have two problems.  on android the library only supports one tracker instance and reporting so we can't report our events at the same time as the rest of the app reports its events.  the second is that for numerical values (custom variables) the only thing they report is the average value which is spectacularly useless.  i need to see the distribution of values.  talking to their support would appear to require forking out $150,000 a year before they will take the call.<p>i've also tried mixpanel but had numerous issues with their android library and server side.  it has no builtin reports so you have to compose queries yourself, and even simple slicing and dicing data is a pain.  i've had to write code to import all our data locally and then do analysis there to get reports like the pre-existing ones in google analytics.  (i've been unable to get any issue addressed by their support.)<p>there is a conflict of interest with flurry (in particular all the stuff they do other than analytics).<p>a solution hosted by someone else is preferable rather than self hosting due to the expected ramp up in volume of traffic.  searches turn up numerous analytics providers, but they all have web sites as their primary focus using a chunk of javascript as the library.  while there isn't that much difference in the events generated from a mobile app compared to a web site, there is a need for a robust android and ios library and for additional values to be tacked onto events, plus being able to use those values in reports and analysis.  we also need to be able to partition data so that third parties can look at a subset of it that belongs to their app.	2012-05-10 02:32:23 UTC		1

3295852	about cryptographic key recognition in data streams	abstract: search for cryptographic keys in ram is a new and prospective technology which can be used, primarily, in the computer forensics. in order to use it, a cryptanalyst must solve, at least, two problems: to create a memory dump from target machine and to distinguish target cryptographic keys from other data. the latter leads to a new mathematical task: &#60;&#60;recognition of cryptographic keys in the (random) data stream&#62;&#62;. the complexity of this task significantly depends on target cryptoalgorithm. for some algorithms (i.e. aes or serpent) this task is trivial but for other ones it may be very hard. in this work we present effective algorithms of expanded key recognition for blowfish and twofish. as far as we know this task for these algorithms has never been considered before.

2026297	ask hn:  marketing experiment	i've heard a couple different people mention blogs where they pay someone in the philippines to write content.  the blogs run adsense or something similar.  these don't bring in tons of money, but they are profitable if marketed well.<p>a friend and i found this a little ridiculous.  we wanted to give it a shot.  1) it would improve our marketing skills, and 2) it would make an interesting story.  we wanted the site to be relatively worthless, content-wise, but still be able to gather a following.<p>we came up with an idea that wasn't completely worthless though.  our blog is music recommendation service, focusing on good songs to wake up to in the morning.  revenue would be through affiliate advertising for the songs and adsense.<p>we launched our blog, wakeuptomusic.com, about 2 weeks ago and we have really struggled to attract a following.  we've focused mainly on using social media to attract followers, which hasn't brought a lot of traffic so far.<p>i wanted to ask the hn community for any ideas you might have on how to market something like this.  we're looking at some interesting ideas with twitter, like a itunes giftcard raffle, crowdsourcing posts (the post will be the top tweets about the song, instead of one we right ourselves), etc.<p>what are some standard practices in marketing a blog like this?  what are some crazy left field ideas that might work?  this is above all an experiment and an exercise, where we have an uphill battle marketing a semi-useless blog.<p>thanks!	2010-12-20 23:56:18 UTC		2

7982331	what if you could profit from your posts in social media?	hi all!<p>me and my team are working on a web player that allows people to tag their products in photos and videos they post on social media. we&#x27;re introducing a brand for the action sports market, featuring sponsored athletes that already generate thousands of views on their posts, resulting in tons of traffic for their brands&#x27; websites.<p>the idea is simple: the athlete (or a regular user) adds the products featuring in the shared content through our technology and they become available for purchase next to the photo or video within the player (it looks just like a facebook post). if you start getting lots of views on your posts, probably you&#x27;ll be contacted by one or more brands featuring with good news.<p>this is the overall picture. now a question: as an end user, would you upload your stuff and add product tags for share on a ppc model plus a chance of getting sponsored by one of those brands, or would you need a stronger incentive?<p>tips and feedback are highly welcomed! :)<p>fyi: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.radlegacy.com	2014-07-03 10:41:27 UTC		2

3315108	ask hn: any finance topics you're interesting in learning about?	background: my co-founder and i are in the process of preparing to launch a business around financial modeling software that we've built.  we discussed the idea of writing a book (or a series of articles) that we could give away for free on finance topics (e.g., cash flows, accounting, budgeting, npv modeling, etc.).  this would hopefully allow us to 1) provide a generally useful document to anyone who downloads it and 2) demonstrate the capabilities of our software.  i've come up with a list of topics that i plan on writing about, but thought maybe i could get some ideas from hn readers to augment my own.<p>so, are there any topics that you are interested in reading about / learning about related to finance?<p>also (on a separate, but related note): once finished with the book/articles, is it appropriate to submit it to hn?  that is, i hope (and expect) that it will be useful to anyone even if they don't use our software, but obviously one of the primary goals would be to help sell software too.<p>thanks for your feedback!	2011-12-05 16:04:41 UTC		2

   the goal of anythingbutipad is to be the best one-stop-shop source for finding and comparing all tablets that are competitors to the ipad. this site has the potential to drive the non-ipad tablet market.
   i simply lack the time to develop and market this site seriously. i would really appreciate it if a gadget-crazy blogger bought this instead of someone who just wants to make money. thats why this post on hackernews.<p>http://flippa.com/auctions/108999<p>please vote this post up.

3777131	show hn: pigeonal.com, a read-only email app	appcoast is a small collective of entrepreneurs and engineers, working on extensions for ebay and bespoke work for mozilla by day, and working on the next big thing by night. this week we launched our first commercial ios app.<p>pigeonal is an email client for iphone. its purpose is to quickly archive (and occasionally mark for follow-up) emails which only need a casual glance, or a quick check, before you file them away (examples: receipts, notifications, reminders).<p>the app scans your inbox for (currently) 207 different services and displays the results using icons in pigeonholes (a wood texture cupboard).<p>q: why only gmail and mobileme/icloud?
a: we'll roll out general support for imap, but it takes a lot of testing. imap is hairy.<p>q: can i flag/star an email for follow-up?
a: that will be possible in the next version, flagged email is currently moved to a follow-up folder (which also works great, both in gmail and mobileme, but some people prefer flagging/starring).<p>q: are you crazy? asking money for a read-only email client?
a: the read-only feature is a deliberate design choice: it prevents you from being sucked into an email conversation. we ask money for the app because we think it provides value for some people.<p>q: are you storing my email credentials on your servers?
a: no, your email account credentials are only stored on your phone using ios keychain and are only sent to gmail or mobileme/icloud.<p>http://www.pigeonal.com/	2012-03-30 17:37:34 UTC		4

2779614	ask hn: best way to show off job skills (how to build my resume online?)	throwaway due to coworkers being on here.<p>i've been realizing for awhile, that my current job situation is coming to an end, and i'm trying to think of ways to pursue my next opportunity. i've heard a lot about things like github (but have no experience with it), building examples/demos of tech you know (but can't think of what to build). the other downside, is that my resume looks unspectacular on paper (php/mysql developer, no degree, two years programming/one year as a job). but every job i've been at, whether it was a web job or not, i've always exceeded expectations and gone from an entry level type job, to leading a team of people in a fairly short time. i'm a fast learner and strive hard for the company i'm at, so  i guess i'm just trying to think of better ways to show people this.<p>`<p>skill set (in case you have ideas for demos i can build):<p>php (object oriented, design patterns, pdo library)<p>--kohana (built a few apps in it, but am by no means dependent on it. frequently read through the source)<p>mysql<p>javascript (the actual language, not just frameworks)<p>--jquery<p>--dojo (as well as dijit widgets and such)<p>objective-c (limited, just started learning and building basic apps like calculators and physics games)<p>python (even more limited, just enjoy the language and learning it. no web experience with python)<p>`<p>as an example, here's some stuff i did for  weekend projects to help my wife:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlflmqmbgc<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz9ftslef4m	2011-07-19 04:30:52 UTC		4
122540	ask yc: why are you guys obsessd with reddit?	as someone new to the site, i am confused at the level of animosity and obsession with reddit. was reddit once a bastion of intellectual conversation until one day the trolls came in and ravaged the entire site? is news.yc currently going down the tubes? i think whats important is that the focus and content here will keep a certain demographic of people away from this site. am i wrong?	2008-02-24 17:12:41 UTC		4
3606796	ask hn: looking for a quiet windows desktop	i know this isn't a typical 'ask hn' question, but i'm looking for recommendations for a very quiet windows desktop. a friend lives in a small studio apartment and must have his pc near his bed. the fan on his current pc is too loud. the usual search sources (i.e., google) yield too many useless results, so i thought i'd see if any fellow hn'ers have recommendations. this doesn't have to be the most powerful machine in the world ... it simply needs to run typical home user apps at a reasonable speed. thanks in advance.	2012-02-18 15:49:46 UTC		4

2989945	3 reasons not to choose bluehost	i debated about a few hosting companies to use for a local organization. bluehost seemed like a good option and i had worked with them before via other clients. they claim that they don't source anything and that their servers are fast and they limit them to 2000 users/sites per server.<p>however, i realized a few things after signing up with bluehost and wanting to get cracking on a new site:<p>1) they have to "verify" your account before you get access to ssh. don't do it if you're pressed for time.<p>2) you can't create addon domains and place them above the web root for the main site. this kind of sucks because you really don't want some stuff living inside of another site's web accessible files.<p>3) you have to "verify" addon domains which is a pain.<p>========================================================<p>here is the conversation, special attention to the last two lines :)<p>========================================================<p>gordon: [10:04:52 pm] thank you for contacting our support live chat! my name is gordon. if you haven't already provided your primary domain name and validation such as last 4 of the password or last 4 of the credit card, please do so now. also, please be patient as i am often on several different chats at once. thank you!<p>mark: [10:04:52 pm] i need ssh enabled for mysite.com<p>gordon: [10:05:15 pm] can i get the last 4 of the password please?<p>mark: [10:05:22 pm] abcd1<p>gordon: [10:06:23 pm] ok, i see here the account is not yet verified by our verification department. you will need to contact them tomorrow. they are not here right now since it is 10:06pm our time. then once it is verified, follow these directions<p>[10:06:29 pm] in order to enable ssh on your account, log in to the cpanel, go down to the security section, and click on the ssh/shell access. click on the manage ssh access button, and you will be able to select "ssh access enabled". the username is your 8-character cpanel username. the password is your cpanel password you use to log in to the cpanel.<p>mark: [10:12:13 pm] hmm<p>[10:12:19 pm] what do they have to do to verify the account<p>gordon: [10:13:17 pm] i think they just confirm the last 4 of the credit card and phone number and who you are to protect against fraud<p>mark: [10:13:45 pm] ok<p>[10:13:48 pm] one more question<p>[10:13:54 pm] im trying to add an addon domain<p>gordon: [10:14:12 pm] ok<p>[10:14:52 pm] do you get a message when you try to add it? do you already have the domain purchased elsewhere?<p>[10:15:11 pm] or were you trying to register it with us as a new domain?<p>mark: [10:15:19 pm] well two problems<p>gordon: [10:15:27 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:15:30 pm] first it asks me to verify the domain<p>[10:15:56 pm] you may also verify ownership of the domain "myaddonsite.com" by creating a page at http://myaddonsite.com/9d351b11.html or http://www.myaddonsite.com/9d351b11.html which contains the text "42688b8a" (retry assigning once the page has been created).<p>[10:16:03 pm] i created that file<p>gordon: [10:16:05 pm] yes<p>[10:16:07 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:16:13 pm] but it wont let me verify<p>gordon: [10:16:25 pm] hmm<p>[10:16:27 pm] let me try<p>mark: [10:17:11 pm] secondly it wants me to point the addon domain to public_html/myaddonsite.com/ but i dont want it inside the ~/public_html directory - i want it inside a different folder like ~/myaddonsite.com/public_html<p>[10:18:59 pm] it sucks that i can't get ssh access tonight. i wanted to rsync files to the server<p>gordon: [10:19:38 pm] there is not a way to have it outside of the public_html folder, the public_html folder is where all website related folders go so it would have to be something like public_html/whateverfolder<p>mark: [10:19:54 pm] ok can you help me cancel my account please<p>gordon: [10:19:54 pm] i am seeing if we can force add the domain on the account for you<p>mark: [10:20:09 pm] don't worry about that i just want to cancel<p>gordon: [10:20:15 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:20:15 pm] i'm going with a different hosting company<p>gordon: [10:21:21 pm] you would have to contact billing tomorrow during the time they are here or submit a ticket to them. i do not have a way to close the account for you.<p>mark: [10:21:43 pm] great. another reason to cancel. thanks<p>gordon: [10:22:58 pm] you are welcome. let us know if there is anything else	2011-09-13 04:31:19 UTC		8

it will be great if you will also share here your thoughts regarding to this poll. thanks, uria.	2015-04-02 07:50:12 UTC		9

2. i&#x27;m not a very good developer, so my code is not super clean

the reason we haven't started building yet is because we did not know how to code. we started going to hacker news and learning to code. we simply don't have the knowledge or the money to start yet. in 6 months we will.	2011-02-10 00:04:50 UTC		11

421885	ask yc: is an ipo alternative needed?	i've seen this idea going around for the past six months and i was curious about the feasibility/need for it. currently there are barriers for companies to reach ipo (sarbox, etc.) which in turn makes it much more difficult for a clean exit for early-stage investors.<p>so what has been suggested is to create a secondary market (see here: http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/08/a-secondary-mar.html) to help fill the widening gap between startup and ipo. this would in turn create some liquidity that would lead to less risk for founders and early investors.<p>clearly there are some legal risks in actually creating a market. the only people that could participate would be accredited investors, and there would be some muddling with the sec and possibly the ctfc.<p>i'm asking yc because the discussion doesn't seem to hit this demographic. what do you think?	2009-01-06 13:22:20 UTC		14

1357595	ask hn: review our app: masterbranch.com	hi hn
we would like to have some feedback about the app we are building.<p>masterbranch is a site which makes cvs for developers based on their real experience (open source by the moment). in a future there will be tools for people who haven't worked in open source. now we are focusing in supporting different forges and with time keep growing and giving support for more but we are also trying to polish what we already have.<p>we have few employers registered, and they think the service might be nice and useful, but we would like to know more about how other developers like us see the site, what they like, what they dislike... any feedback is welcome and appreciated  :)<p>our aim is to be useful for developers to get great and cool jobs and give employers a good tool for hiring talent and to reduce the hiring error in technical recruitment.<p>thank you for your kind attention<p>cheers	2010-05-18 14:44:07 UTC		15

379111	ask hn: boston or silicon valley?	so i'm graduating in may and have a couple of great offers from places in both boston and the valley.  i've interned in sv twice and love it.  this is both a pro and a con in that i know the place well, but at the same time i'd love to try some place different and diversify a little.  i intend to start a business at some point in the future, and as such imagine i'll eventually move to sv.  here's my pro-con list:<p><pre><code>  sv pros:
  - gorgeous weather
  - amazing networking opportunities

  boston pros:
  - closer to home (i'm from ny)
  - cheaper
  - more diverse (less disjoint with reality)
</code></pre>
before i start a flame war over my last boston pro: while i love the valley, i sometimes feel like it's disjoint with reality in terms of how people act towards technology.  it's a nerd's haven and often awesome, but mildly unnerving at times and lacks some diversity.<p>anyway, i'd appreciate some advice as to where to go given equal offers (factoring in cost of living to a reasonable extent).  additionally i'd like some clarification on a few things to help make a more informed decision:<p>- is boston significantly cheaper than sv (i'd probably be in the mountain view area)?  it's hard to find comparable areas for cost of apartments and such.<p>- what's the startup scene like in boston?  i hear it's a great place for a software startup, but how does it compare to the valley in terms of opportunities and networking?<p>- any advice on which of two hypothetical is better: big fish little pond or little fish big pond?  alternatively, would you rather be at an important team in a lesser-known company, or a less-important team in a well-known company?<p>- any other factors i should be taking into account?  i'm looking closely at what i'd be doing, what my potential employers' non-competes look like, and how open the companies are.  one company is a private open-source company, and the other is a company of about the same size owned by a public company.<p>this is a really tough decision, and any advice would be really appreciated.<p>thanks!	2008-11-28 05:14:23 UTC		22

for those interested, mixcloud is an online audio hosting platform, focusing on long form audio. this initial launch covers basic site interaction (favorite/follow) and all our meta data. the api authenticated is oauth2 and json(p)/xml endpoints are provided.	2010-08-05 12:17:00 UTC		43

1373076	ask hn: how valuable to my resume is 5 years at microsoft?	there have been some interesting discussions here and on quora (http://www.quora.com/what-companies-teams-are-toxic-on-a-resume) about certain companies not being good for your resume or two much time at one of these companies not being good for your resume.<p>i have no college education so when i first started at microsoft when i was 22 i decided that i wanted to work there for 5 years and do well (best reviews possible, multiple promotions).  i also wanted to spend the time trying to influence microsoft as an organization to do something interesting in the linked data/semantic web space.  i am now a senior engineer and have pioneered the use of data semantics within bing. this experience feels extremely valuable as i pursue a longer career working with start-ups.<p>i am confident that i will complete my 5 years and meet my goals but i'm interested in better understanding how this experience will be perceived by members of the start-up community that i hope to be a part of in the future.<p>is it really perceived as a negative to work at an engineering organization like microsoft? what other things will be valuable to demonstrate on my resume as i look to enter the hacker community more actively?	2010-05-23 21:30:56 UTC		43

2228268	show hn: a user powered copy editing tool (running on ars technica)	i blew off a bunch of "serious" side work last month and built a tiny little embeddable editing tool that i've wanted to have for ars technica since, well, the beginning of internet time. it lets any random user make edit suggestions for writers/editors to consider and act on. <i>i</i> think it's pretty cool and it's gotten some good use over the last few weeks.<p>of note, it's uses a single-field signup form. edit administration is currently email based, so all it needs is an email address to get people going.<p>i'm sure i'm not the only person to ever do this, but i basically just turned it on one night even though i sort of hated the state it was in. that turned out to be a good call because people started using it almost immediately, which is both flattering and educational. it's making it a little bit harder to drastically change things (since i suddenly have legacy problems), but it was totally worth it.<p>check it out: https://copypasta.credibl.es	2011-02-16 20:59:52 UTC		56

4166183	a day in the life of a startup founder	(the following is parody of recent posts, it is not meant as criticism of any individual but as commentary on what i see as an unhealthy obsession with the habits of others and of people taking themselves and others in the 'startup community' a bit too seriously)<p>0523 alarm sounds on my iphone 4gs.  i don't use just any alarm program: i use biorythym alarm system+ which monitors my internal body clock and starts ringing at the appropriate time before 0523 to begin an in tune start to the day.  it uses gregorian chants, nature sounds and recordings from inside the womb to ease me into the day.<p>0530 i'm in front of my macbook air (with 256gb ssd) at my desk made from recycled lumber from south african railway tracks.  why did i get up 7 minutes earlier?  because, as manic minute minder pro reminds me 7 minutes wasted per day 1.7 extra days of productive time per year. 1.7 days when the competition is literally sleeping!<p>i drink a large bowl of jing tea matcha supreme green and a glass of organic milk.  at 0533 every day i'm hacking through my email, todos, tweets and catching up on hacker news.  every 20 minutes time out reminds me to stop, meditate and focus.<p>0645 i walk into my bedroom with a green tea for my wife cassiopeia who is waking up.  we smile at each other and spend the next 15 minutes on one on one time.  at 0700 it's time to wake our two boys: dagwood and spaniel.<p>0800 the house is quiet but skype isn't. i stay in contact with my teams in costa rica, montreal and goa via skype throughout the day.  this morning check in with the teams gives me a good view of where the business is.  currently we're in double stealth mode (the public doesn't know what we're building and neither do we).<p>0830 i jog down to the ground floor of our new york brownstone and get on my trek madone 4 series bike for a 30 mile ride out into new jersey and back.  my iphone 4gs is cued up with a set of daily business podcasts set to run at double speed so i can get through all of them in the hour's ride.<p>0930 shower and then spiritual time.  i have a small shrine set up that allows me to focus on the important.  i light an incense and gaze up at posters of tim ferriss, kevin rose and warren buffet.<p>0945 the day really begins.  for here on in it's meetings, hirings, firings, networking with the new york vc and angel crowd until 1900 when c, d &#38; s (or cease and desist as i call them) come back home.  we eat together and at 2200 i'm in bed with a light cucumber mask and the alarm set for another day.<p>tonight's a little special because i've been invited to give a one hour keynote on being a startup ceo at velocipede ventures weekly pumped and primed meetup for other successful entrepreneurs like me.	2012-06-27 09:12:00 UTC		633

9450587	run goldy, run new highly addictive game with 10% proceeds going to charity	hey guys, i want to invite you to check out my new game, run goldy, run! it&#x27;s basically a 2d sidescroller based on dodging a never ending onslaught of enemies, with the twist of being able to run on the top or the bottom of the floor. it sounds confusing, but it&#x27;s completely intuitive once you get into it. there&#x27;s two basic controls, flip and shoot, blending the simplicity of games like flappy bird with the insane difficulty of...also flappy bird. it tells the simple story of a sheep with golden fleece who was born to run, and the eternal swarm of enemies who will stop at nothing to claim his precious pelt. anyway, it&#x27;s my first major game release and i&#x27;d really like to invite all of you to check it out on the appstore or my website, goldythesheep.com.<p>given that it&#x27;s my first real project and i have little to no experiencing designing games, i&#x27;m not anticipating to make a huge wad of cash off of it. however, 10% of whatever i do make off of content ads will be donated to charity, specifically children&#x27;s hospital in dallas. i&#x27;m a guy who likes to play games, and i made a game that i hope you will enjoy playing, but if that doesn&#x27;t grab you, you can also help the disadvantaged. that&#x27;s right, you can play an awesome game, support a budding indie studio, and help the poor, all at the same time!<p>so again, try it out, let me know what you think, and if you enjoy, please share. have a good run!

use the same hostname for both! 
that way, you save a dns lookup to your nameserver and enjoy the extra reliability of a large tld nameserver infrastructure.	2014-05-25 08:50:29 UTC		1

3343884	ask hn: is fsbackup good?	hi,
i was recently suggested to use fsbackup together with amazon aws for my dedicated server offiste backup.

2672927	how does your surrounding  community impact the hacker zeitgeist?	pg has stated that while intelligence is hard to fake that determination is something where discernment of it is far more difficult to achieve correctly.<p>he's also emphasized the key role this plays in predicting success. coining terms such as "relentlessly resourceful" and emphasizing constant and responsive iteration as a great key to success. all this has accentuated in my mind the impact that a cultures ethics/morals play in fostering entrepreneurial activity/success.<p>this ranges the gamut from honesty to thrift and security as all being elements that can impact a culture or communities start-up mojo.<p>take, for example, my home of utah. lots of tech savvy entrepreneurial minded folks. yet, in my opinion, a hyper zealous thrift minded risk averse upper/upper middle class contributes (along with other factors i could name) to the problem of things like seed funding. people want to invest but their sensibilities keep them often from engaging in seed funding much of anything. (most ideas of "seed funding" here seem to demand an already in the marketplace profit gaining gig)<p>so my question to you, where ever you are, is<p>"what are aspects of your community that you believe impact the entrepreneurial spirit/fostering of innovation?"	2011-06-20 04:53:29 UTC		1

3701504	ask hn: go with what i got, stay the course, or learning the wrong stuff?	i got into startups as a sole 'business founder'.  even back then, those were slimey words to say to a coder, so i started writing, what i now know was bad, php in order to have something to show and convince real developers i wasn't another 'biz' guy w/o a clue and get them to join my team (for no money).  and it worked.<p>i've worked on my own startup projects for a few years full-time, building quick and dirty front-end mockups, wire-frames and writing middle-ware that needed to get done, to hit deadlines; while doing the biz dev, sales, customer dev, etc.<p>after a few years, a few projects, a lot of project management of small / agile teams and tons of customer development, product development and product marketing, i haven't made it on my own.  but, at best, i've become an okay, but unsuccessful startup founder.  turns out that while lots of startups claim they want entrepreneurial people, after working for an early stage startup, turns out that i make a better co-founder than 1st employee.<p>i'm trying to figure out what to do next and i've started teaching myself how to really code.  i gave up os x and windows, and am going cold turkey to ubuntu.  with that, i've been coding exclusively on vim (which is amazing &#38; amazingly complex) and learning to use an mvc, the right way.  but, i'm still coding in php (when i feel like i should be learning python).  coding is something i've always enjoyed, but i figured i should get better at it.<p>i've always been interested and really enjoy coding / building stuff.  however, am i wasting my time trying to build up my skills to get a job as a coder?  honestly, i'm not sure if i'm currently so low after my startup experience, that i'm pre-maturely giving up on using my product &#38; startup skills to get a job at either another startup or large company.<p>advice?	2012-03-14 02:20:56 UTC		1

879390	don't be evil? google's mobile services in africa.	a recent article in the economist discusses several mobile services in africa, including google trader, "a text-based system that matches buyers and sellers of agricultural produce and commodities [in uganda]. sellers send a message to say where they are and what they have to offer, which will be available to potential buyers within 30km for seven days... these services cost 110 shillings ($0.05) a time, the same as a standard text message, except for google trader, which costs double that. in their first five weeks the services received a total of more than 1m queries."

9288786	could you survive germanwings 4u9525 by jumping out?	would it at all be possible to survive germanwings 4u9525 by opening the door and jumping out at the optimal* point of its decent?<p>some things to consider:<p>1) if a passenger had a parachute, does this make a difference?<p>2) what would be the best altitude for jumping out? i presume above a certain height the air pressure inside the cabin would be too great relative to the outside pressure to actually open the door.<p>3) the wind speeds going across the door would be 700km&#x2f;h. can a human even jump into such a force without being torn into pieces?<p>4) obviously without a parachute, the best we can hope for is slowing down from 700km&#x2f;h to terminal velocity. some people have survived terminal velocity falls so this might be worthwhile.<p>5) any other scenarios i have not considered?<p>*not sure what the optimal would be, if any.	2015-03-30 11:23:46 UTC		1

92223	anyone can bootstrap a startup to riches ... how about this one?	when writing about the success and failure of startups, i talked a lot about luck being the most important contributing factor to the success of any startup, but i also talked about the importance of being a "surrogate customer". in other words, if you can identify a problem that you personally experience but currently has no solution, and if you can be passionate about it and fundamentally believe that it is an industry-wide problem that affects a sizable community, then you have identified the cornerstone you need to build a company.<p>the problem that i have identified is one where i want to find potential customers, customers who have never heard of us and could never find us on their own. and the only solution available to me (pr firms and conventional media) is inherently "channel-inefficient". so what do i do ... i do the only thing that entrepreneurs know how to do which is to force a paradigm shift. the new paradigm is an innovative marketing channel and it is called lovemytool.<p>lovemytool is all about "advocacy marketing".<p>lovemytool does not post press releases nor marketing collaterals. instead we post only customer testimonials and technical reviews by third parties (i.e., advocates who "love" their tools and are passionate about our industry).	2007-12-23 17:45:48 UTC	http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/2007/12/advocacy.html	2

linkedin&#x27;s self-service ads don&#x27;t require a salesperson. you can create targeted ads, set a budget, bid, and pay with a credit card directly from your computer.<p>for budgets of $25,000 and above, contact us about display advertising.<p>same story with skype, try contacting skype. i once spent an hour finding their phone number and i gave up.<p>technological advances killing jobs at an amazing rate but it seems that unwillingness to make their services more customer friendly is also one of the causes.	2013-07-09 19:32:16 UTC		2

3734698	groupon (netherlands) accused of spamming links	groupon is in the netherlands accused of organized spamming of links. they hired some students and let them register on dozens of internet forums where they act as normal users who are there to introduce themselves and later on just go with the flow, while subtly inserting links to groupon.nl in their comments.<p>groupon even thought it was okay to spam on a forum that is created specifically for people who suffer of multiple sclerosis. groupon still have to give an official statement, but in their first reactions they say that they did not hire any students and that they know nothing about the link spam. althought, some zealous forum members of the forum higherlevel.nl discovered that all those spam accounts can be traced to groupon.<p>i’m curious about what will happen next. first i’m curious of what groupon really will have to say about this, and further more what google may do, if they discover that groupon is spamming links to improve their seo results. and last but not least, maybe groupon will get some pretty big penalties (a maximum of 450.000 euros (600k dollars) per violation) of the dutch consumers authority.<p>( dutch source: http://www.higherlevel.nl/forum/index.php?board=40;action=display;threadid=41332 )	2012-03-21 15:07:07 UTC		2

992288	ask hn: how do i get a lot of voters for my video contest entry?	i made a video commercial and entered a contest with a prize of $25,000. my video was selected for the top 10, out of 700 submissions. the winner is chosen by public voting on youtube.<p>i'm facing contestants who are not playing by the rules; they are offering prizes in exchange for votes and that has left my video trailing far behind.<p>how can i reach a very wide audience in the next few days before the contest ends?<p>here's what i've done so far:
- advertised on facebook, myspace, and every social site there is
- posted on craigslist
- thought of donating part of the money to charity (and still considering it)
- tried to find a famous twitter-er to post for me
- ate a ton of pistachios for inspiration<p>to see the video, go to http://www.youtube.com/loftylizard.	2009-12-13 02:39:26 UTC		2

970749	why i may be going back to incandescent light bulbs	i'm considering going back to incandescent light bulbs, even though this will mean my energy bills will go up, and i'm wondering if anyone else is seeing the same thing as i am:<p>at our house we have had cf bulbs for something over five years. we have now had three incidents of bulbs spontaneously cracking open at the end of their life. why is this a problem? mercury exposure. i have no idea how much mercury we have inhaled since this began. we have also had some bulbs die without obvious cracking [edit: and i wonder if maybe they have leaked too, since i wasn't looking for the problem until now], but the most recent bulb to die did so while i was in the room, and i noticed it happening, so i got to see what was going on.<p>the bulb was flickering and the gas at the base of the tubes (where they enter the body of the screw-on portion) was turning orange. i decided to remove the bulb before it had a chance to break. very shortly, in the few seconds it took me to remove the bulb, the bulb started heating up. at first it wasn't even warm to the touch, and ten seconds later it was so hot i was starting to wonder if i would get it out in time to not need a glove or cloth. at that point i turned off the power (should have done that to start with) and noticed acrid plastic-smelling smoke coming out near the base of the tubes.<p>i'm guessing some sort of plastic or epoxy/resin material is used to seal the tubes at the base, and this was melting. and the next step, had i not been there to catch and prevent it, would have been the heating of the glass to the point where it broke.<p>i'm not really super thrilled about myself or my children breathing mercury vapors repeatedly as the light bulbs in my house expire one after the other over the years.<p>question for hn: has anyone else seen this? since these bulbs are supposed to last for seven years, maybe it's a hidden problem until now? i was hoping led lights would be the solution, but they are so dim they don't really act as an adequate substitute.<p>tl;dr: upon aging, my cf bulbs have been cracking open, presumably releasing mercury vapors into my house. with 50+ light bulbs in the house, i'm concerned about this and wonder if others see it too.	2009-12-01 21:04:30 UTC		2

1804743	charlie munger: turning $2 million into $2 trillion 	via appendix d in damn right: behind the scenes with berkshire hathaway billionaire charlie munger<p>it is 1884 in atlanta. you are brought, along with twenty others like you, before a rich and eccentric atlanta citizen named glotz. both you and glotz share two characteristics: first, you routinely use in problem solving the five helpful notions, and, second, you know all the elementary ideas in all the basic college courses, as taught in 1996. however, all discoverers and all examples demonstrating these elementary ideas come from dates transposed back before 1884. neither you nor glotz knows anything about anything that has happened after 1884.
glotz offers to invest $2 million, yet take only half the equity, for a glotz charitable foundation, in a new corporation organized to go into the non-alcoholic beverage business and remain in that business only, forever. glotz wants to use a name that has somehow charmed him: coca-cola.<p>the other half of the new corporation’s equity will go to the man who most plausibly demonstrates that his business plan will cause glotz’s foundation to be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the money of that later time, 2034, despite paying out a large part of its earnings each year as a dividend. this will make the whole new corporation worth $2 trillion, even after paying out many billions of dollars in dividends.<p>you have fifteen minutes to make your pitch. what do you say to glotz?<p>and here is my solution, my pitch to glotz, using only the helpful notions and what every bright college sophomore should know.<p>well glotz, the big “no-brainer” decisions that, to simplify our problem, should be made first are as follows: first, we are never going to create something worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. therefore we must make your name, “coca-cola,” into a strong, legally protected trademark. second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in atlanta, then succeeding in the rest of the united states, then rapidly succeeding with our new beverage all over the world. this will require developing a product having universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental forces. and the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is in the subject matter of elementary academic courses.<p>we will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target implies. we can guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be about eight billion beverage consumers around the world. on average, each of these consumers will be much more prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884. each consumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about 64 ounces of water per day. this is eight eight-ounce servings. thus, if our new beverage, and other imitative beverages in our new market, can flavor and otherwise improve only 25 percent of ingested water worldwide, and we can occupy half of the new world market, we can sell 2.92 trillion eight-ounce servings in 2034. and if we can then net four cents per serving, we will earn $117 billion. this will be enough, if our business is still growing at a good rate, to make it easily worth two trillion dollars.<p>a big question, of course, is whether four cents per serving is a reasonable profit target for 2034. and the answer is yes, if we can create a beverage with strong universal appeal. one hundred fifty years is a long time. the dollar, like the roman drachma, will almost surely suffer monetary depreciation. concurrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage consumer in the world will go way up. his proclivity to inexpensively improve his experience while ingesting water will go up considerably faster. meanwhile, as technology improves, the cost of our simple product, in units of constant purchasing power, will go down. all four factors will work together in favor of our four-cents-per-serving profit target. worldwide beverage-purchasing power in dollars will probably multiply by a factor of at least forty over 150 years. thinking in reverse, this makes our profit-per-serving target, under 1884 conditions, a mere one fortieth of four cents or one tenth of a cent per serving. this is an easy-to-exceed target as we start out if our new product has universal appeal.<p>that decided, we must next solve the problem of invention to create universal appeal. there are two intertwined challenges of large scale: first, over 150 years we must cause a new-beverage market to assimilate about one fourth of the world’s water ingestion. second, we must so operate that half the new market is ours, while all our competitors combined are left to share the remaining half. these results are lollapalooza results. accordingly, we must attack our problem by causing every favorable factor we can think of to work for us. plainly, only a powerful combination of many factors is likely to cause the lollapalooza consequences we desire. fortunately, the solution to these intertwined problems turns out to be fairly easy, if one has stayed awake in all the freshman courses.<p>let us start by exploring the consequences of our simplifying “no-brainer” decision that we must rely on a strong trademark. this conclusion automatically leads to an understanding of the essence of our business in proper elementary academic terms. we can see from the introductory course in psychology that, in essence, we are going into the business of creating and maintaining conditioned reflexes. the “coca-cola” trade name and trade dress will act as the stimuli, and the purchase and ingestion of our beverage will be the desired responses.<p>and how does one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? well, the psychology text gives two answers: by operant conditioning, and (2) by classical conditioning, often called pavlovian conditioning to honor the great russian scientist. and, since we want a lollapalooza result, we must use both conditioning techniques – and all we can invent to enhance effects from each technique.<p>the operant-conditioning part of our problem is easy to solve. we need only (1) maximize rewards of our beverage’s ingestion, and (2) minimize possibilities that desired reflexes, once created by us, will be extinguished through operant conditioning by proprietors of competing products.<p>for operant conditioning rewards, there are only a few categories we will find practical:<p>food value in calories or other inputs;
flavor, texture, and aroma acting as stimuli to consumption under neural preprogramming of a man through darwinian natural selection;
stimulus, as by sugar or caffeine;
cooling effect when man is too hot or warming effect when man is too cool.
wanting a lollapalooza result, we will naturally include rewards in all the categories.
to start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for consumption cold. there is much less opportunity, without ingesting beverage, to counteract excessive heat, compared with excessive cold. moreover, with excessive heat, much liquid must be consumed, and the reverse is not true. it is also easy to decide to include both sugar and caffeine. after all, tea, coffee, and lemonade are already widely consumed. and it is also clear that we must be fanatic about determining, through trial and error, flavor and other characteristics that will maximize human pleasure while taking in the sugared water and caffeine we will provide. and, to counteract possibilities that desired operant-conditioned reflexes, once created by us will be extinguished by operant conditioning employing competing products, there is also an obvious answer: we will make it a permanent obsession in our company that our beverage, as fast as practicable, will at all times be available everywhere throughout the world. after all, a competing product, if it is never tried, can’t act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. every spouse knows that.<p>we must next consider the pavlovian conditioning we must also use. in pavlovian conditioning powerful effects come from mere association. the neural system of pavlov’s dog causes it to salivate at the bell it can’t eat. and the brain of man yearns for the type of beverage held by the pretty woman he can’t have. and so, glotz, we must use every sort of decent, honorable pavlovian conditioning we can think of. for as long as we are in business, our beverage and its promotion must be associated in consumer minds with all other thing consumers like or admire.<p>such extensive pavlovian conditioning will cost a lot of money, particularly for advertising. we will spend big money as far ahead as we can imagine. but the money will be effectively spent. as we expand fast in our new-beverage market, our competitors will face gross disadvantages of scale in buying advertising to create the pavlovian conditioning they need. and this outcome, along with other volume-creates-power effects, should help us gain and hold at least 50 percent of the new market everywhere. indeed, provided buyers are scattered, our higher volumes will give us very extreme cost advantages in distribution.<p>moreover, pavlovian effects from mere association will help us choose the flavor, texture, and color of our new beverage. considering pavlovian effects, we will have wisely chosen the exotic and expensive-sounding name “coca-cola,” instead of a pedestrian name like “glotz’s sugared, caffeinated water.” for similar pavlovian reasons, it will be wise to have our beverage look pretty much like wine, instead of sugared water. and so we will artificially color our beverage if it comes out clear. and we will carbonate our water, making our product seem like champagne, or some other expensive beverage, while also making its flavor better and imitation harder to arrange for competing products. and, because we are going to attach so many expensive psychological effects to our flavor, that flavor should be different from any other standard flavor so that we maximize difficulties for competitors and give no accidental same-flavor benefit to any existing product.<p>what else, from the psychology textbook, can help our new business? well, there is that powerful “monkey-see, monkey-do” aspect of human nature that psychologists often call “social proof.” social proof, imitative consumption triggered by mere sight of consumption, will not only help induce trial of our beverage. it will also bolster perceived rewards from consumption. we will always take this powerful social-proof factor into account as we design advertising and sales promotion and as we forego present profit to enhance present and future consumption. more than with most other products, increased selling power will come from each increase in sales.<p>we can now see, glotz, that by combining (1) much pavlovian conditioning, (2) powerful social-proof effects, and (3) wonderful-tasting, energy-giving, stimulating and desirably-cold beverage that causes much operant conditioning, we are going to get sales that speed up for a long time by reason of the huge mixture of factors we have chosen. therefore, we are going to start something like an autocatalytic reaction in chemistry, precisely the sort of multi-factor-triggered lollapalooza effect we need.<p>the logistics and the distribution strategy of our business will be simple. there are only two practical ways to sell our beverage: (1) as a syrup to fountains and restaurants, and (2) as a complete carbonated-water product in containers. wanting lollapalooza results, we will naturally do it both ways. and, wanting huge pavlovian and social-proof effects we will always spend on advertising and sales promotion, per serving, over 40 percent of the fountain price for syrup needed to make the serving.<p>a few syrup-making plants can serve the world. however, to avoid needless shipping of mere space and water, we will need many bottling plants scattered over the world. we will maximize profits if (like early general electric with light bulbs) we always set the first-sale price, either (1) for fountain syrup, or (2) for any container of our complete product. the best way to arrange this desirable profit-maximizing control is to make any independent bottler we need a subcontractor, not a vendee of syrup, and certainly not a vendee of syrup under a perpetual franchise specifying a syrup price frozen forever at its starting level.<p>being unable to get a patent or copyright on our super important flavor, we will work obsessively to keep our formula secret. we will make a big hoopla over our secrecy, which will enhance pavlovian effects. eventually food-chemical engineering will advance so that our flavor can be copied with near exactitude. but, by that time, we will be so far ahead, with such strong trademarks and complete, “always available” worldwide distribution, that good flavor copying won’t bar us from our objective. moreover, the advances in food chemistry that help competitors will almost surely be accompanied by technological advances that will help us, including refrigeration, better transportation, and, for dieters, ability to insert a sugar taste without inserting sugar’s calories. also, there will be related beverage opportunities we will seize.<p>this brings us to a final reality check for our business plan. we will, once more, think in reverse like jacobi. what must we avoid because we don’t want it? four answers seem clear:<p>first, we must avoid the protective, cloying, stop-consumption effects of aftertaste that are a standard part of physiology, developed through darwinian evolution to enhance the replication of man’s genes by forcing a generally helpful moderation on the gene carrier. to serve our ends, on hot days a consumer must be able to drink container after container of our product with almost no impediment from aftertaste. we will find a wonderful no-aftertaste flavor by trial and error and will thereby solve this problem.<p>second, we must avoid ever losing even half of our powerful trademarked name. it will cost us mightily, for instance, if our sloppiness should ever allow sale of any other kind of “cola,” for instance, a “peppy cola.” if there is ever a “peppy cola,” we will be the proprietor of the brand.<p>third, with so much success coming, we must avoid bad effects from envy, given a prominent place in the ten commandments because envy is so much a part of human nature. the best way to avoid envy, recognized by aristotle, is to plainly deserve the success we get. we will be fanatic about product quality, quality of product presentation, and reasonableness of prices, considering the harmless pleasure it will provide.<p>fourth, after our trademarked flavor dominates our new market, we must avoid making any huge and sudden change in our flavor. even if a new flavor performs better in blind taste tests, changing to that new flavor would be a foolish thing to do. this follows because, under such conditions, our old flavor will be so entrenched in consumer preference by psychological effects that a big flavor change would do us little good. and it would do immense harm by triggering in consumers the standard deprival super-reaction syndrome that makes “take-aways” so hard to get in any type of negotiation and helps make most gamblers so irrational. moreover, such a large flavor change would allow a competitor, by copying our old flavor, to take advantage of both (1) the hostile consumer super-reaction to deprival and (2) the huge love of our original flavor created by our previous work.<p>well, that is my solution to my own problem of turning $2 million into $2 trillion, even after paying out billions of dollars in dividends. i think it would have won with glotz in 1884 and should convince you more than you expected at the outset. after all, the correct strategies are clear after being related to elementary academic ideas brought into play by the helpful notions.<p>how consistent is my solution with the history of the real coca-cola company? well, as late as 1896, twelve years after the fictional glotz was to start vigorously with $2 million, the real coca-cola company had a net worth under $150 thousand and earnings of about zero. and thereafter the real coca-cola company did lose half its trademark and did grant perpetual bottling franchises at fixed syrup prices. and some of the bottlers were not very effective and couldn’t easily be changed. and the real coca-cola company, with this system, did lose much pricing control that would have improved results, had it been retained. yet, even so, the real coca-cola company followed so much of the plan given to glotz that it is now worth about $125 billion and will have to increase its value at only 8 percent per year until 2034 to reach a value of $2 trillion. and it can hit an annual physical volume target of 2.92 trillion servings if servings grow until 2034 at only 6 percent per year, a result consistent with much past experience and leaving plenty of plain-water ingestion for coca-cola to replace after 2034. so i would guess that the fictional glotz, starting earlier and stronger and avoiding the worst errors, would have easily hit his $2 trillion target. and he would have done it well before 2034.<p>this brings me, at last, to the main purpose of my talk. large educational implications exist, if my answer to glotz’s problem is roughly right and you make one more assumption i believe true – that most ph.d. educators, even psychology professors and business school deans, would not have given the same simple answer i did. and, if i am right in these two ways, this would indicate that our civilization now keeps in place a great many educators who can’t satisfactorily explain coca-cola, even in retrospect, and even after watching it closely all their lives. this is not a satisfactory state of affairs.<p>moreover – and this result is even more extreme – the brilliant and effect executives who, surrounded by business school and law school graduates, have run the coca-cola company with glorious success in recent years, also did not understand elementary psychology well enough to predict and avoid the “new coke” fiasco, which dangerously threatened their company. that people so talented, surrounded by professional advisers from the best universities, should thus demonstrate a huge gap in their education is also not a satisfactory state of affairs.<p>such extreme ignorance, in both the high reaches of academia and the high reaches of business, is a lollapalooza effect of a negative sort, demonstrating grave defects in academia. because the bad effect is a lollapalooza, we should expect to find intertwined, multiple academic causes. i suspect at least two such causes.<p>first, academic psychology, while it is admirable and useful as a list of ingenious and important experiments, lacks intradisciplinary synthesis. in particular, not enough attention is given to lollapalooza effects coming from combinations of psychological tendencies. this creates a situation reminding one of a rustic teacher who tries to simplify school work by rounding pi to an even three. and it violates einstein’s injunction that “everything should be made as simple as possible – but no more simple.” in general, psychology is laid out and misunderstood as electromagnetism would now be misunderstood if physics had produced many brilliant experimenters like michael faraday and no grand synthesizer like james clerk maxwell.<p>and, second, there is a truly horrible lack of synthesis blending psychology and other academic subjects. but only an interdisciplinary approach will correctly deal with reality – in academia as with the coca-cola company.<p>in short, academic psychology departments are immensely more important and useful than other academic departments think. and, at the same time, the psychology departments are immensely worse than more of their inhabitants think. it is, of course, normal for self-appraisal to be more positive than external appraisal. indeed, a problem of this sort may have given you your speaker today. but the size of this psychology-department gap is preposterously large. in fact, the gap is so enormous that one very eminent university (chicago) simply abolished its psychology department, perhaps with an undisclosed hope of later creating a better vision.<p>in such a state of affairs, many years ago and with much that was plainly wrong already present, the “new coke” fiasco occurred, wherein coke’s executives came to the brink of destroying the most valuable trademark in the world. the academically correct reaction to this immense and well-publicized fiasco would have been the sort of reaction boeing would display if three of its new airplanes crashed in a single week. after all, product integrity is involved in each case, and the plain educational failure was immense.<p>but almost no such responsible, boeing-like reaction has come from academia. instead academia, by and large, continues in its balkanized way to tolerate psychology professors who mis-teach psychology, non-psychology professors who fail to consider psychological effects obviously crucial in their subject matter, and professional schools that carefully preserve psychological ignorance coming in with each entering class and are proud of their inadequacies.	2010-10-18 19:17:55 UTC		3

i&#x27;ve been running printmosaic for a while (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.printmosaic.com) and i am now experimenting with contests.<p>printmosaic allows people to create photo mosaics easily. choose your main image then choose the small images and it assembles them for you. it is then possible to order a print or a high resolution image if you want to print yourself.<p>the current contest allows people to win a free poster as well as credits for high resolution images.<p>in order to enter the contest, all you need to do is to create your mosaic and apply with it. the mosaic with the most votes wins. so you might need to invite your friends to vote for your mosaic. this contest ends on november 30, so the votes will be counted at midnight that day.<p>here is the contest page, with rules and prizes: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.printmosaic.com&#x2f;contest&#x2f;events&#x2f;1-november<p>is there anyone here who has run a similar type of contest on their startup? i would be curious to hear stories. i&#x27;ll be happy to share my experience once this is done as well.	2014-11-06 13:04:47 UTC		3

869608	ask hn: good strategies for networking while mingling with ceos/decision makers	in the near future i'm attending an event where brain tracy will be holding a seminar about leadership, sales and management.
besides him this event will be full of ceos and thus hold opportunities for networking.<p>now, this really feels like an opportunity one somehow should take advantage of.
only problem is i can't really pinpoint how.<p>so, what would you do in a room full of people who actually can make and take that decision?<p>i'm mostly interested in pure networking to ensure future relations and potentially finding a future vc for my tech-startup, which still is in a very early stage.
and because of this early stage i'm not really able to pitch anything tangible and thus focusing on future relations.<p>what are your experiences and how would you take advantage of an opportunity like this?	2009-10-08 18:30:43 UTC		3
8497044	ask hn: multi paywall services?	i suspect this is probably hard to pull off, but is anyone aware of any efforts to offer access to several paywalled newspapers with a single subscription?  something roughly along the model that cable companies use, where you have one monthly subscription and that gives you access to a number of article reads across e.g. wsj, ft, nyt and a couple of others.  most people discover links to articles on multiple news sites through social networks (and things like google news) but subscription packages with all these publications if you are only reading a certain amount of articles from each is beyond what most consumers would find reasonable.  i think covering this gap will actually be good for the publications.	2014-10-23 07:23:55 UTC		3

"what if you were asked to write two relational tables in a database and link b to the parent a"<p>response given verbally "you would want to create a foreign key for table b, which would be equal to the primary key id of table a..." and so on, they could explain the whole process, but they weren't able to write the exact sql and php code from memory (or they described it from a different framework).  is this typically ok?	2008-07-24 20:05:59 UTC		3

7527525	ask hn: my consulting business is overtaking my day job, lost on how to manage	i&#x27;m currently working a day job as a software developer. at my current job i&#x27;m unsatisfied with the environment and i&#x27;m no longer learning new things. i have put in my notice and leave at the end of the month.&lt;p&gt;on the side i have 2 startups, and 4 projects i&#x27;m managing. that means meeting with clients, doing all the ui&#x2f;ux for 6 projects, handling payments and invoicing, and managing 6 people full time.&lt;p&gt;my questions:&lt;p&gt;a) what software do you use to manage your projects
b) what software do you use to invoice
c) how do you manage people?
d) what resources do you have that would be a good read in relation to project management&lt;p&gt;thanks!	2014-04-03 22:37:39 UTC		4
8693527	ask hn: which websites use gpg public/secret keys for user password retrieving?	i think email accounts are fragile because you must make sure both the client and the server are secure.<p>if you use gpg public&#x2f;secret keys, then you don&#x27;t need email for password retrieving any more. (and no email spams about that)<p>1. for registrations, upload your public key and use your secret key to verify that you own the public key.
2. retrieve your user password is simple, too. the server encrypt some text with your public key, then you use the secret key to decrypt and submit the original text to verify.<p>nowadays, more and more people use password managers to generate strong passwords. why not use gpg? is any website using gpg for password retrieving?	2014-12-03 13:12:09 UTC		4
807146	ask hn: seeking thoughts on a crazy/futuristic idea	i saw a video the other day on the new york tech meetup's site. the speaker (couldnt find the name/video easily) was suggesting that in the future, we'll be using gestures to use computers instead of keyboard/mice.<p>this makes sense given recent developments (microsoft natal, and even to a degree, the iphone). and it is really exciting to think about, because there are so many applications.<p>of course, there will be learning curve, and it might take 10-20 years for this to become mainstream. but it might make sense to start thinking of specific applications that early-adopters would use. (that's us right?). that got me thinking.<p>would it be possible to code via gestures? there would probably be a huge amount of ai required, but it's interesting nonetheless to think about.<p>would this be more efficient? is it possible to do as a yc company? if so, i would love to see someone attack this.	2009-09-05 22:30:18 UTC		4

7235610	anyone in san francisco looking for a co-founder?	because i am.<p>you can learn a bit about me on my personal site:  jessealdridge.com<p>here are some ideas i&#x27;m interested in working on: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;t.co&#x2f;xswy0zdgup<p>email me at jessealdridge@gmail.com if you&#x27;d like to grab lunch or coffee sometime.	2014-02-13 23:49:36 UTC		4
823817	if hn were more popular, would you bother voting on submissions?	your vote here currently yields a lot of power and i suspect that this is part of the appeal to hn.<p>btw, voting power could be reduced to enhance the quality of what gets to the front page by encouraging more people to vote on new submissions as reddit does.  namely, reddit shows a new submission at the top of the list on the front page to encourage more people to vote on it.	2009-09-15 13:54:45 UTC		4
1855479	ask hn: how far in advance should i look for a job in the sf bay area?	i'm moving halfway across the world to the san francisco area on march 13th. very excited.<p>i will be hoping to start work as quickly as possible, but realistically i can hang in there for a few months without one if need be.  a natural progression for me would be to look in either the user research or product management fields. preferably for a startup.<p>question is, when do i start approaching companies? it's over three months away, so i don't want to be forgotten about after making my initial approach, but i also don't want to leave it too late.  it's really hard to judge the state of the job market without being there (mixed messages), which further confuses the process.<p>any advice would be awesome.	2010-11-01 05:20:30 UTC		4

466719	opensourcefood.com acquired	from an email i got:<p>dear open source foodie,<p>jon here. i'm the creator of open source food and today i have an exciting announcement to make.<p>open source food was launched as a personal project in march 2007 and has grown from a little recipe site inhabited by me and my friends, to a popular social network for foodies where thousands of people browse a beautifully-photographed collection of thousands of recipes every day.<p>i started open source food at the same time as i started experimenting with cooking and i can honestly say that without a doubt, my cooking skills have improved by being constantly inspired by the osf community and my friends on there. it has been a most wonderful and delicious journey :)<p>my intention with managing osf was always to grow it into something big, bright and beautiful. even if that meant i could no longer handle everything by myself. i have huge aspirations for the osf community and i think that the time has come where you all deserve more attention and more resources than i can offer alone!<p>that is why i am pleased to announce that from today, osf will be owned and operated by tsavo media who will be integrating it into the daymix network (www.daymix.com). don't worry, they aren't some big, grey corporation - they are a group of highly talented people, and i have friends there. osf is in good hands.<p>i'm not going anywhere though. remember - i still like cooking and eating :) i'm still going to be on the site, posting my recipes and writing comments as usual. i'm also going to be staying around to help take osf to the next level, and with that will come some changes to the site, which i'll tell you about now.<p>tsavo are smart folks and they see the huge potential in the site but we both agree that the name might be holding us back a bit. open source food... it's a little too "techy" - even a little bit cold, when you consider how bright and beautiful the community is. for that reason we will be changing the name. same great site, same great community - but new name and brand new horizons.<p>the new name will be... www.nibbledish.com!<p>i think it's cute. i like it.<p>the name change will not affect service. the transition will happen in the background and one day when you visit the site you will simply be forwarded to the new name automatically - we anticipate this will happen within the next few days. this means it is business as usual, so don't stop posting recipes!<p>thank you to all of you for coming together and creating this community. i thank you for your continuing support of me, the tsavo team and the rest of the daymix network as we launch nibbledish and take it to new heights!<p>happy eating,

1051453	ask hn: a human nature thought experiment.	so, i've been following the avatar/genocide discussion going on here http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1050522
it's an interesting discussion that has provided a lot of emotional responses. this got me thinking about human nature when it's boiled down so i thought i'd conduct a little thought experiment.<p>somewhere in an ocean there's an island. on it are 4 shipwreaked people. one can make sails, one can build a boat, one can sail and one can navigate. the problem is that the island is small and the water and food resources are limited, it cannot support 4 people. with all 4 their probability getting off the island and safely home is good. with only 3 not so much, with two it's poor and with 1 it's essentially impossible. however, the island could support 3 people with some hunger, 2 with realative comfort and 1 in luxury.<p>this is not a high school math problem ("if we just kill one person we can hang out on the island and still have a good chance of getting away"), or a microsoft interview question, it's a human nature problem.<p>imagine that they are all from the same culture/race. what do they do?<p>now image that they are all from different cultures/races (if there are language differences it doesn't affect their ability to build a boat and sail away). what do they do?<p>i know what i think but what about you?	2010-01-13 23:15:21 UTC		5

i could explain it in more detail to anyone interested<p>i also have a flexible design process that would allow the design within each of these layers to emerge quite naturally so it&#x27;s not big design up front<p>if interested please tweet at me @parallelist_ or respond to this thread here<p>thanks!	2014-02-16 20:30:07 UTC		5

3293881	ask hn: nroff wizards, how do you change vim's paragraph definition?	i've always hated that vim distinguishes a blank line from an empty line in paragraph motion. this means that a line with only spaces or tabs will be skipped when using '{}'.<p>googling has only shown similar frustration, but no solution.<p>this is my best shot and it kind of works, but it's an ugly hack, and it doesn't for visual mode:<p><pre><code>   nmap } /^[ \t]*$&#60;cr&#62;:nohlsearch&#60;cr&#62;
   nmap { ?^[ \t]*$&#60;cr&#62;:nohlsearch&#60;cr&#62;
</code></pre>
:help paragraph says that it can be done, but requires nroff.<p><i>paragraph</i>
a paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.  the default is "iplpppqpp tphplipplpitpplpipbp", which corresponds to
the macros ".ip", ".lp", etc.  (these are nroff macros, so the dot must be in
the first column).  a section boundary is also a paragraph boundary.
note that a blank line (only containing white space) is not a paragraph
boundary.
also note that this does not include a '{' or '}' in the first column.  when
the '{' flag is in 'cpoptions' then '{' in the first column is used as a
paragraph boundary |posix|.<p>while we're at it, ignoring email quote prefix would also be great.	2011-11-30 05:28:02 UTC		6

5143320	ask hn: majored in chemistry, should i go back and get a cs degree?	i'll be graduating soon with a bachelor in chemistry, and while the subject is deeply fascinating (i'm taking many graduate courses for fun), there is little future in this career.<p>there isn't enough room to elaborate on this subject here (if anyone wish for it, i can), but to summarize, the job salaries are generally poor with low ceiling and the working conditions are hazardous. graduate school is another can of worms that i won't go into.<p>i'm posting this hn because i have no one that i can trust enough to ask irl and i don't know of any other website with a higher signal:noise ratio.<p>i've recently taken an interest in programming and prospect of freelance work is highly appealing. if i can make minimum wage while working anywhere there is an internet connection, i would take that without hesitation over the standard 9-5 job even if it pays 4x-5x the salary.<p>the problem is, after 140 credit hours, class tuition is raised by 50%. once i graduate (i have 1 credit hr left), going back to get a cs degree would be a problem because many universities restrict 2nd bachelor degree earner from coming in and there is no financial aid after the 1st degree.<p>either way, a cs degree will cause me to go deep into debt and more downtime in school.<p>i have no doubt that i can pick up programming on my own (while moving back into my mother's basement or supporting myself through some part-time job) much faster than through formal classes. after all, most of what i learn from chemistry courses were self-taught, except for the advanced organic graduate courses.<p>but breaking into the freelance arena seems incredibly daunting without any credentials and experience.<p>so in short, i'm completely lost. maybe with advice from hn i won't make the wrong decision a second time.	2013-01-31 03:42:51 UTC		6

4961220	ask hn: would you use a "pandora for local artists"?	this weekend, i hacked together a prototype of a web app i've been thinking about for a while - an online radio station that only plays local music. i live in boston, and we've got an amazing (and huge) local music scene. i love discovering local music (there's not much that compares to the feeling of watching an unknown band absolutely kill a show in some basement in front of 20 people), but i haven't really found a way that's not clunky. i'm lazy - i just want to be played a bunch of local artists, and i want it to be easy to keep tabs on the ones i like (follow, buy tickets, etc).<p>i've been in bands since i was in elementary school, and there's always this point you get to where you've told everyone you possibly can about your new ep/track/show. your growth sort of flatlines, and it's not easy to get it to accelerate again. the biggest problem is just getting your music in front of people that haven't heard it before - it's a logistics problem. like it or hate it, you don't get anywhere if nobody hears it.<p>so i built radius to fill these two needs simultaneously. local artists get a new venue of exposure (a lot like "local hours" on college radio stations - remember radio?). people (like me) get a great, simple way to find and follow local bands. win-win.<p>anyways, i opened radius up to artists in boston last night and was really blown away by the number of signups. so with this post, i'm trying to test the other side of things. how many of your enjoy finding new local bands? would you use something like this to do it? are any of you artists yourself? would you welcome a service where you could put a track in front of people in your city?<p>would love to hear your thoughts/criticism/awesome ideas. thanks in advance!<p>cheers,

8405550	student with over 600 spare hours is looking for cyber security project ideas	hello everyone!
i am a student who is finishing a masters degree in cyber security and digital forensics, and to complete my course i have to develop and submit a project by the end of the second semester.
originally, i was planning to develop an automated platform for internal penetration testing that runs on raspberry pi, but unfortunately for me, scoutbot was released (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;lansec.net&#x2f;project&#x2f;scoutbot&#x2f;) which means that my project idea is not unique anymore.
because of that, i am looking for another project idea and hopefully - you can help me.<p>what can i offer you? over 600 hours of work dedicated to the project by a student who is hardworking and eager to learn new things.
although i am not a programming guru, i have some skills in c#, java and python.<p>what am i looking for? a project idea that is related to cyber security (and it would be perfect if it is directly related to penetration testing since that is the career i pursue). 
i am still interested in using raspberry pi, so maybe someone can suggest me something related to it?<p>i will also be grateful for links to places where i could look for projects.<p>thanks.	2014-10-03 13:59:26 UTC		7

1952931	ask hn: how do i get programmers into the college newsroom?	i'm going to be the sole web developer at my college newspaper (or "media organization" if that suits your fancy) at san jose state next semester.<p>we have an existing website, but it has scaling issues and is just kind of sub-par overall. my editors are looking at going to an outsourced solution that we can't contribute any code to, that basically reduces our responsibilities to drag/drop/copy/paste, with no room for innovation.<p>it's a drag, because ycombinator is looking for news startups, and there's a huge opportunity to do cool stuff with journalism and tech if we can only get cs and cmpe students interested enough to come work on the paper.<p>what would entice you, as a developer, to come work in a newsroom? what should i say to cmpe/cs students either in person or on a flyer, or something?<p>and, more to the point, are there any sjsu students here that are interested? the possibilities are wide open, and we could make some seriously amazing stuff alongside some incredibly talented (though technologically lacking) people.	2010-11-30 03:27:00 UTC		15

1788458	tell hn:  unexpected and rapid promotion in company, advice needed.	i started working for a company in the middle of july as a developer.  i am horribly managed, but it's a good company and they definitely mean well, but i am the first full time programmer they have ever had.<p>i report, (soon to be reported) to the director of technology, he did about 40 / 30 / 30 sysop, framework specific web stuff (messing with our cms), and management.<p>i asked for and got 55k when i started.  i picked the number out of thin air, i imagine i could have got a bit higher without much effort had i asked.<p>anyway the director of technology is leaving, and they are coming to me, not necessarily as a director of technology, but to advise them on what to do and to let me take as much of that job on as i want/feel comfortable with.<p>our key servers are managed by rackspace.  i am a very good php hacker, trying to get more into python, think a lot about getting my own thing going etc.<p>i am not a seasoned sysop in terms of controlling a server serving &#62;1m hits a day.  i've used linux exclusively for years.<p>i am very comfortable with my current position, but have <i>a lot</i> to say about how the company is leveraging technology and software, and i know it's my opportunity to be listened to on that.<p>i have no idea what to ask for in terms of compensation, what to think about, etc.  i am 27, with nearly no 'corporate' (this is a small company &#60; 50 people plus a couple dozen free lancers here and there) experience, no management experience.  my current salary is about double what income i was used to my whole life.<p>thanks for anything.	2010-10-13 19:14:29 UTC		17

1883313	ask hn: have you had laser eye surgery? what was your experience?	hi,<p>i am a long term hn member writing under an anonymous account as this is a somewhat personal issue for me.<p>i have been short-sighted (myopia of about -5.00 in both eyes) all my life, and generally wear both contact lenses and glasses. i find contact lenses really irritate my eyes when programming (dry eyes due to less blinking when on computer) and am fed up of issues with glasses (steaming, cleaning, etc) and recently have been considering laser eye surgery.<p>i live in the uk, and have booked consultations at the 3 main providers here - ultralase, optimax, optical express. i'll write my assessment of them each later once i go for my consultation with the last provider at the end of the month, but so far have concluded that one has to really research the area to avoid much of the nonsense that they tell patients especially with regard to equipment and surgeons used and why e.g. ultralase charge £4700 for lasik+intralse+wavefront and say they use new bausch &#38; lomb lasers that has higher resolution (dpi) and better surgeons (but ironically most of them are ex-optimax surgeons) but optimax charge £2395 for a similar lasik+intralase+wavefront procedure but say they use nidek lasers as gives better results (even though it is older generation device) and they are cheaper as they already bought their machines and premises and have less ongoing overheads.<p>anyway, i was wondering if any other hn members have had laser eye surgey (or thought about it and why you did not do it), what prodcedure you took (e.g. lasek, lasik, with wavefront and/or intralase), what your experience was like, what equipment was used (e.g. visx, nidek, alegretto), and whether you researched this and what your thoughts are about various equipment-factors in the final result, and most importantly your surgeon and final result.<p>thank you!	2010-11-08 18:10:32 UTC		19

"honey, don't you come sleep with me?" - "no! i must check hn and write something, i'll be back in 10 mins" i it takes 2-3 hours checking, replying, commenting on hn, facebook, twitter etc. and i have too many things to do. but my brain doesn't care.<p>why the heck this happens all the time to me? how do you motivate yourself to work, to concentrate? what should i do?	2012-03-22 01:51:30 UTC		23

1663922	ask hn: experiences with paypal? would you recommend or kill it with fire?	hey hn,<p>i'm gradually working gathering a few diverse income sources (as side-projects), all of which pay me via paypal.<p>as i'm sure we all have, i've heard all sorts of horror stories about paypal, but i've only heard the strong negatives -- mainly account freezes due to a sudden spike in income that triggers paypal's anti-fraud measures.  i've also heard about delays in releasing money or getting the money out of paypal.<p>so, i ask:<p><pre><code>  * what are your first/second-hand experiences using paypal?  
  ** and for your larger amounts of money (say, $500-$2000 a month)?
  * potential problems/things to watch out for?
  * any viable alternatives? (i know about wepay)</code></pre>	2010-09-05 03:12:05 UTC		30

3966301	ask hn: losing faith in the startup where i'm employee #1	i'm very new to the startup world. a year ago, i left academia to join a startup as the first engineer employee. the skies were bright, we were going to change the world and become rich and all be happy together.<p>now a year later, things are way more gloom. we haven't raised any money, as of today we have effectively 0 active users, and our total revenue over the past year has been ~$100.<p>out of 3 founders, none is technical (the cto is a very, very well connected industry veteran though), and they are all very unfocused and out of touch with certain realities (for example, they filed a patent for a silly tech idea right after incorporation and keep trying to implement that technology in products although it doesn't really solve anything).<p>during meetings, i always feel like a killjoy by attempting to be realistic and focused and reserved about the brand new idea they come up with every other week and that i need to get started on right when the meeting ends.<p>i don't feel like it'll get better, and although it was a great opportunity i think it's time for me to move on to brighter horizons.<p>the main problem is that i've grown to really like the founders on a personal level, they are really well connected so i wouldn't want them to tarnish my reputation as a young engineer completely new to the valley/startup world, and if i leave, the company will probably die off as i'm the only one writing code and making products exist (they'd probably end up paying contractors/freelancers as they can't afford to be competitive on salary or benefits).<p>i think these last few points might be the result of my inexperience with startups and that i dug myself into that hole— but any insight or advice would be very, very much appreciated.&#60;p&#62;thanks!	2012-05-13 07:41:32 UTC		137

7869069	ask hn: hints for plain language legal?	i&#x27;ve got scores of pages of legal, across multiple documents for this early stage project. it&#x27;s quite hard to decipher.  i understand boilerplate is part of a lot of these things - as well as some project specific definitions.  of course i&#x27;ve talked to council about these, i&#x27;m informed.  my partners have proper council as well.  but we keep sorting through all these docs, sorting numbers, making sure it&#x27;s in the proper places and all that.<p>why don&#x27;t these things come with cover letter or executive summary on the front - like one sentence bullet points to summarise the rest of the document.<p>then i&#x27;d have something to understand; my council could verify with the long-form details.  couldn&#x27;t all the long-form documents references points on the short-form?<p>like:
  &quot;compensation will be $200k&#x2f;yr[1]&quot;<p>and the long form could reference [1] all over the place?  like variables?<p>does this exist? are there any good places to get some plain language legal documents?	2014-06-09 16:15:24 UTC		1

6044966	ask hn: how do you think?	i always wonder how people see or think during different kind of activity. do they visualize pictures, do they say word, do the imagine things? what happens when someone try to solve math problems, what they think about?
for example when i&#x27;m reading or writing, i always &quot;say out loud the words&quot; in my head, when writing code, sometimes it&#x27;s easier for me to think about visual representation of a problem, like diagrams, sets, draw x-es or anything.
my father see a big virtual map in front of him when driving.

personally, if i am one of the customers of these companies which the founders have left, i might be nervous using the products or services.
my other concern is if any ycombinator partners have had any experience in keeping the companies alive for the long term (10 years?).	2015-05-29 02:49:45 UTC		1

10167867	ask hn: best places for intellectual discussion?	hn has a pretty high level of discussion most of the time in the comment threads, but unfortunately it&#x27;s it-centric and not very well-trafficked. i&#x27;m looking for something similar to hn, but more general and with more contributors-- but not a place that just discusses any old daily news item. places that are hideouts of industry-specific folks are okay, provided that there&#x27;s enough constructive &quot;off topic&quot; that is allowed, like here at hn.<p>does anyone know of anywhere that fits the bill? reddit used to be a barely-acceptable alternative that had intelligence hiding in the crannies once in a while, but now it&#x27;s completely overrun and commercialized. voat suffers from the same problem, except it never really had a golden era before the shills and trolls and idiots were out in force.	2015-09-03 22:23:24 UTC		1

3569170	discuss: how path et al should do contact discovery	this seems to be a simple problem, and i think a simple solution. i haven't worked on a system needing such a thing, but i figured we could have a discussion here so in the future when i/we need to, there won't be a problem.<p>goals: provide a mechanism to determine if any of a users contacts is already a member of  given service.<p>requirements: personal identifying information should not be transmitted across the wire. data transmitted across the wire should not be susceptible to mitm attacks. any data stored should be useless if compromised.<p>proposed solution: data transmitted should use any available encryption scheme built into the protocol (ssl). personally identifying information (phone numbers) should be encrypted using asymmetrical encryption before being transmitted. if this data is stored it should be encrypted using a different encryption mechanism, such as bcrypt. any lookups performed will use this same mechanism to generate the lookup key.<p>incomplete. lets discuss any holes and improvements.	2012-02-08 23:59:12 UTC		2

5632410	when bugs cost users' money (airbnb's in this case)	what is your responsibility when a bug affects a user? does that responsibility change when it costs your users money?<p>the regrettable inevitability of bugs in software has been documented by greater than i and to begrudge their existence would be as pointless as someone with 1 karma posting on hn (oh, wait). more interesting is the responsibility a developer feels (be that an individual or an organisation) when a bug affects their users and how the user's loss affects their reaction.<p>i've worked on various consumer and business facing products and have always taken bugs personally, endeavouring to redress the deficit caused by my, or my colleagues', negligence (all be it, inevitable). mercifully i've never actually caused a user to lose money but i was recently a victim and thought i'd share:<p>i travel to paris most weeks for work and use http://airbnb.com quite often to stay a couple of nights in apartments around the city. today i'll be moving into a place that i booked around a week ago and, just yesterday, the owner and i realised that i was charged only a half of what they was expecting. it turns out that airbnb were afflicted by some bug at the time of my booking that meant i saw and booked the apartment for half the cost (this was confirmed in an email to the host that i haven't seen yet, but will later). so that i have somewhere to stay tonight, we've compromised by meeting half way so that we're equally out of pocket (and i'm going to look after their cats, which is actually a bonus).<p>clearly airbnb aren't going to cover the cost of their mistake as this would expose them to much greater liabilities, but what <i>should</i> their responsibility be in this case? i know that if it had been my fault then i would feel pretty bad about the situation and grovel like the pathetic wretch i am, but would i feel compelled to compensate? perhaps personal responsibility has give way to corporate necessity.<p>still, seems pretty off to me...	2013-04-30 14:40:50 UTC		2

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i9hvzqtbn0<p>this one i remember only because it was absolutely eerie at 4:00 on a summer morning. (i had to listen to the radio at night, else i couldn't fall asleep.)<p>our lady peace - superman's dead
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uozlshudbxy<p>great song from around that time from one of the most underrated '90s bands.<p>white town - your woman
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvl-zznd3vu<p>quirky, odd song from an unusually talented, but unpopularizable, one-hit wonder. vintage '97.<p>what are your summer of '97 memories, songs, and (of course) hacking projects?	2008-12-31 15:25:47 UTC		2

6858831	ask hn: i've finished developing an iphone application. how do i protect myself?	currently i live in reno, nevada.<p>i got an ios developer&#x27;s license under my name in february 2013. since it is under my name, it will be displayed when i submit it to the app store. i do not want to release it under my own name in fear of getting sued by a patent troll.<p>the application itself is a music player, which streams audio from another source that i do not control. as such, i am afraid that it might be possible that i may violate some term, or i might break some dlc rule or something to that effect. or just plain old bad luck with some random patent troll.<p>i have done some research and it appears that my best course of action is to start an llc and get a new apple developer license under the llc&#x27;s name. i really don&#x27;t know how i would go about acquiring the llc, though. i also do not know if there is anything else i should do to protect myself that i may have overlooked. it would be great if someone could clarify this for me!<p>thanks.	2013-12-06 01:40:20 UTC		3

the idea is for the community to select an organization to build it and to have no one single &quot;owner&quot; once its launched into space. perhaps the organization that built it and is composed of anyone and everyone willing to participate can &quot;own&quot; the satellite.<p>how much would something like this cost, in terms of time, people, money and other resources?
would you fund an idea such as this? 
what are the legal implications of someone undertaking such a project?<p>i know, this does sound a little absurd, but i cannot help wonder what if this was the case, what if we could connect to a satellite anywhere anytime and communicate privately. i would definitely fund such a cause.	2013-09-06 09:40:28 UTC		4

2429427	partner-in-crime (developer) for hachi labs, inc.	hey there!<p>we are looking to add one more technical member to our core founding team.<p>check out our splash page http://www.gohachi.com/ - if it piques your interest (don't go by ui - revamp in process), ping us at info@hachilabs.com, and we’ll provide you with an invite code to play with the app.<p>and if you enjoy playing with it, and have ideas on how you can take it notches above, then let’s talk! we can’t tell you how anxiously we’ve been waiting to hear from you.<p>a li’l about us -
we’re a small team - crazy enough to leave our cozy comfy jobs, near-perfect silicon valley life, pumping in our hard earned savings in to the startup, and working anywhere between 10-15 hour days (what's a weekend??!) ...and loving every minute of it. we do keep getting help, every now and then, from our awesome friends and others. and, we have insanely rocking super star entrepreneurs, investors from silicon valley advising us! overall the team is star-studded (so to say) with iit, stanford, urbana champaign alums.. though we don't really care so much about pedigree, but the passion and value each member brings to the team.<p>we have an alpha product, and we’re working with a set of early adopters to evolve it further. the feedback from our alpha users is encouraging - to say the least... and that also means, we have lots to do. that’s why we’re looking to add one more member - hopefully, you!<p>our beta list is steadily growing and is impressive enough to pique the interest of some angel investors in silicon valley.<p>this is not just a cool product we're building, but a viable business. it's $11+ billion industry and rapidly growing, and money is already being made. and we are fundable. we were just offered a $40k grant opportunity (no equity involved) - we decided to pass (we’re happy to share our reasons, when we talk more with you). besides, we’ve already opened discussions with angel investors in the us. that said, we can comfortably do without funding for a reasonable amount of time (remember - the hard earned savings?!).
we are incorporated in us.<p>a li’l about you -
you should have some background in computer science, be it in the form of hobby programming, involvement in open source projects or something equivalent. having built an app from scratch is a big huge plus!<p>we don't care if you are not familiar with the tools and technologies we use (cakephp, html, css, javascript, jquery, social network apis), so long as you are superbly confident that you can pick them up quickly and write and push code to live site! it would be a big plus if you have an eye for good ui.<p>we are looking for someone who shares our entrepreneurial passion, is ambitious, open to ideas, has an appetite for startup roller-coaster ride.<p>this will be an equity based role - atleast till we're funded. we’d highly prefer someone who can commit full time. we're currently camping in bangalore - india (may move back to silicon valley at some point), and we're open to working remotely.<p>ping us right away, if this is you!<p>info@hachilabs.com	2011-04-10 13:23:29 UTC		5

this is done via a combination of asking questions designed to trip you up and interrupting. the other thing i&#x27;ve noticed is that in meetings he will sometimes ignore direct questions and just reply with whatever he was thinking about instead.<p>for example i&#x27;ve seen this happen several times during group interviews, the candidate will ask a direct question and instead of giving an answer he will rephrase the problem.<p>during a recent group interview i asked the candidate &quot;how would x work&quot; and he interrupted and steered it in a different direction.<p>my question is what should i do about this? i&#x27;ve raised some of these points with vpe and cofounders, but not the details. does every company have people who behave like that? this is my first full time job, so i&#x27;m having a hard time finding comparison points.	2014-10-28 01:33:05 UTC		5

3273516	ask hn: a 2nd year sf technologist's philosophical dilemma	hey folks,<p>i'm at a personal development milestone. something's not working.<p>i've been in the bay area going on my second year now and i'm wondering how common it is to come out here and eventually get turned off by the whole scene, in general.<p>back in the beginning, i grew up as a huge nerd in the southeast - it was always my thing. i could hide away in my bedroom and hack, as the world around me held down mostly non-technical lifestyles. when i emerged, i had a product of my own creation, mostly untainted by the scene's societal norms, that everyone around me thought was really 'neat', since they had no idea how it worked or, for the few technical people i knew, were interested in learning about it and/or were happy to teach me more. in my off time, i could resume doing non-technical things and 'blend in' and, when i was ready to again, retire to my bedroom and begin being a hacker again.<p>my bay area experience has, overall, proven to be a mostly disenchanting departure from this.<p>everyone here is into tech.
there is no way 'hiding away and making an iphone app' is your unique thing.
the instant you show your work to anyone else, you almost certainly encounter one or more of:<p>-a pissing contest<p>-criticism of implementation details or features, language choice, etc<p>-comparison to someone/something else far more prolific and a subsequent lack of being impressed<p>-or, if you've found a non-technical person to demo to, a lack of interest simply because it's not a world-changing tech like facebook or twitter, which is down the street<p>don't get me wrong. i'm not making crap, here, nor am i a new kid on the block. i've worked at google, apple, and microsoft and am currently one of two engineers at a small company you may well have seen in techcrunch a few times.<p>but is it normal to be so dejected by this area that you're turned off to lots of things, entirely? and is that necessarily a bad thing or an implicit professional/personal failure, of sorts?<p>i can appreciate the fact the bay area is fast-paced, meritocratic, high stress, all of that. those are good things!<p>but, operating in the bay area is quickly draining the love of the game from me. in fact, i often find myself considering moving somewhere slightly-but-not-mostly technical, like austin or charlotte (hey, i have a thing for the south, too).<p>anyone else experience this roadblock? any tips or suggestions? i'm young and an open book and you'll have my eternal gratitude.	2011-11-24 07:23:29 UTC		6

4832543	ask hn: impossible client? impossible playing field?	i'm running into an issue, i s'pose, that seems related to the "curse of knowledge." everyone tells me in response, "you know too much about the details, etc." but is this really the case? i sincerely wish to ask hn for the fact that i am losing my mind. and it seems to indicate a larger issue, related to the fact that most people literally respond with shock and almost fear when they see me work at my terminal or vim. i'm afraid to work in public now, honestly, since doing so brings about so much bloody negative reaction. (all of my clients have been this seemingly difficult. i'm starting to worry if i can even work in this city. months back, say in the summer, a lead developer at cpanel responded with confusion: "what is sass/less/etc?")<p>but please review this e-mail (and i'll keep the typos):<p>to client,<p>also, did you go through my last e-mail regarding github? you mentioned changes on the site, and github would be he easiest way to keep track of those changes. it would also ensure that we are on the same page. please review that e-mail. if you did not receive it, please let me know.<p>i have also looked into digital signage solution that are cheap. we are looking at rough $30-$40 per sign to run a small microcontroller system that can manage those displays. here is a link to the idea: https://github.com/wireload/screenly-ose<p>---<p>his response?<p>"hey man- i just saw it this wknd - not really sure i understand it"	2012-11-26 16:14:14 UTC		6

8339504	ask hn: how can i save my failing product?	background: my product extracts data from pdf files. free users get 8 free jobs. paying users get 40 jobs. each job is a data extraction from a pdf file.<p>problem: user engagement terminates after they run into a bad extraction. on some pdf files it just doesn&#x27;t work, it returns empty data. most times it extracts data but not exactly to what the user had in mind (duplicate, mismatching column, unwanted data). right after this happens, the user will either try a few more times with other pdf files or just give up and never return again. to fix the cases where it returns empty data, it takes me at least 10 hours.<p>concern: i can&#x27;t support myself to work on such fixes and i can&#x27;t see the number of bad data extraction that needs to be fix decreasing for each user. it&#x27;s very tough problem to extract data from pdf files, it&#x27;s never perfect but i was hoping it was good enough for some users. even a paying user with their number of fix requests, i would have a hard time getting to them all. the bigger problem is that i priced is cheap so i would get more users, turns out this would lead to a far greater number of problems being encountered with the data extraction process.<p>search for solution: my immediate thought is to ditch the free plan, increase the product price and somehow deal with the number of fixes being requested and barely breakeven.<p>i don&#x27;t know if anyone&#x27;s been in this situation, it almost seems like the end user cares about the result of the data extraction unlike say a bookkeeping web application that has a much narrow scope of problems expected. like if a pdf doesn&#x27;t extract correctly, it&#x27;s of no value to the user so they will want this to be fixed right? and as they keep encountering more and more fixes i won&#x27;t be able to keep up....i&#x27;m really about call it quits i&#x27;ve worked long and hard on this project and i don&#x27;t think i can go on.	2014-09-19 08:41:49 UTC		7

727602	ask hn: joining an incubator. concerned about 2 items in the contract. advice?	i've been developing my web startup for a while now. i applied to this government funded incubator in my country to be able to use their services. it's not a profitable entity and aims only to boost technology startups in the country.<p>i applied to join, and after several meetings, they sent us the agreement contract. two items stood out the most to me in the contract:<p>1) the incubatee shall, permit the licensor to participate in agreed negotiations or discussions in respect of incubatee's business activities or the financing thereof.<p>and<p>2) the incubatee shall, after expiry or termination of agreement or after graduation and for five (5) years thereafter, provide the licensor on regular intervals agreed on, with written reports showing its business status and business progress, number of its employees, turnover, capital on value, total third party investment, copies of audited balance sheet and accounts and other similar matters.  this obligation shall survive any expiry and any termination or discharge of the agreement.<p>now the agreement does not include funding, although they can make it easier to get once we sign (and want it). the services i'm after are mainly office space, simplification of governmental procedures (in a 3rd world country these can get tiring), access to legal advice, and the advice they can deliver on things like business model and marketing (although they don't seem particularly savvy about web startups).<p>it's enticing because these services are free, they only want this monitoring and other measures that would help the success of the venture. i just wanted to make sure that these do not encumber our startup, or make it unappealing to potential investors.<p>what do you guys think? is this okay or not?<p>ps: i'm assuming they want the data to monitor the performance of the businesses they incubate. the agreement states that this information will be treated as confidential.<p>any help would be appreciated.	2009-07-28 07:46:43 UTC		8
2355422	y combinator reality tv show	daniel loewenherz’s post on the full story behind breakup notifier (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2348702 or http://dlo.me/breakup-notifier/) got me thinking that it would awesome to have a web-based y combinator reality tv show or channel. where viewers, from around the world, could literally see what it takes to create a startup.<p>i, for one, am tired of all the music, food, fashion, dieting, dating, celebrity, etc reality tv shows which currently exist and would love to learn something useful for a change. i’ve also observed that people enjoy watching “behind the scenes” footage. a look at the comments on any of the techcrunch cribs videos (http://bit.ly/gveobr or http://tcrn.ch/g2i21x ) confirms this.<p>a tv show can also be beneficial to the startups themselves (just look at what idols has done for musicians)
creates brand loyalty and early adopters of products
you can get direct feedback from your audience during product development
viewers could give you advice or make suggestions if your stuck … you don’t have to do it alone!<p>[an incentive to the y combinator team, the show could make money from both subscriptions (per episode/weekly/monthly/year) and advertisements, think about it]<p>how many of you guys would, would be interested in watching such a show? what would you want to see during the show? what reality show format would be best for y combinator?

3049258	ask hn: successful startups that didn't come from top-tier universities	reading about startups i always have the feeling that most of the "hyped" startups come from the ivy league so sometimes it seems like it can be very difficult for someone who didn't come from that circle to succeed, specially in the valley.
can you give any examples (or are you an example) of a successful startup that didn't come from a topnotch university? would you mind sharing some of your story, the problems you had to deal (if any) for not being from a top-tier university?	2011-09-28 18:32:44 UTC		8

948963	ask hn: bank 2.0. how would you build a better bank?	i was thinking about consumer banking while reading this thread: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=948460<p>i came to the conclusion that consumer banks have a lot that are in need of fixing/improving. i posted a comment about how i would build bank 2.0 if i had the means. i figured that i would post a discussion on the subject to hopefully get a lot of input from a lot of smart people.<p>my question to you is, how would you build your bank 2.0? how would you make money? how would you be different from other banks out there? you have some seed money (for new banks, this might be about $20m), and your goal is to start a bank in your town. how would you start, and how would you grow?<p>i'd like to focus this discussion more on consumer banking (think, checking, saving, and small business accounts).	2009-11-18 19:48:49 UTC		14

79083	starting up: registering a company	we are trying to startup and now we are on the stage when we'll need to have our legal company.<p>any advice will be helpful and appreciated - i do have a lot of questions, cause i never did that myself before.<p>1) when it is smart and necessary to create a company? -- we are about to launch and provide paid services. i know we can still act as a private person, but then all the legal actions (if any :-) will be against private person, and it will be persons' responsibility. companies like "protect" people against that, right?<p>2) which type is preferable - c-corp or s-corp? we will be looking for funding - angel or vc, so need to think ahead not to have this as a problem to get funds.<p>3) how to register company easier? i found a bunch  of sites, but which one is better? any experience? <p>4) we are living in california, and company needs to be in california or in delaware (i heard that last one is easier with the taxes questions, etc.?) what happens if we'll relocate eventually to different state?<p>5) do we need to have an office address? or some specific p.o. box? we are living in apartments, so we definitely will move, so all the addresses are kind of "temporary" ;-)<p>6) where can i find information on which tax forms do we need to fill and when? for the company? we do not suppose to have a lot of going on there for now, so i hope to be able to do that myself, but need some guides...<p>7) any rules or guides on how we need to log our investments into this company? i.e. my partner invested 5k and me invested 6k, so do we need to put this legally somehow? we trust each other, so we don't really need that, but may be it's legally required?<p>8) do we need business account (checking, credit)? probably we don't need it, but may be it will be smart to open small business credit line from the very beginning to grow eventually?<p>...and anything else you can add. thanks!	2007-11-13 06:13:52 UTC		19

2320613	ask hn: an acceptable erlang	i've been experimenting with erlang, and it's perhaps the most frustrating language i've ever worked with. i've mostly been using learn you an erlang, and switching to programming erlang when i need more background.<p>i am <i>fully on-board</i> with the async, share-nothing, message-passing, "let it crash" paradigm. i think it's inspired, and i'd really like to build some applications in it. except for the fact that the syntax completely mangles my mind. i can't seem to understand it at all. given a code snippet, my guess for the correct statement ending is a total shot in the dark. comma, semicolon, period? no idea. i can't imagine i'll ever be able to build something with any real functionality, apart from passing messages from one place to another.<p>i know this is the sort of question that will raise the ire of most aficionados, but is there an "acceptable erlang"? something you can write day-to-day, but get close to the same programming paradigm? i've seen akka on scala, but that looks like it's going to be really heavy. node.js, afaik, is async, but the fault-tolerant bits aren't there. stackless python or twisted don't seem to be very similar.<p>any ideas?	2011-03-13 23:49:06 UTC		28

1946416	ask hn: what's your favorite online-backup tool?	hey hn -<p>it's almost 2011, and my backup solution still calls for semi-regular huddles between my laptop and a few external drives, which i randomly scatter between home and school for redundancy. this is pretty low-tech, all things considered, and i'd like to enter the future. right now at best i have a hodgepodge of things that i will try to upload to google docs or suchlike. not so pretty!<p>where to start? i could set up from cron scripts and buy amazon s3 space, but that really doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution (perhaps for some software projects, but not for a personal basis).<p>options i'm familiar with are, most prominently, mozy (mozy.com) and carbonite (carbonite.com). i guess using something like dropbox could fulfill this need to some extent as well.<p>would love to hear feedback about these services for automated backups and any other alternatives i should consider.<p>thanks!	2010-11-28 01:59:34 UTC		53

1832741	offer hn: room in japan	i recently married and moved to japan. we live in a small city called tokushima in about 70 square meter apartment. currently we have a free room that we haven't yet decided what to do with. if you've been wanting to experience japan, this could be your chance. you would fly to osaka airport, meet me (i don't mind visiting osaka every now and then), maybe see osaka first and then take a bus to tokushima. you could stay in the room for two or three days and then continue your trip on your own. you can take a boat to tokyo, for example.<p>if this sounds like fun, see my email in my profile. i thought this might be an interesting way for me to meet other developers, too.	2010-10-26 03:02:19 UTC		77

i hear everyone has one or two laptops/mac mini which you are not using so much (mac or win).
how would you like to lease it for some amount (obviously the amount cannot to be too big, we are talking about startups here)?
if yes, then how much? (say for 1-2 years old macbook or an average configuration windows laptop)<p>obviously, asking party will have to reveal their true identity (for merchandise safety), their name, startup's name and obviously you can choose whom to lease?<p>the price will be firm (predefined depending on the config).	2013-02-15 22:51:27 UTC		1

2918968	show hn: google reader user style. google+ styling & reeder functionality	i want to share my weekend project with you. it is a custom style for google reader.<p><pre><code>  the home page: http://testranking.com/google-plus-reeder.html

  direct link to style: http://userstyles.org/styles/51770/google-reeder
</code></pre>
the dated ui is the main reason why i am reluctant to use the best free rss reader (in my opinion). so i decided to bring the new google styling to the reader.<p>i was not satisfied with the result compared to the reeder application (mac only), so i reworked the style until it had some reeder functionality.<p>i would be very thankful if you could have a look at the style and give me some feedback. don't be afraid to call my baby ugly. i want to have the best usability for my most used web-app. i have been using this style for the past 2 weeks and it works for me, but if there are improvements (or bugs) please let me know.<p>to get to the reeder layout use the keys "u" or "f" + "2"	2011-08-24 00:43:08 UTC		1

(please tell me if i just wasn't googling it right and this is very old news, or of course if this idea is very idiotic.)<p>i don't own a tablet (anymore) but i used the ipad for quite some time and also got to check out the webos tablet as well as a few android tablets. i live in germany and if i want to read some of the newspapers i like i would need to download apps. no a lot of people said that they felt like the times of the "multimedia cd-rom" are back.<p>i think we need an open standard. a pdf (i know, pdf isn't that open) for magazines, books, etc. maybe on the base of html5, css and javascript. with conventions and guidelines for user-interactions, open for everyone. then we only would need to program readers for that type of file-format. you wouldn't need to download apps anymore and people who create those magazines wouldn't need to write different apps for different devices. you create that open document and people can read it on every plattform.<p>(sorry for my english, i'm not native.)<p>pell

1002910	motorbike drivers  - clothing and weather protection	motorbike drivers  - clothing and weather protection<p>when riding mopeds or motorcycles it is always very important that you wear the correct protective clothing in order to protect you from the weather and also to help other road users to see you.<p>importance wear a safety helmet when riding a motorcycle on the road. you should also consider using the following items of clothing when riding a motorcycle:<p>·	visors or goggles
·	gloves and gauntlets
·	protective clothing
·	boots
·	visibility aids
·	safety helmets<p>by law you must wear a safety helmet when riding a motorcycle on the road. all helmets sold in the uk must either:<p>·	comply with british standard bs 6658:1985 and carry the bsi kitemark
·	comply with unece regulation 22.05
·	comply with any standard accepted by a member of the european economic area which offers a level of safety and<p>protection equivalent to bs 6658:1985 and carry a mark equivalent to the bsi kitemark.<p>damage to helmets<p>if your helmet receives any serious impact you should always buy a new one. damage won't always be visible to the naked eye.<p>for this reason you should never buy a second-hand helmet.<p>visors and goggles<p>a visor or goggles are vital to protect your eyes from wind, rain, insects and road dirt while driving. all visors or goggles must comply with a british standard and display a bsi kitemark, or they must comply with a european standard which offers a level of safety and protection at least equivalent to the british standard and carry a mark equivalent to the bsi kitemark (ece 22-05).<p>if you need glasses or contact lenses to read a numberplate at the prescribed distance then you must wear your glasses or contact lenses when you ride. you should not wear tinted glasses, visors or goggles if you are riding in the dark or conditions of poor visibility.<p>it is very important that you keep your visor or goggles clean. you must have a clear view of the road ahead at all times. to clean your goggles or visor wash them with warm soapy water. do not use solvents or petrol.<p>protective clothing, motorcycle clothing is of two main types:<p>·	clothing made from man-made materials
·	leather clothing<p>when you are choosing protective motorcycle clothing make sure you look for additional protection for the shoulders, elbows and knees.<p>gloves and gauntlets<p>good gloves or gauntlets are essential when your ride a motorcycle. never be tempted to ride without gloves. if you fall off you could seriously injure your hands.<p>motorcycle boots<p>it is important to wear good boots or footwear when you ride a motorcycle. if you wear sandals or trainers your feet will have little protection if you fall off.<p>riding in cold weather<p>when riding in very cold weather your hands and feet can become painfully cold. no matter how good your gloves or boots, the cold will eventually get through. if you're serious about motorcycling in cold weather you should consider buying electrically heated inner gloves or electrically heated handlebar grips. however, these accessories put a large demand on your motorcycle's electrical generator so you should check that it can cope with the extra demands before you buy and fit them.<p>visibility aids for motorcyclists<p>many road accidents involving motorcyclists occur because another road user didn't see them. using some form of visibility aid will help others to see you. remember you need to be visible from the side as well as the front and back.
wearing fluorescent orange or yellow clothing in daylight will improve your chances of being seen.<p>other methods you could use to help other road users to see you in daylight include:<p>·	wearing a white helmet
·	wearing brightly coloured clothing
·	riding with your headlamp on dipped beam<p>to improve visibility in the dark you need to wear reflective material. they work by reflecting the light from headlamps of other vehicles. this makes you much more visible from a long distance away.<p>eager to drive a motorcycle on the roads?<p>read information about motorbike driving practical test here -

4439565	lenovo is holding me with no money and no laptop for one month	hello,<p>i usually don't write this kind of emails/rants, but the circumstances are pushing me to do it.<p>last night i tried to buy a fine lenovo laptop, after going through the checkout process, i got an error stating there was an issue with my card.<p>"i must have entered the card number wrong" was my first idea, but i went ahead and checked my bank account and found the money was actually taken from my account.<p>"maybe it did go trough and my connection somehow failed, i'll wait for the confirmation email". no it didn't. i tried to contact phone customer service, but the only rep. that i was able to contact, insisted that i had to pay for a $3 dollars "gift voucher" if i wanted to talk to support, then he tried to convince me of paying at least $1.<p>i felt insulted.<p>next step was live chat, wich was actually fast, but incredibly not-helpful. they stated that the money was not really charged to my card (because lenovo only accepts amex international cards, and us issued cards), "just" authorized. wich means i have to wait 30 days for my money to be back in my account, and being able to buy a laptop.<p>i've had experiences with other stores when buying with my international card, when the store does not accept them, they just don't auth or charge anything and display a sad but innocent warning.<p>if lenovo just had on their website, just before people entering their credit card details, a warning stating that you only accept us cards, or amex international cards, i am confident i would not have proceeded.<p>lenovo, please, fix my issue. i now have no laptop, and no money to buy one. and i need the first to work, and have some of the latter.	2012-08-27 16:32:24 UTC		1

1095203	first victim of oracle since sun buyout?	hello fellow project administrators,<p>it's with a sad heart that we have to announce that the kenai.com domain will be shutdown as part of the consolidation of project hosting sites now that sun is a wholly owned subsidiary of oracle.<p>project kenai has always existed as two different things: kenai the infrastructure, and kenai the website (kenai.com).  while it has come time to close the domain of kenai.com, the infrastructure (which is already used under netbeans.org) will live on to support other domains in the future.<p>with this decision from oracle to close the kenai.com domain, it is now time for project owners to begin the process of migrating their repositories and content over to other locations.  a few things to note as you begin this process:<p><pre><code>   * more then one forum thread is going on at this time discussing alternative sites for hosting projects; this one appears to be the most active:</code></pre>
http://kenai.com/projects/help/forums/general/topics/2406-alternatives-for-kenai-com-<p><pre><code>   * for source repositories, svnsync can be used for subversion.  git, and hg are pretty simple by nature to move.

   * wiki source code is available to all project admins and can be cut and paste into any other site that supports the mediawiki syntax.

   * for issue trackers and forum content, we are looking at ways to make that content available, but we have nothing at this time in place.  if you can come up with a way to move the content on your own, proceed as such.  please do not wait for us.
</code></pre>
the website will be closed to the creation of new projects in the next week.  the complete shutdown of the site and the removal of the domain will be completed in the next 60 days (april 2nd 2010). this should provide ample time for all projects to be moved to a new home of the project owners choice.<p>if you have a private project (only available to sun internal projects) those projects will continue to exist.  we will send information about how to access those in a separate notice.<p>any public projects that remain after the 60 day limit (april 2nd 2010) will be removed when the site is turned off.<p>it has been an amazing ride, and a great pleasure to personally work with so many of you over the last year or so. from the entire project kenai team i want to thank you for all of the feedback, criticisms, and support over our time together.<p>with much respect,
the project kenai team	2010-02-02 16:17:21 UTC		1

1123008	looking for opinions from people who teach sql 	thanks for reading...<p>i have an excel add-in that allows you to preform sql select in excel (www.querycell.com)<p>it's been suggested to me that i should make a version specifically for people learning sql.  so lots of tutorials, maybe register a www.learnsql.com like domain and really push it as an educational tool.<p>question : would you use a tool like this to teach sql or recommend it to people learning sql ?<p>imho :<p>pros
 - visual feedback (you can highlight/color rows that match your query)
 - familiar comfortable environment for newbies
 - possibly easier to set up in a night-classes or school environment than databses<p>cons 
 - if someone is learning sql they will eventually need to learn about a rdbms so why not immediately

4619454	automated kiosk for novels? (redbox for books)	hi,
i wanted to know what some of you thought of an automated kiosk for books. basically, for a small fee of around $2 a month, you could go to a box, select your novel, then go ahead and read it for as long as you want. i know ebooks are where it's at these days, but i just keep running into people who love and miss the feel of real books, yet find it inconvenient to go to a bookstore or library to get one book. that is why i think placing a kiosk at places people go to all the time, such as super markets, gas stations, street corners, etc, will allow people to come across these machines without having to go out of their way.  they will be going to places they normally go to various times a week.<p>therefore, i just wanted some feedback on the idea. would you use it or not? the pricing point would have to be very low, which i think $2 a month is. i feel if it works for dvds, then it can work for novels, please let let me know what you think!
thanks!	2012-10-06 01:33:30 UTC		2

    sell your assets to maximize my roi.&quot;
</code></pre>
while the fellowship is a grant not an investment nor loan, i cannot in good conscience even apply unless i will follow through with a startup that will not merely prosper, but be a huge hit.<p>given my fifteen years of adamant assertion that there is a better way than venture capital, while the fellowship would be good for me in so many ways, i would do right by others to demonstrate by my own example that that better way is self-funding.	2015-07-27 02:08:31 UTC		2

2932063	ask hn:  offer for talent acquisition.  need advice.	hello hackers,<p>i'm a relative newbie to programming and the startup world.  in early 2010 i launched my first product which also happens to be my first large scale programming project (i dont have a cs background). the product is a niche tool within the larger enterprise data management space. recently a prospect has been in talks with me to basically acquire me for talent.  they are actually not very interested in the ip, rather they like my experience around bigdata.<p>this is essentially a solo operation with 0 investors.  i have developed some partnerships to help me sell the product and i have a few customers (small deals) and a couple more in the pipeline.<p>my main motivation to even consider this opportunity is because the position they are offering me will allow me to experiment with bigger ideas in the same space (bigdata) and work with more seasoned programmers.  it also allows me to gracefully exit the niche category i was toiling in..<p>i'm torn between working within a larger organisation to try out my ideas or simply pivoting my startup into developing the larger ideas i have.  i know that i may be a bit thin on information and thats because we are in the early phase of negotiating a deal.  i'll try to answer your questions as much as i can.<p>so what do you guys think?  considering my background etc which way would you go?	2011-08-27 18:15:30 UTC		2

3116788	ask hn: how about an economy based on time?	i'm in no way a economist, not by uber long shot, but, i read about economic theories out of boredom.<p>i'll just pitch my insane idea for a new economic system. lets have an open discussion.<p>the current economic system is run by (mostly) meaningless numbers, that can be easily manipulated by people who understand numbers well. 
eg: you do work thats worth x dollars and get paid, and govt prints some bills, now your x dollars are worth x/(somefactor)<p>anyway, i'll come to the point, what if we managed to create an economic system that is based on a bullet proof system ever, "time".<p>time is the single unforgiving platform, that is common to all. nobody has one second less or more in a day.<p>by this system people gets rewarded, how efficiently they use their time. if person a creates x tool within 10 hours that was useful to 1000 people and person b creates y tool within 8 hours that was useful to 1500 people, then person b is richer that person a.<p>as weird as it may sound, based on my observations, all the rich/wealthy people care more about time, may be that is what made them rich in the first place.<p>why not bake it into the system, so, that everybody is encouraged to do more with less time and resources. (isn't that the definition of entrepreneur)<p>by rewards, i mean some system to keep track of the progress each person made, not necessarily money.<p>what do you think?	2011-10-16 07:21:38 UTC		2

1787494	ask hn: review my concept for an online court substitute	i'm in the very early stages of development right now, but with such a complex industry i thought it'd be good to get some feedback from hn.<p>circuit192 is simply an online arbitration platform. its a form of alternative dispute resolution that is usually legally binding.<p>to use the service, first two parties would agree to the terms of the arbitration. they then both submit a testimony and supporting documents to the service. we'll then select a professional from the appropriate industry (through linkedin) to fairly arbitrate the dispute. the point is to make the whole process as painless as possible, while still giving just and valid resolutions.<p>so what do you think? potential business or legal nightmare? (i'm leaning towards both myself). thanks in advance as always.<p>link: http://circuit192.austinbrandt.net/hn/<p>more details: http://austinbrandt.wordpress.com/2010/09/22/business-idea-voluntary-arbitration-network/	2010-10-13 15:40:24 UTC		3

7416770	ask hn: does spritz or squirt.io cause hypnosis?	has anyone noticed themselves going into a hypnotic state (or a state of trance) when using spritz or squirt for more than, say, 15 minutes?<p>i&#x27;ve been using the bookmarklet from http:&#x2f;&#x2f;squirt.io&#x2f; since it appeared here on hn. before today i had just been using it for relatively short blog posts and slightly longer news articles, but today i started out on a quest to read the whole new king james version of the bible in about 15 days at 950 wpm. (to filter out any distraction from outside my home office, i did this with some lyric-less trance music playing through my headphones.)<p>well, about 24 chapters in i was noticed i was un-ignorably hungry, (i skipped breakfast this morning,) so i paused the bookmarklet and set out to grab some lunch at chipotle, which is about a 10 minute drive from our house. i can&#x27;t adequately describe the feeling or experience, (i tried, but it ended up being long and crazy-sounding enough that i felt a bit self-conscious about it,) but having been hypnotized years ago i can definitely associated the overall experience with that of being hypnotized. (for folks who code, i&#x27;d describe it as being in the zone twice over. :-))<p>has anyone else experienced the same thing after using spritz or squirt for longer reading sessions?	2014-03-17 17:57:53 UTC		4

6412195	homeless but not hopeless	me and my sister are homeless, so we created an app in hopes of getting ourselves and family out of poverty. it took us about a year to do so.
we created a fun family friendly game with absolutely no death or violence, yet challenging and fun! with the idea of world peace and that everyone can just play together.
i believe that we are all equal, and that we just wear different hats :)
please feel free to check out our game, promise you it will be fun :)
here&#x27;s a video of us: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?feature=c4-feed-u&amp;v=liccqkf-m2k<p>gameplay of our game is also on our channel

3968634	ask hn: network for hackers without the recruiter spam? meet subroutin.es	http://launch.subroutin.es<p>i've heard from friends/colleagues that the problem they have with networks like linkedin is that while they offer news on events, articles and of course meeting interesting people, it isn't too long before they're bombarded with recruiter spam.<p>subroutin.es will put the programmers and technical people right where they belong, at the forefront. it will be a platform to share what you're working on and discover just as much. and if a recruiter does manage to sneak his/her way on, then enough reports will get them booted right off.<p>okay okay, not all recruiters are evil! the ones that provide value to the network won't find a hostile environment. there just needs to be a stop to being spammed with jobs that don't suit.<p>of course every dev has gotta pay the bills, so a gig/job board will be the avenue for those looking.<p>if there's interest in a network where we can connect with other techies and share what we're working on and arrange meetups without the above hassles then i'd love to release it.<p>i'm trying my best to follow lean principles by putting a launch page up and making sure something is built that people want.<p>if you want to be one of the brave that get early access to the beta and shape what you want it to be, then sign up!	2012-05-13 22:49:10 UTC		5
1026243	ask hn: what to focus on when pitching, product or underlying platform?	(note: this is my second try, rephrased and hopefully clearer, with a question i posted a few days back.)<p>i'm working on launching a startup based on a new computing platform developed by my co-founders. the platform itself is very powerful and flexible, and we envision it being used as a foundation for various different products and services, but we have decided to start with one product which is relatively simple to develop while having potential appeal to a wide range of end-users.<p>so, i'm really curious of the hn's opinion, what would make more sense to focus on when pitching to potential investors? on one hand the platform is where the power lies, but it might not be too obvious at once, especially to a non-technical listeners; on the other hand, it might be too easy to get lost in the specific aspects of this specific product. so, should we focus on pitching one, the other, or both simultaneously? or perhaps we should prepare two sets of presentations, depending on who we're pitching to?<p>to make things clearer, let's just say that the product itself is nothing particularly innovative except for its platform; something like google docs when compared to ms office.	2010-01-01 21:10:51 UTC		5

1435272	ask hn: dealing with news overload	i'm overwhelmed by the amount of news i follow.<p>tech news, local and global political news, staying current with science in general, and reading everyone's opinion on how to code, live and lead a company is... too much. i like to stay current, not only on topics relevant to work but also on generic topics on life, society and culture. however this is consuming too much of my time every day, and lately i've noticed too that it "trashes" my attention and capacity to focus, by littering my head with so much input. not checking my usual news sources makes me much more productive for the day, but builds an enormous anxiety to know "what's happening".<p>so my question is: how do you deal with this? do you just not follow what is not relevant to your current work, and disregard other aspects of what's happening in the world? postpone it to the weekend? do you know of a news source that is more "compact"?	2010-06-16 11:42:07 UTC		6

777813	why people complain about the quality of hacker news	after yesterday's _why backlash and the return of the erlang outbreak, i thought i'd point out why i think people complain about hacker news.<p>pg has basically said that he thinks the degradation of a site into crapville can be delayed or prevented by constant careful tweaking of the rules. somewhere behind the scenes, he's pulling the levers guiding his creation away from the obvious potholes that he thinks slashdot, digg, reddit, etc... have hit.<p>generally, we all feel some ownership of hacker news. we are submitting links, commenting and voting on submissions and other's comments. this is basically the only influence we have on the site. we each have a different idea of what an ideal hn would look like but in the end have relatively little control over it.<p>we use the few tools we have to register our disapproval. we down-vote people we disagree with. we cheer on and up-vote others who attack people we disagree with. we mass-submit stories to try to drown out the ones we don't like. we flame. while somewhat amusing, these are absolutely anti-social behaviors. they come about because we don't have other options.<p>one common response is "let me filter hn in x way" so that i can make it mine. there are a few custom views (i.e. classic) that have been played around with. if i were pg, i would resist this solution. i think part of what makes a good community is having a set of rules to deal with opposing views rather than tools to let them coexist like oil and water. a social common ground where ideas can mix. once you allow your community to fragment like that, the news stories submitted become defined by the boundary layer. if you allow people to filter, then you risk creating flamewars when the filters fail. the tone of the site becomes a contest to 'win' a point for your side; to break through other people's filters and taunt them.<p>in the end, i'm not sure what the right answer is here. one group of people thinks that articles about _why and zed are valid; one doesn't. if it keeps going, i think at some point pg will have to tell one group "this is not the site for you" by pulling a lever. until he does, people are left trying to fight to make this into the site they want with the few tools i have: bitching, retribution votes, flames, crap-flooding, etc...	2009-08-21 16:12:55 UTC		6

8008489	ask hn: what makes a great community?	i have small community of programmers on facebook, around 10,000 members spread across various groups and a few pages.<p>i&#x27;d very much like to bring the community to the next level, by way of its own website, with dedicated forums, chat, etc. i&#x27;d like to integrate this closely with the fb community so that there is little resistance in migration from one platform to the other.<p>my own platform gives me more flexibility in how i build and grow the community. i was just wondering what, in your opinions, make for a really good, great even, community?	2014-07-09 07:37:10 UTC		7

8324365	ask hn: should i take the “sponsorship” deal?	quick background: for the past 2 years i&#x27;ve been working on a project, a mobile app (google me if you&#x27;d like to see it for yourself, i don&#x27;t want this post to be an ad).  it recently got a considerable amount of traction. my next step for the product requires a few extra hands on deck and i need money for that.<p>so far i was reluctant to talk to vcs, because i&#x27;d lose some control and i&#x27;d have to deal with all the stuff i don&#x27;t want to (incorporating, papers, lawyers, etc.) instead of working on the product. so i came with an idea: since the app&#x27;s is a _bit_ hot right now and it has to do with finance a bit, i&#x27;d look around for a bank which would be willing to pay for the development in exchange for my project helping them strengthen the image of a bank that understands mobile and new technologies. i&#x27;d brand the app a little (splashscreen, link to their mobile app in the menu and a few extra sponsored features), i&#x27;d mention them whenever i talk to the media. so i contacted a few banks, met with some people and it looks like this thing might happen.<p>i also spent the last few weeks talking to a bunch of smart people about my project.  i figured i might learn from their experience and boy, was i right! i got a ton of good advice (and a lot of praises, which nicely tickled my ego).<p>the last meeting i had put a lot of question marks in my head, though.  i met with jacob krzych, ceo of estimote and an yc alumnus.  i got a ton of good advice (thank you, if you happen to read this :-) ), but one thing surprised me, he said it would be a great mistake to do the bank deal. it would be a distraction and i&#x27;d have to compromise the ui. i should talk to vcs instead.<p>now i&#x27;m torn... we&#x27;re talking about an amount that would let me hire enough people (4-5) for half a year but i have to agree that my app&#x27;s interface wouldn&#x27;t be 100% about the user anymore.<p>what do you think?	2014-09-16 13:32:09 UTC		7

3781636	ask hn: how to train your brain to recognize opportunities for innovation?	as a technical guy, i'm scared of the idea of being dependent on an idea-guy to come up with real-world problems to solve. i strongly believe that not only should i be able to solve problems through technology (or even simpler means, if you're into the whole lean current), but that i must be able to identify the problems themselves on my own.<p>the issue is that i have a very consumer-like mind and i feel i'm constantly missing out on opportunities to identify areas of improvement or disruption. as a silly example, i would have never thought of allowing individuals to be able to use credit cards for simple personal transactions (i'm referring to square), and yet it's such a simple and powerful idea.<p>how do i train myself to look at the world from the point of view of an innovator? how do i spot opportunities? any interesting books / internet reads on the subject?<p>i'm rather good at making things that others tell me to make, but i feel there's nothing as enthralling on working on a problem you yourself "discovered" and believe is really important to solve.	2012-03-31 21:45:03 UTC		8

929818	why i use a mac and not windows	i'm a front-end engineer with a side hobby in video production. i have a macbook for personal use. i use a high-end mac desktop at work. for my video editing, i use a high-end machine i built myself that has windows 7 on it.<p>on my macs, the system acts the way i expect it to. there are of course little ui things here and there that aren't exactly how i like to work, but leopard is very configurable and it only takes a couple of minutes on a new system to get it running the way i like. i am able to use virtualbox to run vm's of every operating system i have to test against, all in one machine. basically, the mac is sane. it lets me get things done that i need to get done. it also just gets out of my way and leaves me in peace.<p>i have a different relationship with my windows 7 machine. i chose to go with windows for my video editing for a few reasons. first, all of my video experience has been within the premiere/after effects suite. the latest versions of cs4 are really quite good. it was a relatively inexpensive upgrade to the latest versions that have better support for multicores and gpu acceleration.<p>cost was the biggest decision maker for me. i absolutely love the desktop mac pro i have at work, but i couldn't justify the cost of spending close to $3k on an equivalent machine for my hobby. i was able to build a high end desktop for about $1500, with 8gb of ram, terabyte hdd, dual video cards, etc. to top it off, when i built the machine windows 7 was available for free.<p>after many years of working with xp, win7 was a breath of fresh air. so much of the os was revamped. it got rid of many of the annoyances of xp, it runs so much faster. installation was a breeze. it had automatic support for some of my specialized hardware. to sum it up, win7 seemed like an automatic win, and indeed in many ways it was. for any average user, its a must-have upgrade if you're going to stick to the windows world.<p>but then, there's no point in writing this if i don't illustrate my frustration with windows 7 compared to my macs. its not a single thing that bothers me so much that i can just point at it say, "that's the reason!" rather, its a collection of many small things.<p>the best way to say it is that windows doesn't get out of my way. no matter what i'm doing, whether browsing the web, doing an application update, or playing a game, its always there in some niggling little way. it ranges from every time i install an update in firefox or chrome and the uac pops up and blanks out my screen to how the start menu works. the big thing that got me today was after manually initiating the windows updates, it politely downloaded them and asked me if i wanted to restart. i said, "no, but thank you. i'll do that later." so it goes away and i continue writing a rather lengthy forum post i had been working on. as part of that post, i had several tabs open where i had been researching parts of the answer i was working on. about 15 minutes after i said "no" to the restart, the os decides to install the updates anyway. without warning, it shuts down all of my open apps, logs out, and then reboots. it quickly reboots and does the updates, and is back on my desktop within a minute. the actual update experience is nice. the fact that is did so against my wishes is not. so yeah, i lost everything i had been working on. anger ensued.<p>so the point of all this is that for a product that has been tested, debugged, and gone through all levels of dante's circles and back before being released, windows is just <i>not good enough</i>. it seems like its so close. you just start to like it, and then it does something weird again. its like an old friend of mine. she drinks and can be really raucous. but she's a great person but has off moments. its like hanging out with her on a good day and everything seems awesome, and then she randomly punches a cop. you kind of expect it, but you let your guard down for a minute and then wham, you get reminded again.<p>i've basically come to the personal conclusion that an artifact really reflects the culture that makes it. clovis arrowheads tell us about the people in ancient north america. neanderthal burials tell us a lot about how they loved their families and friends. apple's culture is expressed in every product they make. they're sleek, well-made, and durable. they don't try to do more than they need. microsoft has their own culture, and unfortunately it gets expressed in even their best product offerings. the zune is a great mp3 player, but its 3 or more years behind the curve. the xbox is a great gaming machine, but the ui is both pretty and weird. ie8 made some big improvements, but their best effort just wasn't good enough. windows 7 is gorgeous, but the team behind it can't make it what it needs to be because its still a product of that culture.<p>so in the end, i just fell for mac because she's really my type of girl. we fit well together. windows is really pretty, and we have some good times, but she's just not the one. we'll still be friends, but that's all we can ever be.	2009-11-08

1253450	hn suggestion: give editors the ability to turn posts into comments	let's say someone posts a new bit of news "sun won't let you write jvm apps in closure any more." that's fine - it's a new bit of news that nobody has heard before.  there's space for that on hn.<p>however, some people then get really frustrated because there are thirty follow-up posts because joel spolsky has a post on that subject, and daring fireball has a post on that subject, and so do 28 people you've never heard of, but other people think that their posts are interesting enough to submit, and some people are so incensed about this that they're voting them all up.<p>so - here's a suggest solution.  let editors move these new posts so that they're comment threads under the original article.  so far as i can tell comments are basically posts that have no parent - so there's no reason why they couldn't have one assigned.  doing this could bump the original article back up the charts - but at least there'd only be one article for people to ignore.<p>the only problem i can think of there is that some over-zealous mods might move things that didn't actually need to be moved.  but that'd be an argument for the comments :-&#62;	2010-04-09 18:38:20 UTC		14

8637363	ask hn: dart's future	what do you guys think about dart&#x27;s future as a programming language of the web? i see a very bright future down dart&#x27;s long road but im also kind of worried about many of the ignorant people&#x27;s views about dart(ie java-like, made by google, competing with js(which it isnt)). if dart is implemented to google chrome(which is actually closer than you think) it will be a huge turning point for dart and hopefully other browser vendors will follow the lead. there is nothing but good with dart, its 2x faster than js, it outperforms v8 js engine and it has many packages being updated and created every day(see https:&#x2f;&#x2f;twitter.com&#x2f;dartcode for automatic pub package updates). it wont replace js, but it will be one of the big players(as it may be already) in web development. what do you think?	2014-11-20 18:52:12 UTC		14

582871	job: web developer for a new project by the guys who made facebook graffiti	we're a three-person startup looking for a great developer. we built the popular graffiti application on facebook (but we're not an "app company"), and we're working on a huge new project that's rewarding, interesting, and challenging. we hope it will ultimately improve the world a little.<p><i>we're looking for someone who:</i><p>- gets stuff done<p>- is a great web software engineer<p>- would enjoy building their own web framework<p>- has good ui sense<p>- can work in a startup (flexible hours, independence, pushing out features quickly, etc)<p>- wants to work on something fundamentally important<p>- cares about users<p>- hates most facebook apps, but thinks that building on top of the social graph has the potential to be powerful and useful<p>- lives near sf or is willing to move<p><i>who we are:</i><p>we're three guys who have been working together for six years. tim and ted (brothers aged 25 and 22) do web development, and mark (25) does everything from getting awesome advertising sponsorships to getting a meeting with just about anyone. we do all our brainstorming/decisionmaking/etc together.<p>we started in 2003 with booksoncampus.com and have worked on few other projects since then, but the graffiti application on facebook was our first big hit. we're now working on a new project that we're very excited about. we're keeping it a secret for now -- we wish we could be more open, but can't risk it in an ecosystem like the facebook platform where companies copy each other and can grow to millions of users in a matter of days.<p>graffiti and the new project are both built on the facebook platform, but we're not an "app company." we don't view facebook as a way to spam our way to success (graffiti is one of very few large applications that has never spammed or abused viral channels). rather, we've always been interested in creating and improving connections between people, and we think facebook is a powerful platform on which to do that.<p>we love what we're doing. we're driven to make our projects work, but other than that we're laid back. we're moral, fair, and honest, and we care a lot about our users.<p>we're not a yc company, but we happen to live/work in the "yscraper" and we're friends with a bunch of the yc guys.<p><i>what we're working on:</i><p>we have two projects: graffiti, and our new application.<p>graffiti is relatively mature. it has 2.5 million monthly active users and a strong community. it's profitable enough via brand advertising (dell, bmw, hp, microsoft, comcast, kohler, intel, ...) that we haven't needed to raise money. we've turned down several offers of vc money because we wanted to maintain long-term control over the direction of the company.<p>the new project, the one we're hiring for, is different from other facebook applications. we can't say much, but here's a little info:<p>- it's meaningful and could ultimately have a significant impact on the world.<p>- it's a huge project, but we're building and releasing it piece by piece.<p>- the part we've built is live, with thousands of users. it's looking quite promising.<p>- it's community-based. we have some experience with this from running graffiti, but getting it right is subtle and challenging.<p>- it's built with php, mysql, jquery, and facebook connect. we decided that existing frameworks (django, rails) ran the risk of becoming too restrictive for this project, so we went our own way. people love to knock php, but it's a pragmatic language for web applications, and if used right, its flaws are inconveniences rather than obstacles.<p>- the model is broad enough that parts are very abstract (e.g. we have a database table of database tables)<p>sound interesting? health benefits and stock options are included. email us: (hn.jobs.tmt@gmail.com). we'd particularly like to see what you've built before (either on your own time, or for someone else).	2009-04-28 08:19:22 UTC		15

911275	ask hn: how have you dealt with corruption?	a technical person at a potential large government customer of ours invited me to discuss our technology with him outside the office. this could be a red flag in itself but we had met twice before and i had learned that he graduated from the same school as i and around the same time i did and we knew some people in common. additionally, he had given me a paper of his to read which was pretty decent and said he would like feedback. in general, he seemed like an enlightened techie who was enthusiastic about our technology and technology in general. there seemed to be no red flags.<p>the first time i met him, we discussed his paper and our project in general and he was generally encouraging, saying his organization could be very bureaucratic but he really believed what we were doing was the future and he would pull for us. he also indicated he was stifled in his job and would be interested in working for us in the future. this was a bit of a red flag but considering our connections outside of this project, it seemed like it could be an innocent thing. i told him that if he decided to leave his employer he should let me know and that we were at least a few months away from thinking seriously about hiring someone with his skills.<p>when i met him the second time, he out and out suggested that we pay him to push our project through and, when i told him his employer would most likely find that objectionable, he suggested various ways of hiding it. i was too shocked to say anything, afraid he would sabotage us if i said no to his face and insulted him and the only thing i could say to him was that my cofounder is very by the book and i really have to run it past him and that he should double check to find if it is actually allowed.<p>i have no intention of paying him or dealing with him again, but i feel dirty for not telling him off on his face. i am just posting this here to vent and see if anyone else has faced similar issues. how did you deal with them? any advice for me?<p>how could i have handled this better? i am asking this seriously. although i did not do anything wrong (or so my partner tells me), i feel that not doing anything more assertive than what i did was wrong. :(	2009-10-30 00:46:25 UTC		91

1546065	ask hn: have you met emeri gent?	a fairly regular commenter on my blog, has dropped serious philosophical flow comments on some of my simple posts. i really appreciate his stuff and thought some of you may as well. many of his comments are far more interesting than my original posts. here's one of his latest comments:<p>one of the reasons "viktor ovurmind" works for me is imagination and exploration. today i added "rupy yuan" into that future mix of my personal explorations, because it is good to try things and see where they fall, but this would be anarchy if it was simply a random event. so our imagination has to find the poetic and whatever that poetic is how we learn to escape structure and yet at the same time find new structure in the escape.<p>many major innovations occur when people have gone outside their field of expertise and therefore appreciated a different way of doing things. an example of that would be toyota creating a part of its core philosophy from watching how supermarket is run. then there is simply stuff which is just off left field such as einstein imagining himself following a beam of light.<p>where i come often unstuck is premature conclusion and in arriving at a conclusion, i have killed off any possibility for imagination and exploration to work on me. sometimes "that working on me" can be a painful process and sometimes blind chance of serendipity. however it works is not for me to conclude but the moment i have arrived at a conclusion, i am working from that point onwards with dead ideas, or even ideas that might have found their way into my life simply through recency or exposure.<p>i look at music as a great example of a form of imagination that is based on a core of basic notes but which can proliferate into so many forms and different ways. that is why some people liken the move into the information space as the new punk rock or rock'n'roll of our time. it is then whatever way we put it together.<p>i think a reason why premature conclusion is more common rather than the birth of something new, is perhaps attributable to the way we preconceive what innovation should be. indeed our society is obsessed with innovation to the point we probably kill the goose that lays the innovative golden egg. in my own pursuits i am apt to utilize different exposures to music as means of surrendering the logical and structures of reason, without expectation of a pay-off or a discovery. by not wanting something to happen, the opposite seems to occur.<p>linkin park is a good example of musical form which can stir my mind to take me away from the literate forms or any professional habit i have acquired that subjects me to a more fixed way of looking at things:<p>in between
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omiurjdodye<p>what i've done
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzuo_uobpua<p>somewhere i belong
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ictpuqvydk<p>when i lay out this music in this way, i am simply appealing to the poetic within me. if there is nothing poetic within to resonate beyond regular behaviour, then i am wasting time and i should really apply to walmart and live the rest of my days stocking shelves, but if there is an even a hint of the poetic to fuel exploration, then the output is pure imagination. when we try to forcefit someone else's formula or ideology or theory into something that we have not found within ourselves, then we are clones and imitators and there is no difference to this way of being than applying for a dead-end job.<p>ultimately, the way we organize work, whether it applies due process such as agile or feature creep as described above, a new way of working is often just on the other side of the fence. one way of looking at work is how film is made. i am often left in wonder how a hollywood film project costing millions of dollars can assemble a wide diversity of talent, find a common moment on their schedule, deliver a self-contained project and at the end of it, go off in their different merry ways.<p>whether it is the infinite possibilities in music or the creative chaos of making a blockbuster movie, everything begins with imagination and exploration that is not simply a bus load of blog comments all tripping off a linear reaction of awareness. that is why my most stark suggestion is to ignore what it is i say but decide yourself what the fruits of your imagination will be.<p>that our thinking becomes relative is simply a courtesy, an etiquette and a respect which is an important dynamic of how we co-exist together, yet our imaginations are only limited to the extent we are able to handle the liquor of our own imagination and how we turn that fuel into a life worth living. if we cannot make that form of life for own given selves, we cannot do it for another - we can only give as much as we gain, and in imagination, it is how we approach this because it is central to our own dna, rather than simply what it means or what its worth as an investment in drawing a premature conclusion.<p>one of the things i love about coming to victus spiritus is it provides a lot of white space that seeds my own imagination. i much prefer to observe my "emeri gent" emergent form of writing as akin to a mission impossible tape. having thought this, hopefully these ideas will self-destruct, but the residue of that is an intelligence called my own learning and personal discovery. imagination therefore isn't something one can program, it is merely something one can develop by learning how to be generous in its movement and application.<p>[em]<p>the comment link: http://www.victusspiritus.com/2010/07/22/great-software-is-measured-by-how-little-it-constrains-human-imagination/#comment-64100570<p>more of emeri on disqus: http://www.disqus.com/emerigent/	2010-07-25 18:43:29 UTC		1

3019859	ask hn: netflix vs. qwikster and the justification	i read apple outsider's "what netflix could have said" which argues the uses of dvd and streaming are separate.  but i argue, for the common user, they are very similar.  the common user wants access to content on their terms not those of the studios.  given release x, if i want to see it, i want it when it is available for method y.  if y is streaming and z is disc, i would prefer that such are basically in the same time frame.<p>the biggest issue with, and one i have a problem, streaming netflix is "available content".  most things i feel like watching randomly, take conan the barbarian, as an example, aren't available.  this is a movie from the 80s.  20+ years ago, available?  nope?  why?  licensing reasons.<p>i am both a netflix disc and streaming user.  explain to me how the above will be solved?  if anything, we are seeing a retrenchment in streaming content.  i expect to see less for my money.	2011-09-20 22:24:09 UTC		1

3550245	ask hn: what has been your experience with spine.js?	i am a big fan of strong conventions, and no waiting for interfaces.  i've never used a js mvc framework before this project, and have been starting with backbone.  its been a little bit frustrating in the amount of boilerplate, and general lack of conveniences-- such as for handling ajax updates and form submissions with a minimum amount of work.<p>has anyone really pushed the bounds on spine.js, and seen what happens?  how quickly is that point reached where the library just doesn't do what you want?  how easy is it to build on when that happens?<p>thanks!	2012-02-04 04:33:41 UTC		1

4394711	ask hn: tips on raising money for dev bootcamp	hi hn,<p>i'm in a predicament. after many interviews and a lot of waiting and wondering, dev bootcamp emailed me and said, "we loved meeting you. you're in." i'm super excited! but now i'm faced with a fast-approaching deadline to generate $20k ($11k for tuition and $3k/mo for living expenses in sf). this is the next phase of my project: raising the funds. i'm ineligible for a school loan, because dev bootcamp is a company, not a .edu institution. i'm also ineligible for a private loan because i'm 23 and i have no assets for collateral.<p>i've turned to raising cash from friends/acquaintances. parents aren't in the picture. to date, i've raised $9k, which is super, but i'm not even half way there, and i think it was just due to a mixture of beginner's luck and the great amount of enthusiasm and conviction i conveyed during my pitch. i'm still pursuing the fundraising route (and i also began a project on invested.in here =&#62; http://inv.st/27n). the adrenaline and social aspect of raising money and being persuasive is addicting. i feel very entrepreneurial. one year ago, i could never have fathomed having the capacity to raise this sort of money. but my leads are running dry, and i'm not sure what to do next.<p>i wish there was a sort of yc entity for people who want to get an unofficial education. dbc isn't a real school, so financial aid and grants, etc. are inapplicable. maybe there is such a thing, and i don't know about it. is there?<p>does anyone have any light they can shed on what my next step should be? also, if you're feeling philanthropic and you'd like my wells fargo checking account number, i'm happy to provide that too. ;)<p>thank you, all.<p>nima<p>ps: do you guys think it would be inappropriate to cold email paul graham and ask for his financial help? after all, he's always pushing the philosophy that he invests in people, not ideas or plans.<p>any wisdom is deeply appreciated. there's nothing i want more than to attend this program.	2012-08-17 02:04:12 UTC		1

425668	ask hn: what would you want (or not want) on a dead-simple free niche jobs site	i"m interested in creating a free job listing site for a specific industry that currently doesn't have one.<p>what should it do?  what should it not do?<p>things i'm fairly certain it should do:<p>-popular listings should be visible immediately on the front page.
-no images, just text and very few graphics.
-listings should be free.
-users should be able to flag iffy-looking listings.
-there should be search.
-jobs should be browse-able by location, type of job, experience level and compensation.
-users will be able to tweet out a job listing, e-mail it to a friend or bookmark it using other services.<p>things i see on the pay sites that should be left out:
- letting job seekers post their resumes
- message board
- industry news and gossip
- industry event listings
- weekly news letter with editorial content on the industry<p>things i'm on the fence about:<p>- rss feeds for sub-sections of job listings
- e-mail alerts for new listings in keywords the user wants to track
- a customizeable widget that people can embed on their sites with the latest listings.<p>there are 3 sites currently focused in on just this industry.  one charges $80 per listing.  another charges $250.  the other is $150.  when i talk to friends in this industry, the default that everyone goes to is the $80 site.<p>thoughts?  am i already doing too much? too little?	2009-01-08 21:23:30 UTC		1

3762542	ask hn: digital agency stuck in 1st gear	hello,<p>i have a small profitable digital agency (me and sub-contractors) on the west coast that i am trying to take to the next level. i'm at a tipping point that i feel could really help the growth of the company but i find myself being a bottle neck in many areas. i'm an engineer and was wondering if it made sense for me to look for a partner that has complimentary skills such as design and business development. maybe i should look for a partner that has engineering skills such as mine so i can focus on sales and project management? anyone been in this position before or have experience in growing very small companies that can share what worked for them, etc?<p>also, where would be a good place for me to look for potential business partners? i have used craigslist for finding talent but it's so hit and miss. is there a site that can pair up people that are serious about working together?<p>thanks	2012-03-27 16:57:33 UTC		1

5519821	anxiety while programming	hi,<p>i don`t think i am cut out to be a programmer (electrical engineering background), i got moved from a role where i was performing support &#38; operations into a programming role after a bit restructuring.
the group is pretty hostile (though highly experienced), and will comment when tasks are not completed fast enough. we are not really a team, everyone eats lunch at their desk or with other groups and people raise their voice frequently (and management does nothing about it...i think they see it as passion).<p>we are using agile where we time-box everything and commit to its delivery. and if i say a task needs to take 7 days, the team will say no, it should take 4.
after 2 months of struggling to deliver (working weekends but still delivering in the ehnd) i couldn`t take the constant anxiety attacks, i checked my blooodp ressure, and it`s very high (160+/90+)...and i am 28, turning 29 this year.<p>i went to the doctor, and got prescribed anti-axiety medecin, which is actually an anti-depressant (citalopram).
it's my first days on it, i feel mellow and i no longer feel my heart pumping away while i am sitting on my desk, though i think it is affecting my decision making (causes drowsiness) and it has slowed me down considerably.<p>what should i do ?
others with similar experience ?
am i not cut out to be a programmer (or at least unable to become a good one -- i feel its almost like i am allergic to it, even though i like the "idea" of becoming a professional programmer) ?	2013-04-09 17:57:40 UTC		1

2040245	advice for a computer science sophomore in college?	hi everyone!<p>i'm a sophomore in college majoring in computer science and math. i have always loved programming. i started programming in c when i was nine years old and over the years i've picked up visual basic, c#, java, c++, javascript, objective-c, python, ruby, elementary haskell and elementary erlang, and i learned perl back in the day which i've mostly forgotten.<p>i have not done much network programming. i have done cgi programming, but that was about six/seven years ago. i've done some socket programming and written (school) programs to do interprocess communication, which i understood and liked. i'm taking a course on client/server programming and another one on network security next semester, which i am really looking forward to.<p>i'm seeking advice on how to proceed with future learning. i've mostly done application (mobile and desktop) development, not much of web development. i'd like to pick up some web development this coming semester. since i know ruby and python, should i start by learning django and/or rails? any other suggestions on starting web development? i have a good understanding of html and css.<p>also, i'd also like to know how hard it is to pick up and be good (read: productive) in functional programming languages coming from a purely structured/object oriented background? i've been reading up on erlang and haskell, and i'd like to know your opinions on whether it's worth my time trying to learn them. what about lisp, scheme and other functional languages?<p>any help/ideas would be really appreciated.	2010-12-26 07:19:10 UTC		2

1592480	looking for a technical cofounder	hey all,<p>i've recently come up with what i think is a fun/interesting idea for an ios/android app.  its not something that will make us billionaires - but i think it would be fun to build and would very quickly become profitable.  the app/idea solves a problem for a large and growing market and has a definite built-in audience.  there are already competitors but they aren't very good and don't really capture/display the information in a functional way.  i'm sorry that i'm probably sounding cagey/shifty, but truthfully i think its something that would be really easy to build and a great, marketable product.  with some of the programmers here i have little doubt that we could have it built and live in a month after a couple of hours a week of work.  enough of the preamble, here's the idea.<p>on the backend:  we extract location and timing data from schedules or twitter feeds -&#62;  we use locations to "pin" those things on a map.<p>as for the app:  on startup we check the user's location then display (on the same map) the pins closest to them.<p>there's a bit more i've worked out as far as design, implementation and extra information that we would want to provide, but essentially thats it.  i'm looking for anyone with great skills/experience and an interest in food (of any type), slight preference might be given to folks in boston and/or la but thats only so that we could chat/work in person.  everything else can be done from wherever and on whatever schedule you'd like.<p>if you'd like to chat, drop me an email (joshua.snyder(@)gmail.com) or post a comment, i'm looking forward to it.  i think this project could be pretty interesting, a lot of fun and rather quick to complete.<p>josh	2010-08-10 18:30:43 UTC		2

8429113	ask hn: building a secure laptop for sensitive work data	due to recent events at my work i now have a need for a secure laptop for sending and receiving sensitive data to clients. i&#x27;m going to buy a laptop for use when working on sensitive data but i need help on setting it up with the right tools and configuration.<p>i&#x27;ve read a couple articles and done some preliminary research so i have some ideas. i&#x27;m not interested in trying to use tails. here&#x27;s what i have so far:<p>- debian os
- tor browser
- pgp encryption of all outgoing files and emails
- some kind of full-disk encryption (truecrypt?)<p>i have two questions as well:
1. if i travel with the laptop and airport security asks for my password to unlock fde, is there anyway to protect against being forced to give them the key?<p>2. how should i transfer files to and from the laptop? usb key?	2014-10-08 19:59:45 UTC		2

3398682	letter to straighttalk	i purchased phones through straighttalk for my wife and i several months ago and have been very happy w/ the service received until now.  i’ve been waiting for straighttalk to come out with an android or microsoft phone that i liked so i could upgrade both my service and phone.  unfortunately straighttalk has been slow offering android choices and no microsoft at all.  i did not like the android straighttalk offered, and chose to go with virginmobile while leaving my wife’s phone with straighttalk.  she was happy w/ it and i saw no reason to change.<p>i purchased the virginmobile phone and requested a number port approximately 2 days before my straighttalk phone went inactive.  straighttalk took longer than normal to port the number and i called virginmobile after 3 days of waiting.  virginmobile contacted straighttalk and verbally requested a port but they refused saying my phone was now inactive, so they would not be porting the number even though the request was made while the phone was active.<p>i called straighttalk myself and spoke with an advisor but she and her supervisor both refused to do the port.  i realize there are company policies, but policies are just guidelines.  i’ve worked in retail long enough to know there are situations where it is more practical both from a customer service standpoint and a monetary standpoint to not follow policy.<p>because you were both slow in performing your responsibility in porting my number and showed poor customer service by not relenting from your company policy you are not only losing my business but i will be changing my wife’s phone to another carrier as well.<p>from my viewpoint you have driven away two happy customers for not performing a service that probably would have cost you only a few minutes of an employee’s time and possibly a couple of minutes air time to do.  sounds like corporate greed to me………….	2011-12-28 05:04:28 UTC		2

1621465	could steve blank have saved my last startup?	about 10 years ago i was working for a development house that built sites for some well known companies, like egg and lastminute.com. but i wasn’t on those projects. i was project managing the build of an employee benefits platform and this particular afternoon found myself in a the board room of a well financed start up with an address close to buckingham palace. picture the scene as the newly appointed, and rather aggressive, ceo/bulldog circled his board whilst smacking the soot blackened fire poker into the palm of his hand. menacingly. actually i’m not sure that you can do that without menace.<p>he was enquiring as to why, after spending £2m, they still hadn’t released a complete offering. he turned to me and everyone else around the table breathed a sigh. i ventured that it was probably because the specification was limited to four screen sketches. this for a site that had many layer of user interaction, and at least 40 separate pages.<p>at this point two things happened, firstly the sky outside darkened, and secondly the product owner seemed to slide down his chair heading for the safety of the space under the impressively robust mahogany board table.<p>i turned to my boss, and in retrospect this may have been a mistake, told him to finish the biscuits because i didn’t think that we would be invited back.<p>i wish i could have suggested that we took a step back, spent the weekend getting familiar with “four steps to epiphany” and regrouped in few days. but to be fare, steve hadn’t written his book at this point.<p>so now i’m the guy charged with defining the product, for a our startup, gruvi. we are one of the 10 teams in the startup bootcamp http://www.startupbootcamp.dk/ program in copenhagen (which is a nordic take on y combinator or tech stars). i don’t have a fire poker so i’m hoping to discover our product by connecting with potential users. we’re not fussy, we’ll take anyone that is familiar of with the concept of going to the movies with friends.<p>to see a little more you please watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw-qrttdizg (i’m the rather unimpressive guy sporting way too much forhead).<p>if you are interested in engaging, and i hope you do, you can find us at any of: guineapig@gruvi.tv,

2665353	ask hn: your “simpler than i thought” epiphanies with computers	i have had a few epiphanies when it comes to my understanding of computer systems that encouraged me to explore something that i had previously found intimidating. i am curious as to what other areas i would explore after hearing others’ epiphanies.<p>an example – the command line. being part of the “point-and-click generation,” i became much less intimidated by the command line once i began thinking of the command line as a text-based file manager, and once i knew that most of the commands were actually the filenames of executables placed in the directories named in the path environmental variable. before that i didn't think that the command line dealt primarily with something as familiar as directories and files, and i didn't know that you could start any program from it. i thought that i very likely would fubar the computer if i explored it.<p>another is communication by applications over the internet. in an argument on irc about which was the best web browser, someone humourously suggested telnet. that made me curious, so i searched the web and found this[1] web page. it made me realise that most, if not all, connections over a network made by applications are basically two-way streams of <i>linear data</i> – two lines of one’s and zeros, and that many of these streams could be read as plain text using something like telnet. after that i began exploring other protocols as well with the aid of this[2] wikipedia article.<p>[1] best viewed with telnet to port 80:

9411398	ask hn: should i learn aurelia?	apologies if framework paralysis is a tired subject, but i&#x27;m at cross-point where i need to make a career oriented decision in the framework im going to choose.<p>right now, aurelia looks like it hits all the right points, and it appears to be built in a way that just makes sense and is future forward.  that said, its still so new, and does not have the same kind of exposure to employers that ember, angular, and react do.  ive already eliminated react, despite its acclaim, because i actually am looking for a full mvc-like framework as i don&#x27;t have the background in application development to know what to do with all the other pieces on my own. im coming from a &quot;brochure website&quot; background, and have been stuck in cms hell for years modifying html, css, js, and hacking at php because ive never wanted to learn it, but most cms demand it.<p>ive been looking at job listings for front end devs and see some employers asking for existing experience in angular.  backbone is mentioned almost as often, but i have not seen many asking about ember, and none as of yet asking about aurelia experience.<p>i know i&#x27;m not going to be a pro in any of these frameworks for at least a year, so i&#x27;m kind of leaning towards aurelia and crossing my fingers that when i arise from the documentation and feel confident within that framework, aurelia will be more mainstream.  at the very least i consider it a good start to get my hands dirty with es6.<p>am i crazy to try and learn aurelia at this point as a career oriented decision?	2015-04-20 23:14:36 UTC		5
672225	ask hn: entrepreneurs, how do you get introductions from investors decline?	i'm currently raising money from investors for my revenue-generating startup. i've reached out to all the angel and vc investors i know, and whenever someone declines, i ask for introductions to other investors they know - this process has resulted in exactly zero introductions.<p>this morning i heard from angel investor david cohen, to whom i had sent my executive summary "over the transom" (i don't know david and had never been in touch with him prior to sending him my exec summary) - he had said it wasn't a fit, so i asked for introductions as usual. here is what he said:<p><pre><code>     i can't do referrals - they'll just ask why i'm not investing and it won't help you.

     brad feld has a good post on why -&#62; http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2007/11/dont-ask-for-a-referral-if-i-say-no.html

     i am always happy to look at potential deals. thanks.
</code></pre>
(that third line was in response to me asking if he'd like me to introduce my entrepreneurial colleagues to him when my colleagues are seeking funding - by the way, though david wasn't interested, i very much appreciate his welcoming of executive summaries, and his quick replies - if you are raising money you should contact him)<p>brad feld's article summarizes why david cohen, brad feld, and presumably most other investors will not make introductions to other investors for deals they decline. i didn't realize that this "no intros if i'm not interested" policy was so widespread.<p>thus my question: have any of you entrepreneurs been successful in getting introductions from investors who decline your deals? if so, how did you accomplish this?	2009-06-24 15:26:46 UTC		5

8641223	ask hn: would you pay for revenue forecasting? if so, how much?	i recently worked in a small consultancy with a mix of employees and contractors. both have advantages: employees are cheaper with higher margins, but you pay them from day one whether they work or not; contractors can be paid when you are, but for this you pay them more.<p>forecasting each month&#x27;s &quot;free cash&quot; was a major challenge: with enough cash and a good prospect of a long-term gig, we could hire an employee. otherwise, a contractor.<p>accounting packages don&#x27;t help: they track actuals and generally work on an accrual basis. the balance for a month is not just cash on hand but cash plus receivables.<p>i could not find a forecasting system suitable for a smallish consultancy. there are systems for larger firms ($$$) and for manufacturers, etc., but not for us.<p>i created a too-complex spreadsheet to get us kind of close: one sheet per worker with formulas to calculate actual current expense vs actual current cash on hand, free cash, etc.<p>by adding sheets for prospective workers, i could determine when we could hire them, how long they could sit on the bench (some people you don&#x27;t want to pass up), what bonus structures might work, etc.<p>i&#x27;m back on my own, don&#x27;t have that problem anymore, but thinking we cannot have been the only company with it.<p>would you pay for a forecasting service? add entries for workers with daily rates&#x2f;salaries, expected expenses, etc. the system would project expected cash for any period and allow you to play out scenarios (can i hire bob on dec 1st and alice on jan 15th?).<p>i&#x27;m thinking of starting with a free app using local storage so users can get value without registering, but at the price of always having to use the same browser, same machine, with no export capability, no sharing, etc.<p>paid services could include cloud storage, access from multiple devices, have multiple editors, ability to limit people to roles (to be defined), export to csv, accounting packages, etc.	2014-11-21 13:51:04 UTC		5

2739073	a great use for g+ hangouts	when google+ finally goes public, one thing i hope stays is the hangouts. it would be awesome too if even people who don't have (and probably don't want) a google+ account can be involved in them.<p>i'm sure the smart folk over at googleville are working on ways to make this happen and i for one am eagerly looking forward to it for one reason alone:<p>it will be the first mass-market way to have a face-to-face conversation with anyone in the world.<p>if you make video calling as easy as email, everyone will be at it!<p>what does this mean? well the expected increase in social activity through this online social network is a given. but i have higher hopes.<p>i think this would be a great way to communicate with our customers! i envisage a time when we can see when a person is visiting our website and we can invite them to chat face-to-face.<p>no platform currently has the power to enable this because they are locked in to having registered users and installed applications - two big buy-in steps that put most users off!<p>but if google can implement this right, we could see the next generation of ecommerce exploding in front of our faces.	2011-07-07 16:19:51 UTC		5

144197	how is your refactoring done?	i've done plenty of refactoring in my code (usually c++), but i'm still hesitant to invest in tools to help.  i limit myself to global "find"; even doing global replacements cautiously, one by one.<p>i think it's because i can't imagine a tool being able to handle all the "quality" aspects of large scale code changes.  for example, a symbol browser might not see #ifdef'd-out blocks; a parser may find references to x in code but not in comments; and aesthetics like proper indentation may be lost.  in other words, if i let a robot "fix" things and move on, i may be burned down the road by confusing code or comments.<p>are there good refactoring tools that i've just missed?  how do you handle major code changes?	2008-03-24 00:37:45 UTC		5

4955016	ask hn: android dev blogs?	i'm primarily a web developer but have been moving slowly into android over the last year.  i have some great java and android resources -- they're readily available -- and follow a few blogs, like the official google android dev blog, but i think it'd be great to find some more android app- or game-centric resources.<p>do you follow any active android-specific bloggers?  are there watering holes frequented by these mythical beasts?  are you in fact an android?<p>i've read and revere o'reilly's <i>programming android</i> and love mario zechner's <i>beginning android games</i> as a reference on all sorts of game-related topics including efficiency and gc avoidance.  the indie game dev scene is awesome, but i seem to be missing out on the part that concentrates on android... am i just a failure at the internet, or is this a segment that keeps to itself?<p>any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  thank you!	2012-12-21 23:11:25 UTC		6
6298606	ask hn: what do webdevs do for additional money?	some of my mobile developer friends make handsome additional money with their smart phone apps which they develop in their part time. although i can develop smart phone apps, but i am far more comfortable in web development. so i was wondering if similar possibilities exist for web developers to make extra bucks.<p>for example, recently i heard of a freelancer who made a million with a wordpress theme:
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;propakistani.pk&#x2f;2013&#x2f;08&#x2f;13&#x2f;pakistani-freelancer-sells-1-million-worth-of-items-online&#x2f;<p>similarly, facebook games could be another dimension but i am not sure of that.<p>i am not looking for a million dollar idea, but something that could make a modest amount (around a thousand bucks a month) will be nice.<p>any ideas&#x2f;experiences will be much appreciated. thanks!	2013-08-29 21:03:35 UTC		6

6506103	ask hn: what does it mean to be happy at work?	i have a background that includes working at small businesses, my own startup and most recently, f500 companies. i feel like i&#x27;m always on a roller-coaster of highs and lows, things that i need to accept or risk getting into political trouble, and the inability to call out failures, when we run into them. so, i thought i&#x27;d ask you all how others feel at work and what&#x27;s considered good &#x2f; bad &#x2f; normal.<p>what does it mean to be happy at work? is it basically tuning out, punching a clock in exchange for a pay check? is it doing everything possible or just meeting expectations? are you truly vested in your work and the company&#x27;s success? or, do you just make sure you always have a lifeboat in case things go wrong?<p>thanks,	2013-10-07 01:08:09 UTC		6
1860407	ask hn: pg for president?	<i>i wrote this before i remembered pg is from england and thus can't be our next president... but maybe others can suggest someone else that could make the next election different.</i><p>in two years from today, i would vote for pg if he was running. i've never met him, but through his essays, hacker news comments, and the stories of all the successful (and not successful) startups out of y-combinator he has won my vote. i have always voted republican (which i know is rare in hn land) and i don't know where pg stands on all the party lines, but it doesn't matter to me anymore. both sides have failed us. is he pro-life? no clue. that use to be something that would influence my decision, but not next time around. would he be good with international relationships? it doesn't matter. he would build a great team that could handle the areas he was weaker in.<p>in 2012 i want to vote for someone that can be trusted, a teacher, and an entrepreneur. i want someone who can guide the small ideas that are usually lost and turn them into grand works. i want someone that can create actual jobs and focus on what is important. i want our government to use technology instead of restrict it. i want someone that not only can conceive that government can be efficient, but also actually do something about it. i want someone that doesn't put on a show, but rather shows us how we can succeed.<p>can pg do all that and more? i'm not sure, but he would have my vote just so i could see him try. what do you think?	2010-11-02 13:57:57 UTC		6

3916412	ask hn: canadians, is rogers throttling your connection?	lately it seems my internet service has been cut dramatically.  nearly all downloads are slowed to 100kb/s.  i used to be able to pull down 2mb/s, it's definitely a large drop (20x).  i can no longer play youtube videos without halting to buffer every 20 seconds.<p>the canadian internet situation seems to now be in very dire shape.  we have a duopoly in control over all communications in the country, and they are now throttling down our connections while increasing our bills, and not improving (even decreasing) our service.  i have been at a 95gb/mo cap for over 5 years now.<p>i blame the canadian government and the crct for this situation.  the telecommunications industry in canada is a public cartel that clearly does not have users' quality of service in mind.  the government is clearly working toward tightening controls and maximizing profits for rogers and bell.  i just wonder when this madness will end?	2012-05-01 21:18:26 UTC		8

        music&#x2f;

  documents&#x2f;

1652664	thinking about making my table-top rpg an ipad app. looking for advice.	i wrote a fantasy role-playing game called wayfarers a couple of years ago, and have been selling pdfs and hardcopies of it and supplements since. it’s more of a hobby than a business, but one that i plan to continue for some time.<p>after playing with the ipad, i think it would be awesome to rewrite the book as an app. tables in the book could randomly generate results, and characters could be built. also, i could update for errata and new features and material.<p>i don’t think i could make much money, but i am really excited about the idea, and i think it would be a lot of fun.<p>i have all of the art and text ready to go, but my programming experience is limited to some fortran and matlab for physics research years ago.<p>how difficult of a task am i looking at here to teach myself how to build the app and do it? i’m considering teaching myself, but i have other projects in the works. if i were to pay someone to do it, what kind of time frame could i expect?<p>any advice at the moment would be appreciated, as i am trying to figure out the best way to make this happen. i’m convinced that this is going to be the future of tabletop rpg material, and it would be so cool.<p>thanks,<p>-jimmy	2010-09-01 13:13:05 UTC		10

705070	ask hn: potential interest for new hacker house in redwood city	we find ourselves in a situation where we either need to move in august, or we need to find new room mates for our house.<p>there are six or seven rooms, depending on how we set things up, and three of us (a yc company) who are hoping to stick around. we thought we'd reach out to the hacker news community to see if anyone was interested in moving in and forming a "hacker house" of sorts.<p>price depends on how many people, and also we're hoping to renegotiate our lease after it expires, but it would probably be in the $800-$1000 range. the home is very large, with two rooms dedicated to office space, one of which is completely open right now. the bedrooms are available immediately.<p>the house is located in redwood city, off woodside road. it's walking distance to plenty of food, but not quite walking distance to caltrain (biking distance to caltrain and palo alto). there's a big kitchen, huge living room (part of which could also fit desks), two fire places, back yard, dedicated parking, in a very quiet neighborhood, good for hacking. comes with a hammock too.<p>if you're interested, post below or send an email to: newhackerhouse@gmail.com. we're happy to send photos along, and will probably post some later.	2009-07-15 03:21:05 UTC		15

65940	pump and dump	this appeared on craig's list<p>what am i doing wrong? <p>
okay, i'm tired of beating around the bush. i'm a beautiful 
(spectacularly beautiful) 25 year old girl. i'm articulate and classy. 
i'm not from new york. i'm looking to get married to a guy who makes at 
least half a million a year. i know how that sounds, but keep in mind 
that a million a year is middle class in new york city, so i don't think 
i'm overreaching at all. <p>are there any guys who make 500k or more on this board? any wives? could 
you send me some tips? i dated a business man who makes average around 
200 - 250. but that's where i seem to hit a roadblock. 250,000 won't get 
me to central park west. i know a woman in my yoga class who was married 
to an investment banker and lives in tribeca, and she's not as pretty as 
i am, nor is she a great genius. so what is she doing right? how do i 
get to her level? <p>here are my questions specifically: <p>- where do you single rich men hang out? give me specifics- bars, 
restaurants, gyms <p>- what are you looking for in a mate? be honest guys, you won't hurt my 
feelings <p>- is there an age range i should be targeting (i'm 25)? <p>- why are some of the women living lavish lifestyles on the upper east 
side so plain? i've seen really 'plain jane' boring types who have 
nothing to offer married to incredibly wealthy guys. i've seen drop dead 
gorgeous girls in singles bars in the east village. what's the story 
there? <p>- jobs i should look out for? everyone knows - lawyer, investment 
banker, doctor. how much do those guys really make? and where do they 
hang out? where do the hedge fund guys hang out? <p>- how you decide marriage vs. just a girlfriend? i am looking for 
marriage only <p>please hold your insults - i'm putting myself out there in an honest 
way. most beautiful women are superficial; at least i'm being up front 
about it. i wouldn't be searching for these kind of guys if i wasn't 
able to match them - in looks, culture, sophistication, and keeping a 
nice home and hearth. <p>* it's not ok to contact this poster with services or 
other commercial interests <p>postingid: 432279810 <p>the answer <p>dear pers-431649184: <p>i read your posting with great interest and have thought meaningfully 
about your dilemma. i offer the following analysis of your predicament. 
firstly, i'm not wasting your time, i qualify as a guy who fits your 
bill; that is i make more than $500k per year. that said here's how i 
see it. <p>your offer, from the prospective of a guy like me, is plain and simple a 
cr@ppy business deal. here's why. cutting through all the b.s., what you 
suggest is a simple trade: you bring your looks to the party and i bring 
my money. fine, simple. but here's the rub, your looks will fade and my 
money will likely continue into perpetuity...in fact, it is very likely 
that my income increases but it is an absolute certainty that you won't 
be getting any more beautiful! <p>so, in economic terms you are a depreciating asset and i am an earning 
asset. not only are you a depreciating asset, your depreciation 
accelerates! let me explain, you're 25 now and will likely stay pretty 
hot for the next 5 years, but less so each year. then the fade begins in 
earnest. by 35 stick a fork in you! <p>so in wall street terms, we would call you a trading position, not a buy 
and hold...hence the rub...marriage. it doesn't make good business sense 
to "buy you" (which is what you're asking) so i'd rather lease. in case 
you think i'm being cruel, i would say the following. if my money were 
to go away, so would you, so when your beauty fades i need an out. it's 
as simple as that. so a deal that makes sense is dating, not marriage. <p>separately, i was taught early in my career about efficient markets. so, 
i wonder why a girl as "articulate, classy and spectacularly beautiful" 
as you has been unable to find your sugar daddy. i find it hard to 
believe that if you are as gorgeous as you say you are that the $500k 
hasn't found you, if not only for a tryout. <p>by the way, you could always find a way to make your own money and then 
we wouldn't need to have this difficult conversation. <p>with all that said, i must say you're going about it the right way. 
classic "pump and dump." 
i hope this is helpful, and if you want to enter into some sort of 
lease, let me know.	2007-10-10 19:43:02 UTC		16

4197561	ask hn: i could really use some help and/or advice	hello hacker news community,
i'm very hesitant to write this post, but i'm at my wits end. i'm living in the western us, and am in my late 20's. for the last couple of years, i've been rejected from what feels like hundreds of jobs and come in second place about a dozen times. i have an extreme visual impairment. not quite blind, so i've found it difficult to get assistance from government agencies. transportation is a huge issue, and i ultimately can't even apply for many jobs because of driving requirements and other problems relating to terrible vision. unfortunately, moving to a better place (like the bay area, portland or seattle) isn't an option due to expenses. most it jobs here require driving, so they're out.<p>as a result of this, i have been doing any work i can find available online. this includes writing work, transcription (which i just started trying to break into), and even small coding jobs. i've done some terrible jobs in writing and coding--creating product reviews for things i've never used, and other 1 cent-and-below writing assignments. i've done basic content scrapers and other stuff that i'm pretty sure is just used for spam. in the past, i've also done general it work and other such tasks.<p>i'm not asking for handouts. but would like to know if anyone around here may have any work for someone like me. i'm literally up for any task (aside from design, for obvious reasons), and i'll work my ass off for you.<p>my hope is to find enough work to sustain me, and save up a bit for business lisence fees as i start ios app development and start work on some website ideas.<p>if anyone has gone through anything similar or just has some general advice i'd appreciate any words of wisdom. working from home, i don't socialize, and would also just appreciate some email exchange or any other interesting talk.<p>feeling so lousy for such a length of time has been really tough, so i'm just trying to reach out to a community that has given me a lot of inspiration and hope. i share a love of computers and technology that i know many here have.<p>thank you all for reading. i hope that this post isn't inappropriate for hn.<p>my email address is in my profile if anyone wants to get in touch.	2012-07-04 04:14:48 UTC		23

9741836	ask hn: has political correctness gone too far?	it feels as if there is a mob of silent assassins lurking on twitter and media outlets looking to out anyone who says anything that isn&#x27;t glowingly politically correct. they are sort of like &quot;political trackers&quot;, except they are targeting mostly white, male programmers - but in reality - anyone who disagrees with their narrative (whatever it is) is a heretic.<p>i find it offensive that there are claims of sexism in oss and tech. codes of conduct. i feel like i can&#x27;t give an opinion, or even make a mistake speaking without being stared down or ruining my career.<p>i don&#x27;t want to be politically correct. but it looks like they only way to survive is to be that.<p>am i the only one who feels like outsiders are assaulting tech for their own selfish agenda, and we were already diverse by design decades ago?<p>someone decided to flagkill what could otherwise be a constructive discussion: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=9738526, https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=9741640<p>interestingly, that is an example of the kind of censorship that is taking it too far. i would like a discussion to happen and this not to be censored. use an anonymous account so you can speak your mind without being persecuted.	2015-06-18 21:53:20 UTC		32

460693	ask hn: is a team of work-at-home employees realistic?	hi everyone,<p>i was wondering what you think about the feasibility of building a team consisting of employees who work at home. i don't mean a completely remote team;  i am talking about local people, and certainly with some measure of face-to-face meetings and physical interaction when that level of collaboration is required.  i just mean people who work mostly at home on a day-to-day basis.<p>as far as i can tell, corporate america is mostly terrified of telecommuting.  admittedly, it can be legitimately said to pose some very real management challenges.  but no matter how much i consider that, i just can't see a justification for paying for office space and forcing people to spend time there for 8+ hours a day.  i think i agree very strongly with what pg has had to say on the topic of corporate office space and its relationship to talented individuals and their productivity.<p>i agree that it's harder to manage remote people, and i've certainly taken stock of the allegedly widespread tendency for remote workers to take advantage of their independence and lack of direct oversight.  and lack of consistent and direct communication can certainly be an obstacle.  but i think there are technological solutions to these problems:  better backoffice tools, better collaboration and messaging tools, voip, instant messaging, presence, good ticketing and workflow management systems, etc.  i think the technology is there to make up for the shortfall.<p>now, admittedly, the angle from which i am approaching this problem is a little bit orthogonal to the typical dilemmas of web startup entrepreneurs.  i am 23, and at the moment, i am trying to grow my voip / telecom systems integration and engineering consultancy beyond a one-man show so that i can get to the point where i can be a product company.  in other words, i suppose it's fair to say i am taking the "consulting route" that pg speaks of in his various essays on startup funding.  good, bad, i have various reasons for that, but the goal in the end is to end up with actual "deliverables" - no mistake about it.<p>still, the reason i mention that is because consulting is a business model that lends itself to measurement of individual productivity a bit better than, say, a software startup.  product development and engineering - pure capex, none of which is directly rebilled or amortised any way (especially in a short time to market) - is a little more murky.  and certainly, there are some business models where almost the entire risk can be shifted onto the employee, as one sees with commission-only work-at-home salespeople.  in my case i think i'm in a happy middle.<p>regardless, i'm not going to go all japanese quantitative management on people.  i want to build a progressive and humanity-affirming company where people are happy and proud to work on interesting problems in the telecommunications space.  i am just wondering if i am being too idealistic here about remote work;  are people just going to take advantage of me, in the main?  or is it reasonable to suppose that i should be able to afford them the benefit of working wherever they want as long as they meet certain criteria as far as productivity, availability, and good communication? (all my prospective employees are excellent written and verbal communicators, and i would not have it any other way.)<p>i am in atlanta, a city notorious for its vast, empty suburban sprawl, unconscienable freeway distances, and gridlock traffic.  i really, really don't want to compel anyone to trek through this disaster of urban planning and infrastructure design to my office if there is no real point.<p>does anyone here have experience building a team like this?  if so, can you share tips on what strategies you used to make it work better?<p>thanks a lot!	2009-02-01 08:16:04 UTC		33

8560110	ask hn: network of successful individuals	hello fellow hn members,
summary: i have seemed to grasp hold of a viable startup, it has very minuscule traction &amp; growth as of right now, after putting up the beta version i obtained 30 paying users without a dime spent on marketing. i built a subscription based model for the “pre-startup,” anyways, i am positive the startup can grow &amp; scale quickly but with some resources. 
the dilemma:   i do not have any real mentors or access to successful individuals yet, &amp; i feel like waiting for an incubator&#x2f;accelerator is a waste of precious time.  what do you recommend i do? digressing, i believe the benefit of joining a reputable incubator such as yc or techstars is actually not the money at all, it’s the mentorship &amp; network of 24&#x2f;7 grinders. i believe successful companies have access to high quality mentors, &amp; can grow quickly with the advice provided. 
(extra) i built the pre-startup by myself &amp; do not have any friends that are interested or have any connections in building a startup. i also just graduated a university &amp; have attempted to gain contacts but there was an absence of entrepreneurship.
before you answer please don’t tell me the following because, i have attempted these tasks &amp; i concurred that they are a waste of time.
-“meetup groups,non-ivy universities without a real entrepreneurial background, co-founders lab, score… etc…
thanks,
your fellow hn member.	2014-11-05 01:43:36 UTC		1

3637842	pyreqauth - python web auth decorator	ever get sick of this pattern in your web app?<p>if &#60;user exists&#62;:
.. do something with user
else:
.. show error message or redirect user to login<p>over and over and over again in your routing handlers?<p>with a bottle.py example: what if you could just tag your handler with a decorator like this:<p>@bottle.get('/magic/resource/&#60;resource_id&#62;')
@require_user # &#60;-- this is the awesome magic
def user_account(user, resource_id): # &#60;-- the 'user' arg is provided by the decorator
....# notice the user object is automagically available
....return "hi %s - welcome to resource %s" % (user["name"], resource<p>similar to tornado's web.authenticated decorator, but my version has some advantages:<p>1) framework agnostic
2) the decorator takes arguments to allow for customization
3) you can adapt my pattern to make your own "require resource" helper - (heck i can change my project to simply help with "require resource", but i hate generalizing code so much no one knows what to do with it anymore)	2012-02-27 05:03:22 UTC	https://github.com/anthonywu/pyreqauth/blob/master/reqauth.py	1

10105299	ask hn: how to improve our api's documentation	hello,
we have an rest api that have been in use internally &amp; now we have started opening it for our partners.<p>i have done the initial documentation by parsing our server logs to get the params, then tried the requests in postman. once i had the params &amp; responses, i documented them on http:&#x2f;&#x2f;developers.punchh.com&#x2f;<p>now, 
the docs there are 90% correct but sometimes they are out-of-date, wrong or have grammatical&#x2f;typos in them which i fix but there is little bandwidth. i am wondering if i should outsource this work to technical writer(freelance&#x2f;contract) to make sure api docs are solid as the will work on it dedicatedly vs my team who&#x27;s primary focus writing code.<p>however, i am still not sure if this a good idea. how do other companies make sure that their api documentation is awesome? looking for some advice on how to improve the api docs to they are easier to read:<p>url: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;developers.punchh.com&#x2f;	2015-08-23 11:55:36 UTC		1
8862331	can i get feedback on my parallax, responsive, static gh-pages website?	i want to get better at creating highly-performant, responsive websites. i work with a great group of engineers but we only know as much as we know. i am hoping someone might offer some constructive criticisms on a website i built so that i can, frankly, just get better!<p>www.benjaminbuckingham.com<p>here&#x27;s some info about the website:<p>* github pages: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;gregm&#x2f;benjamin-buckingham-dot-com
* parallaxjs for fancy animations
* also using keyframe animations
* picturefill for responsive images
* google fonts for better design
* mediaqueries at a few non-standard break points
* i cut the images myself and tried to balance file size vs user perception of quality
* i didn&#x27;t use a sprite and am wondering if i should.
* i should probably minify the css and js.<p>thanks ahead of time!	2015-01-09 14:30:50 UTC		1

3763024	ask hn: would you be interested in startup month?	just few week back, i have attended startup weekend and got amazed by kind of learning experience and networking opportunity it has provided. i have made some good friends and build an application in just over a weekend. 
but it got some drawbacks as with other hackthons. i.e. there is no call to action after the event and the time line is much shorter to build anything serious.<p>since then i am thinking about online version of this process which could carry over a month and participants can work partime whole month from their home.
more specifically, we will be having an online platform where participants from whole world can collaborate,comeup with ideas, brainstorm, vote and call for people with required skills set to build the mvp.<p>to test the core assumption of idea itself, i am thinking to build this online platform and minimum
tools required over a month using this process.
so i require web developers, designers, idea-tors, marketers, mentors and anybody who want to contribute to project in one or other way.
if interested, please send me an email at saathi@gmail.com stating role you want to play and number of hours you can put per week for a month.<p>currently, this idea is in very nascent stage and
require your criticism and suggestions to improvise.<p>please up-vote to spread the message.	2012-03-27 18:48:07 UTC		1

2864419	a question on startup's stages and lifecycle	hey hners, 
wanted to tap on the vast experience here in creating a startup via building a product.<p>i have decided to quit my full time job for a bigcorp, move to india (citizen) and start working on an idea full time, along with a co-founder who will be located in usa. my co-founder is at this time is contributing part-time. he will be keeping his job (safety net for investment). 
this is our first time endeavor into a startup. 
our idea is still very rough and would evolve as we build the product (as expected). right now we just have quick proof of concepts and simple functional prototypes.<p>i had a few questions, that i am hoping some of you could shed some light on:<p>- we are not planning to register our company yet, as we don't have a mvp. the plan is in the next 6-8months we can churn out a beta and then try to register the company (in usa). we do have our domain parked though. is it normal for a startup to just go with a domain as its identity or do you folks register a company when you start off? we don't plan to put much on the website anyway until the beta.<p>- at this point our venture is completely self funded. in fact the cost to build is mostly the cost in terms of our time. does this make our venture as a pre-seed startup? i am a bit confused about the startup stages jargons. is there a definitive guide to it?<p>- is it a good idea to keep track of expenses (assuming labor is also an expense?). will it help in evaluations?<p>- what is the lifecycle most of you have seen with a startup? as i understand -&#62; 
	1) conceptualize 
	2) create a minimum viable product/service 
	3) self-promote, word of mouth via networdk about the product. gather some userbase (paid preferrably).
	4) for expanding, look for funding either from angel investors or seed investors. yc is another option if we can make the cut. 
	5) ...
	(any step or order that i am missing?)<p>- other than putting in more than 18*7 hours of work into building the product, most of which will be time spent writing code, is there something else to know and keep in mind? some process that i am overlooking?<p>- we are users of what we are building and find a need for a product like this. our current market research is based on how to plug the void that is there today. we are also actively looking at current players in the market, identifying their strenghts and weaknesses. we plan to ask our friends to help test stuff as we build and get their feedback constantly. are there other ways of doing market research? is it even worth it?<p>cheers!	2011-08-09 15:44:50 UTC		1

7160767	ask hn: should i trust my partners?	i started a project with two others, one business dev and the other a designer.
me being the sole dev have been working long hours to complete both backend and frontend for private testing.
recently i discovered my partners have been working on another project with other devs, without any attempt to communicate this to me. they both say this other project is not going anywhere.
should i be concerned about this partnership? this has left my with a bad taste since hearing it. development have been the bottleneck that have required the most effort so far, betrayed is something i feel like describe my feelings right now.
what would you do in this situation?<p>edit:
in thinking about it more, there was a disagreement on approach early on, i wanted to take it slow, and the buss dev wanted to go more vc growth route. thinking back this probably was an indicator that it was in his best interest to be involved in as many projects as possible.	2014-02-01 03:50:48 UTC		1

3902242	xamthone plus sembuhkan luka diabetes melitus	a&#62;di tengah perkembangan zaman yang seiring dengan perkembangan dunia pengobatan medis ternyata belum juga menemukan obat-obatan yang bisa menyembuhkan penyakit yang bernama diabetes melitus (dm). tetapi hari ini di indonesia telah ditemukan sebuah nama obat herbal yang mampu menyembuhkannya, dia adalah xamthone plus sebuah keajaiban manggis.
adalah rozaq (57) seorang peternak ikan asal pare, kediri, jawa timur, mengalami kesembuhan secara ajaib dari penyakit dm yang dideritanya. “luka dm-nya sangat parah, membusuk dan dokter sarankan untuk dipotong,” ujar fauzi, seorang pelanggan xamthone plus yang melakukan therapi penyembuhan dm untuknya.
selama belum minum xamthone plus, bukan saja lukanya yang parah, kondisi badannya terus melemah, akhirnya dia sering tidur. namun setelah minum xamthone plus, dalam 5 hari keadaannya mulai sedikit demi sedikit berubah. badannya mulai lebih segar, lukanyapun mulai sedikit mengering. “setiap pagi saya bersihkan lukanya,” lanjut fauzi.
ketulusan hati seorang fauzi dalam merawat rozaq dengan menggunakan xamthone plus, ternyata diberkati oleh allah swt. hari ke-10 lukanya semakin mengering dan mengecil, hari ke-15, hari ke-20, 25 sampai hari ke-50 akhirnya sembuh juga. lukanya sembuh dan rozaq bisa duduk dan berjalan kembali. sebuah proses kesembuhan yang ajaib mengingat dm merupakan penyakit yang belum ada obat yang mampu menyembuhkannya. teks : kp. foto : fauzi.	2012-04-28 06:54:46 UTC	http://agenxamthoneplus-bandung.com/xamthone-plus-sembuhkan-luka-diabetes-melitus/	1

87771	email hijacking	a lot of sites seems to have users sign up using an email address and password and nothing else. the admirable goal is to minimize the friction in signing up.
but it seems like that can invite a pretty serious issue that i've been callling "email squatting".<p>the problem is that these sites don't verify that the person who signed up with a particular email address is, in fact, the legitimate user of that email address.<p>consider someone signing up with my email address: foo@bar.com. now i'm not going to be able to use that email address, because it is already taken. worse, if messages to that account, such as invitations, the attacker can accept them, since they typically see the invitations on the site in addition to it being sent to the email address.<p>as the legit user, i might see the invites, but won't be able to log in at all. worse things can happen: once the attacker signs up, they could make this email address secondary and add another, primary address so that they see all of the messages.<p>here's a solution:<p>rather than asking for an email address and password on the front page, have a "try it" button and a box for the user to enter an email address. when they click on the box, the system sends email to that address with an "signup" link, signed with an encrypted hash of the email address.<p>when the (legit) user clicks on the link, they come back to a signup page, the system checks the encrypted hash and we're good to go.<p>i realize this adds another step, but the hijacking problem is real. for sites dealing with any sort of sensitive information, it needs to be dealt with.<p>are there better solutions that have less friction?<p>or am i just being overly paranoid?	2007-12-10 13:23:27 UTC		1

5507892	shocker, i need start up money for business (human services winner) :)	i want to obtain start up money for a business in ny.  nys is changing from state run facilities for people with disabilities, to private facilities.  they plan to do this in 2015.  the kicker is, the private agencies are already turning people away due to lack of space in 2013.  i want to create my business to partner up with one of these non-profits and create assisted living facilities on a 90 acre spot in oneida, ny (it used to be an old golf course).  i'm envisioning multiple unit housing facilities within close proximity to each other.  even if medicaid funding wasn't involved (which it will be as this is the norm for folks with disabilities), the rental units alone could bring in well over $100,000 per month (and that's just renting 100 units or so).  i hope to use the entire section of land, and have many different types of facilities on it (i.e. swim therapy at onsite pools, exercise area for occupational and physical therapy needs, onsite psychologists, onsite nursing facilities, etc.).	2013-04-07 17:28:33 UTC		1

6240908	ask hn: do you work for any of the included companies? (dell/hbgary/at&t/etc)	a recent discussion on endgame systems[1] with a user here yielded an interesting result, defense of the company by virtue of the commenter working at a similar unnamed entity. some time later a thread here on snowden&#x27;s husband was being flagged, evident by it&#x27;s sinking rank yet simultaneous rising votes and valid commentary.<p>this led me to wondering a few things, first: what number of users here are embedded at companies like endgame systems, saic, hbgary[2], google while receiving monetary remuneration for work rendered. second: what are these users feelings on the end result of their labor? drone strikes, renditions, exploits used on dissidents, airport terminal blackholes, destructive malware aimed at dangerous industries like iran&#x27;s nuclear program. have they been forced to defend involvement in these things to themselves even if only for being an at&amp;t technician maintaining installed hardware? or do they find themselves responding with flagging articles they have probable conflict of interests in?<p>the short of it: what is their rationale for being complicit in these times?<p>companies one may find themselves to be employed with, posted from barret brown&#x27;s[3] project pm[4] and telecomix&#x27;s bluecabinet[5]:<p>hunton &amp; williams,

but then, realtime will still be a problem in garbage-collected languages?<p>on the other hand, new frontiers will open up, there will always be applications where you want to go even smaller and then you still want to use resoruces sparsely.<p>is it a good choice for an engineering student to get into embedded systems today ?	2012-07-05 17:30:17 UTC		2

6756578	ask bitcoin exchanges: where are the ips of the buyers/sellers from?	calling all bitcoin exchanges (or equivalent places of purchase like coinbase):<p>it would be very insightful if you could provide aggregate analysis on where the buyers and sellers of bitcoins are from.  could you provide a blog post on this (likely using ip address-to-location lookups -- unless everyone is using tor to purchase their coins).<p>given a recent spate of articles on china&#x27;s growing interest in bitcoin, many of us are hypothesizing that the recent appreciation is in part due to chinese demand.<p>then there has been bernanke&#x27;s statement lending credibility to the currency.  that could result in more traditional investors finally taking the plunge.<p>since there haven&#x27;t been that many new merchant&#x2f;places to spend bitcoin added in the past 3 weeks, the appreciation is almost certainly a signal of speculation (which we all know). what would be helpful is to know who these speculators are and how the makeup of bitcoin investors is changing through time.	2013-11-18 20:06:08 UTC		3

7192457	ask hn: how does google maps transfer '0 byte' images on street view?	i was reading the answer to this question http:&#x2f;&#x2f;stackoverflow.com&#x2f;questions&#x2f;8072921&#x2f;chrome-dev-tools-size-vs-content on stack overflow about &#x27;size&#x27; vs &#x27;content&#x27; on the network tab of chrome, and the accepted answer said:<p>...<p>&quot;size&quot; is the number of bytes on the wire, and &quot;content&quot; is the actual size of the resource. a number of things can make them different, including:<p>* being served from cache (small or 0 &quot;size&quot;)<p>* gzip encoding (smaller size than content)<p>* request&#x2f;response headers, including cookies (larger size than content)<p>* redirects or authentication requests<p>...<p>so i was a little surprised when i was checking the network tab on a typical street view page on google maps and observed that the size of almost every tile (jpeg) was 0 but it wasn&#x27;t being served from a local cache nor was it gzipped.<p>here&#x27;s what i see (note 6th column, size&#x2f;content): http:&#x2f;&#x2f;i.imgur.com&#x2f;vpenusc.png<p>how is this happening, how can the file they transfer be 0 on the wire but definitely have content (as indicated) without caching or gzipping?<p>i&#x27;d love some more clarification if i&#x27;m misunderstanding something obvious. thanks!	2014-02-06 19:39:47 UTC		3

(http://stoptweet.com) we didn't like any of the applications that were already out there.  they were all too complicated for the average twitter user.(or maybe we're just dumb)...regardless, we made the application to do what others don't. it allows you to create your own settings and decide what spammers look like to you. the application is extremely easy to use, and allows you to only block who you want to block without hassle. on top of all this, it's free. most of the apps we found charge a monthly or yearly fee. we do not.<p>please let us know what you think, all feedback is appreciated. (and greatly needed as we have no friends to critique us)<p>thanks.	2010-02-08 04:20:34 UTC		3

5775837	ask hn:  how to learn through freelancing?	i want to become a full-time ruby on rails developer.  i've read things like this (http://www.quora.com/ruby-on-rails/what-are-the-minimum-level-of-skills-for-an-entry-level-ror-job#) that range from as little as throwing a few sample apps on github to joining a programmer school.  however, it may be hard to be motivated to build a few sample apps that have no users, and i don't want to move far away to attend one of these schools.  another option i've thought about is freelancing on sites like odesk or elance to learn through experience.  i'll have real problems to solve, and i can do it from my current location.  i could do freelancing for 6-9 months to prepare a portfolio to get the full-time gig.  the freelancing only is needed to provide significant experience; i'm not expecting much money out of this.  i've got the savings to cover the living expenses.  if you've attempted to learn via freelancing, did it work?  what were the pitfalls?  i can see one issue being that a lot of these online freelancing websites have a lot of people applying for the jobs so it may be hard to get them as a beginner even with some sample apps	2013-05-27 18:20:47 UTC		4

5654736	why don't we developers care about accessibility?	in a prevoius project i became aware of the lack of respect in web development for people with disabilities.<p>i had the experience to come in contact with users that had reduced visual perception. it was an eye opener in many ways, especially as former sinner.<p>we needed to adopt our product to meet requirements for visually impaired users and it was a huge undertaking on an old product. even if we fixed all bad markup, the bigger problem was workflow and page composition.<p>too many pages had too much information to usable for user with a screen reader. if the screen reader reports 200 links on page, which one to open if all of them do totally different things? just "reading" all of them takes a very long time and if the context of the link is always changing to different logical tasks.<p>and often the workflow to get to the correct context involved popups, mouse hovering, drag and drop and other bad design choices. even for a normal user.<p>usually the argument against making pages accessible is as follows,<p>* adds extra effort<p>* complicated<p>* hard to know correct solution<p>* screws up the design<p>i would argue that if you think this thru from the beginning and takes into account when doing the design, your general workflow will improve for <i>all</i> users, because you avoid the complicated solutions.<p>the irony is that myself is visually impaired with mild colorblindness, but i really never thought about it before that project.<p>here at hn the login name in the upper right corner is written in green on an orange background. i can't read that. its just a blur and cause eye irritation.<p>in my opinion, accessibility should be part of the curriculum in computes science courses.<p>but even if you do, you need to get developers to enjoy solving this problem. most developers don't care when you mention it. maybe because they don't see it as a technical problem.<p>what do you think?	2013-05-04 11:36:13 UTC		4

1149402	10 points for brushing your teeth	points for toothbrushing: the gaming speech everyone is talking about<p>people keep tweeting and e-mailing... did you see this speech? yes, i saw it. this is today's must-watch about the future of gaming — and the future of life.<p>carnegie mellon assistant professor of entertainment and technology, jesse schell, tore down the house at the dice summit last week in a half-hour presentation about where games are heading, beyond consoles and beyond even the current gaming phenomenon, facebook's farmville.<p>the hook behind farmville and so many other popular games these days is authenticity and reality, schell argued. he said the leading trend is games "busting through reality," denying the old notion that gaming's best attraction is fantasy.<p>the idea of games being part of the real world is what's taking hold: games that have you jumping around in the real world, games that have you connecting with people in the real world. facebook gaming, in particular, is a key attraction for this kind of play that more and more people are discovering that they want. playing a game in which you're outscoring your friends — not people you meet on xbox live, but your old college roommate you've friended on facebook — is the undeniable lure. mix that in with achievements for ... everything. (memories of the so-called world of chorecraft.)<p>so where does that take gaming? and life? if you're short on time, go to the 20-minute mark.	2010-02-24 22:34:57 UTC	http://kotaku.com/5479125/points-for-toothbrushing-the-gaming-speech-everyone-is-talking-about	5

4927832	solution hn: patent trolls	big companies have the pockets to fight or pay patent trolls but what should smaller companies do to combat this problem?<p>the problem is not with the trolls but with the system that can't gauge the enormity of the problem because the hundred thousand dollars a small company loses never blips on the radar. but what the system doesn't realize is that this has been hurting so many people from so long and needs to end.<p>the system and its rules aid the trolls in this extortion and the only solution is to unlink our companies from the system that (unknowingly) aids them in this extortion.<p>how do we do it?
incorporate offshore in some tax haven, make the local business a cost center that does contract work for the parent. now the patent troll has to route litigation to unfavorable places without systems to aid them in their extortion and cannot pursue litigation without resorting to costly measures. once the cycle of easy money is cutoff, and since they are not viable businesses themselves, they will be starved and will die a painful death.<p>but the intention here is also to transfer the pain points from us to elsewhere. with this structure, businesses will start saving taxes through the new route and now the system is the one losing money instead of the small businesses. this jolt will definitely wake it up from its s;umber and will make it fix the menace.<p>maybe this is dumb and you have a better idea. please share it so that we can put an end and not some politician.<p>we are hackers and we'll find a way to kill patent trolls today in hn.

1650898	uses of implicit differentiation	hello hn,<p>i have now gained an intuition of solving a simple equation involving implicit differentiation.example x^2y = 5 where y is considered to be a function of x even though it's not quite obvious.(it's not explicitly stated like y = f(x).)in this case we proceed taking the derivative using the power and the chain rule.my question is what is this implicit differentiation all about?i tried doing a google search on this but couldn't find a convincing article.wikipedia too starts off with the definition of it which i couldn't understand.neither of the two talks about the practicle uses of it.
i'll be really happy if someone could explain this concept in detail.so far i've been blindly solving problems involving this technic<p>thank you	2010-08-31 21:18:21 UTC		6

8247426	ask hn: sound-based syntax highlighting – what do you think?	hey,<p>i want to drop here an idea that is bouncing in the back of my head for some years already, and that i absolutely, positively won&#x27;t have time to test in upcoming months.<p>we all have experienced the benefits of syntax highlighting in our editors. apart from increasing readability, it helps spot typos the moment they&#x27;re made. i bet most of us have internalized it into an almost subconscious reaction like &quot;hey, that keyword i just wrote didn&#x27;t turn blue, i must have made a typo&quot;.<p>i was thinking about using sounds to achieve a similar effect. say you&#x27;re typing a keyword, the moment you type the last letter and make a whitespace, your editor plays a sound. you expect it to be played, so if you don&#x27;t hear, you immediately know you&#x27;ve made a typo.<p>one could introduce different sounds for symbols, numbers, strings, opening&#x2f;closing parens, and maybe even bigger semantic constructs. you get slightly different sound when you close a function, when you close a class, etc.<p>one would have to make sure those sounds are non-distracting. fortunately, one is rarely annoyed by the sounds of one&#x27;s own typing the keyboard makes, so this suggests it is possible to achieve this goal.<p>one slight twist i though about is to make every keystroke make a sound, with a pitch increasing with the speed of your typing, to make people like typing faster more :).<p>the simplest way to test it would probably be to write an emacs exension, given the great facilities this editor has for plugging into the typing process, including recognition of semantic constructs. unfortunately, as i said, while i&#x27;m dying to test this, i have other projects right now and a thesis to finish; maybe someone will give it a shot though.<p>still, i&#x27;d appreciate any comments regarding use of sound as an additional sensory input to a programmer&#x27;s brain.	2014-08-30 20:04:50 UTC		7

4095720	i would like to outsource development but can't break the mental barrier	i've outsourced all kinds of things.  from accounting to graphics sound production for games.  code: never.  why?  i have a mental block preventing me from taking that step.  how are you doing it.<p>i've hired many in-house programmers in the past.  i've had the good, bad and ugly experience.  as a coder myself, i recognize that in some of the bad cases i should have been more involved in the hiring process. too busy running other aspects of a manufacturing business at the time.<p>i've also seen productivity issues first hand.  hell, i have productivity issues of my own.  we are only human.<p>and, lastly, i've had work flat out stolen.  after about six months i let go a marketing manager who had been in charge of developing our website.  he went to work for a competitor and had them hire my (freelance) web developer to duplicate all of the internal and external functionality that we spent a year developing and fine-tuning.<p>i am no-longer in manufacturing.  my new world is 100% software-based.  and i have tons of projects i'd like to tackle.  i can't do it all myself or in-house.  but, when i think about the idea of outsourcing development i get images of my past experience that are keeping me from pulling the trigger.<p>i keep reading about people doing this here on hn and other sites.  i can't, from my current vantage point, possibly imagine hiring someone clear across the world to, effectively, hand them my ideas and have them built.  this isn't a case of american egocentrism at all.  i am very well travelled, multi-cultural and speak a few languages.  no issues there.  i guess it boils down to trust.<p>how do you do it?  does one just jump in to it with a degree of innocence and hope for the best?	2012-06-11 17:25:36 UTC		10

3141753	ask hn contractors: do you charge to write a spec?	i've been involved in the contracting market for the last couple of years.  lately i've seen a big uptick in large (100+ hour) projects with bad or nonexistent specs that want pricing information.  3-page "outline" specs, specs with ridiculous requirements obviously written by clients (100% uptime), etc.  there's grey area too--i often see specs that need a 25% or 50% rewrite, or need a few features reworked to be feasible.<p>i'm concerned that writing the spec needed to eventually determine the pricing information is a bad roi vs, say, writing actual code with my time instead, working on paying projects, etc.  at the same time, nontechnical clients don't always understand why they need a spec, or don't understand why the spec they have is bad, or why i can't determine pricing information from it, and usually the trust isn't there at that early stage of the pre-relationship to convince them.<p>what do others in the contracting market do in this situation?  do you just invest the 10-20 hours in speccing all the projects, do you tell them to come back with a spec, do you offer to do it hourly?  how does that conversation usually go?  where do you draw the line between free and paid work?	2011-10-21 21:18:16 UTC		10

1. technical book authors who want to self-publish their next technical book
2. bloggers who want to make books out of a curated and edited subset of their blog content<p>we support writing in html and markdown: html is good for bloggers, markdown is good for technical book authors.  we also support external code samples for markdown books with a simple syntax.<p>in both cases, authors edit their books on their own computers, in a folder that we automatically create and share with them via dropbox.  to produce a new preview or published version, authors just click a button on leanpub.com.<p>we recently pivoted to using dropbox for all books, instead of our previous two approaches of supporting an in-browser book editor (it sucked) and git integration (it was elitist).<p>we finally feel that we have a coherent product.  we still have a lot of work to do, but we wanted to get some feedback.<p>thanks	2011-03-15 21:07:43 UTC		13

7773379	ask hn: is this sponsored weeklong "hackathon" actually exploitation?	bemyapp advertised a week long hackathon 
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;hackerisland.bemyapp.com
recently and i applied. a week in a nice hotel on an island and hacking on fun stuff sounds great.<p>now they would like me to participate:<p>=====<p>here, are some additional information on this hackathon :<p>- it will take place during the edenred annual meeting with 200 managers from 40 countries.<p>- the aim is to select 13 designers and 13 developers who will work in teams with edenred managers in order to implement a new dynamic for innovation<p>- there will be 13 teams. each team will be composed of 15 people : 1 developer, 1 designer, 2 team leaders and 11 managers<p>- as a member of your team, you will participate in choosing the theme of your app<p>- teams will be divided in 3 sub-groups :
group 1 : mock up
group 2 : benchmark – market study
group 3 : commercial pitch<p>- 1 appointment per day will be scheduled with john and pierre from bemyapp to help you<p>we are looking for autonomous designers and developers who can work in team and adapt quickly. indeed, most of the managers have never taken part in a hackathon and some of them don’t really use mobile applications!<p>as we want to take care of you and want you to have fun we have booked a 5 star hotel for the whole duration of the hackathon with a private beach and a swimming pool. on top of this, the 26 participants will win a pebble watch and the winning team will win 4000€.<p>=====<p>i&#x27;ll be the only dev in a group of 3 to 5 building a mockup. at hackathons usually at least half the people are devs.
i have the strong suspicion edenred wants developers to work for free at prototyping ideas of those over 9000 managers.
the payment consists of a pebble, plus flight, food, and hotel. if they hired freelance developers, this would have to be payed for too.<p>am i too suspicious or is this ok?	2014-05-20 16:16:03 UTC		13
2761167	ask hn: i quit my job to start my own company. now what?	for the last 5 years i've been the lead developer at a technology company in nagoya that specializes in digital signage and custom internet solutions.<p>over the last year and a half, i came to realize that i was not happy at my current job, and that i was depressed with the way that much of japan handles developments in technology, specifically their reluctance to embrace such basic concepts as data-driven development and customer pattern analysis. (or even such simple things as being searchable on google!)<p>for japan to succeed in a global (and even domestic) market, that has to change.
i want to help bring about that change, and i've come to realize that i can't do that at my current job.<p>so because of a dream to change japan (and the constant prodings of patio11) come august, i will no longer be employed at my current company, and frankly that scares the bejesus out of me.<p>i have contacts, and i can probably make it as a freelancer, but that's not the reason i quit (although being freed of salaryman hours is a nice benefit).<p>i have a dream, but don't know how to bring it about.
it may be a stupid thing to post on a public forum, but it is what i believe in.<p>are there any of you on hackernews who have been in the same position?

325330	ask hn: demotivated founder with lost passion seeking advice	<i></i><i>posting this for a friend who is ceo of a startup, but wishes to remain anonymous</i><i></i><p>the past few weeks, i've been demotivated.  our product is done and we're ready to launch, but there's a bigger problem, i'm just not passionate anymore.  the current cons:<p>a) my cofounder doesn't have it.  he's not tech savy at all, doesn't contribute the way he should, and has turned everything into a two person bureaucracy.  just not a motivating person to work with.  he also hasn't made any real sacrifices.  i've left school, moved across the country, and a lot more for our startup.<p>b)  it's been close to two years of work, and not a whole lot of momentum.  we've bootstrapped the entire time, with a small amount from a customer.  bad part is, we don't have any money left for new development.  i've handled a good portion of the tech issues, except for the core programming of the app:  interface design, database design, sys admin/config, some bug fixing,etc. think of it more as a cto role, than a lead dev role. at the end of the day it's still 2 of us, that's a troubling sign.  i'm a pretty motivating person, and the fact no one else has really shown interest in helping out or getting involved is scary.  <p>c)  i'm not overly familiar with how to run an enterprise/business software company.  i've done consumer tech, this isn't my first venture, and i know enough (and yet have a shitload to learn).  consumer web companies seem much more straight forward to me. business web apps are a different beast to launch.  <p>d) this isn't a question of lack of traction, is it a good company, good product, etc. maybe this is the scary part: the product is awesome, the market were going after is a good one, and there's a lot of opportunity. the problem lies more with the co-founder and the overall energy/excitement of the company.<p>so my question is:<p>a) do i bail out and start something else/ join something else that is in its really early stages?<p>b) is there a way to get motivated again/fix these problems? <p>many thanks in advance.	2008-10-06 21:33:18 UTC		35

9360061	how many hours do you work a day (developers)?	after 3 in-place jobs, i&#x27;ve been working at home for three months now. one thing i have noticed is that i can deliver a comparable (&quot;samey&quot;) amount of progress in less hours of pure work.<p>at my office-located jobs, i waited to complete 7-8 hours of work (excluding chit-chat, etc) in order to feel satisfied. now i can do with 4:30 on average. for me being interruption-free is a huge boost.<p>personally i do believe in measuring effort in work-hours. assuming you feel optimal (which i constantly make sure of), the more time you spend the more you get done. also, 90% of webdev does not require that much creative hard-thinking imo.<p>my question simply is - do you find 4:30 of work a day acceptable (for you)? and marketable (for employers to accept it)?<p>anyway, feel free to post how many hours you work, and what you think about it.	2015-04-11 18:03:34 UTC		55

1832191	is hn only about saying nice things about everything?	my personal problem with hn, is that every time i dare to write a comment that is not positive about something, i get downvoted and in most cases the downvoter doesn't care much about explaining it, even when my comment spawned an interesting discussion.<p>it's very annoying that 100+ karma users could act as really good trolls, they could just go around and downvote everybody without ever loosing karma, but costing the commenter karma.<p>don't get me wrong i really enjoy the hn community, there are a lot of bright people here and very good content and discussions, it's just that the system discourages you to have your own opinion on anything, because if you write something that a 100+ user doesn't like he can simply downvote you irresponsibly.<p>tl, dr: i don't know maybe it's me, maybe i have too radical opinions on stuff. but overall i feel that the downvoters should loose some karma too, and maybe force the downvoter to write a reason for it, to make sure that they downvote responsibly.<p>ps: i am not saying neither that i'm always right nor that i never deserved the downvote.	2010-10-25 23:55:19 UTC		69
2380309	show hn: homebrewvault.com	hi guys, long time lurker, first time (non-comment) submission.<p>i've been working on homebrewvault.com  (mostly nights) for what seems like forever.  i'm just about finished with the core product and am almost ready to do some promotion.  i've always followed the "show hn" submissions because they seem to produce really valuable feedback. so before i take the plunge, i'd love to hear what you guys think.  i'm also going with the "if you aren't embarrassed by your first release, you aren't releasing early enough" philosophy i first learned of here.<p>for a little more background:
as a homebrewer of about 5 years, i was frustrated by the lack of online features in home brewing software.  there is really only one software solution from a single incumbent that seems to have a virtual monopoly.  it's windows only client software and very complex.  my aim was to create a site that would be easy to use and allow brewers to create and store recipes online, so they could more easily share them and access them from anywhere.  there are an estimated 3 million home brewers out there, so this seems like a somewhat niche market that is still big enough to benefit from some disruption and new ideas.<p>feedback appreciated!

9514903	ask hn: has anyone else found angular to be destroying their productivity?	i recently joined a new company that uses angular. i&#x27;m not really <i>directly</i> bashing angular here, because i like the ideas behind it and think it&#x27;s a neat framework that can potentially be used well.<p>however, what i&#x27;ve found is that every single little thing is being blown up by 10x loc in order to &quot;fit the angular philosophy&quot;....things i could accomplish in 150-300 lines of plain js become 1600 lines of angular code, written before i got here, which i have to spend hours debugging.<p>i find 90% of my development time is spent figuring out the angular flow of code when the problem should be so simple.<p>has anyone had similar experiences?	2015-05-09 00:30:34 UTC		18

"the future is already here; it's just not evenly distributed yet." -- william gibson<p>i find this quote to be a more reliable guide to the future than most predictions.<p>in 2000, google was already two years old. wireless was still pretty new, but every geek gathering just <i>had</i> to have it. little digital cameras that you could attach to a phone were interesting curiosities. phones that did email and web browsing existed but were super expensive and clunky.<p>in the other thread with predictions for the decade, almost all of them boil down to whatever's hot in 2009, only more so.<p>i'd like to ask the hn community to instead think of the really niche, expensive, geeky, "the mainstream will never get this" aspects of their lives <i>right now</i>. stuff they find really useful, or just cool. and then consider if there's any upper bound to much they could scale up, or how easy these technologies could be made for others.<p>now <i>those</i> would be predictions....	2010-01-01 21:47:03 UTC		10

145699	ask yc: for the love, or the money?	in my spare time, i've been working on a product that has a fair amount of interest around it. i have no doubt that once i get the product finished, the company will be successful and profitable. i see some market opportunities that is making me want to push harder and get done sooner, but with a day job paying my bills, i can only move so fast.<p>thus, i think to myself, how about getting an investor or a loan? loans are pretty much out of the option, as far as i can tell, because i don't have enough assets personally (and if i did, i wouldn't need one!). and when looking at investors, it appears that most of them look for some "big money" event.<p>but that's the conflict of interest, i suppose. i have no problems making money, but i'm not doing this startup because i want to make a ton of money going public or being acquired. i'm doing the startup because it's something i love, and something i want to be able to use myself.<p>inevitably, i resign myself to the double life of my day job and my passion. so the question to everyone here is: what's a guy like me to do? are there options that would allow me to dedicate my entire life to this that i haven't considered and won't make me feel like i'm selling out?	2008-03-25 14:32:36 UTC		5

9634149	ask hn: why is it so hard to manage tabs long term in my browser?	i want to be able to tag tabs and windows, and be able to not only hide tags, but be able to restore them when i unhide them.<p>i want to be able to do this in a cloud-synced way, and enforce tags in windows (such as if a window is tagged #foo, only #foo tags can be in it), and be able to automatically update things sanely, such as if i open a #foo tag, its automatically added to the #foo list, so if i have a #foo window open elesewhere the tab is also opened there.<p>i want my browser to be less annoying and more useful to deal with tasks, however, the closest thing i have is &quot;bookmark all tabs into a folder&quot; and &quot;open bookmark folder in new window&quot; which is very cumbersome, and that is just an unworkable model.	2015-05-31 13:45:35 UTC		3

2568563	autoresponder through amazonses, sendgrid and others - feedback requested	i'm looking for feedback on a product that i'm thinking of building.<p>the product is an online service that would let companies create autoresponders.  in our app users would add their setup their autoresponders after providing api information for their email provider - we're planning to integrate with amazon ses, postmark and sendgrid to start.<p><pre><code>  for example, a user might setup an autoresponder for registering on their website.  with an initial email, then another 5 days later, 10 days later and 14 days later.  they would upload all the html files for these emails to our application.  we would schedule them, and when the time came we'd send them out for them.  we would aggregate all the stats for the emails for the end user as well.
 </code></pre>
most email companies allow users to setup autoresponders, but charge based on the size of the list. the difference in this app would be that we'd work with the existing operational email providers, and wouldn't send anything out ourselves, so we wouldn't charge based on the size of a list - we'd only charge based on the number of emails that were sent out per month.<p>thanks,<p>mike	2011-05-20 17:19:15 UTC		1

2458875	ask hn: can node.js replace mozilla rhino?	i was reading through john resig's blogs about testing out different data structures for storing and searching an english dictionary using javascript. it struck me that he uses node.js instead of mozilla rhino to test and analyze these structures and algorithms, despite the fact that he works for mozilla. now i know that mozilla and john are enlightened enough not to let project sponsorship or ownership get in the way of using the best tool, but i'm curious? how does node compare to rhino?<p>is rhino dying? steve yegge never released rhino on rails. now, also, i know that node is vastly different, as a platform from rhino because, in node, you write entire web applications using chains of callbacks, and rhino is just a js interpreter written in java. but, what are the applications where node can replace rhino, either because third party libraries aren't necessary or because the libraries are implemented for node?<p>i'd like to hear from hn users who've started using node where they were using rhino before and also from users who have js code which will only run on rhino.<p>i'll start off with a svg/pdf print server i have written in rhino which uses apache fop and velocity. i can't imagine node has libraries to let me do the same thing.	2011-04-18 12:49:48 UTC		9

801661	ask hn: as an "it professional" do you/should you get to claim overtime?	i'm curious to learn about how other jurisdictions from my own (the province of ontario, in canada) stack up in regards to it professionals' ability to claim overtime. is it common or uncommon where you work/live? moreover, do you think that it professionals should qualify for overtime?<p>for a little background, in ontario, an "it professional" is defined as "professionals who use specialized knowledge and professional judgement to work with information systems based on computers and related technologies." (http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/guide/guide_22.html#information)<p>this definition is so broad that it covers everything from tech support staff to software engineers. according to the ontario employment standards act, an it professional is exempt from sections vii and viii of the act, which cover hours of work, daily rest periods, weekly/bi-weekly rest periods, eating periods, and overtime. this means that there are no regulations for it professionals in these areas. naturally, it seems you'd be hard-pressed to find an itp that can claim overtime in ontario, and, i suppose, technically, employers here do not even have to provide you with time to eat or sleep.	2009-09-03 02:49:14 UTC		5

  2. what features are most important to you?
  3. would you pay?  if so, how much?
  4. what services or features are we missing?

2734392	ask hn: what do you think of these claims on vc deals?	i read this on an anti-vc website and took it with a grain of salt. what do you think?<p>"here's a bonus 11th reason why venture capital is bad. it is by far the most expensive money an entrepreneur can ever tap into. let's do the math to see why this is. suppose you and a venture capitalist agree to a "pre-money" valuation of $1 million for your start-up, and the venture capitalist then invests $1 million for 50% of the equity. after the investment, the company is said to have a "post-money" valuation of $2 million. being 50/50 partners sounds acceptable, right?<p>three years later the company is sold to a fortune 500 corporation for $5 million. do you and the venture capitalist each get $2.5 million from the proceeds? not on your nellie! the venture capitalist will have a so-called "liquidation preference" built into the original investment agreement which allows him to first take out 2 to 5 (or more) times his principal before anyone else sees a penny. so, let's say that in this example he takes out $3 million (i.e., a "3x liquidation preference"), plus any accrued dividends on his preferred stock. after exercising the liquidation preference and cashing in his dividends only $1 million is left. you, the founder, and your team, will then split this remaining money on a 50/50 basis with the venture capitalist.<p>this is a simplified example of what happens. in real life the founder and her team would probably receive far less than even the $500,000 due to all the fine print clauses."<p>rest is here: http://www.antiventurecapital.com/venturecapital.html	2011-07-06 15:44:25 UTC		1

3317985	an obscure competitor is giving away my product	i'm working on a product for the company at which i'm a cofounder.  so is some other guy.  the products will be functionally identical once both are deployed and out of beta.  in comparison:<p>me: 6 months with php and mysql
him: professional developer<p>us: 2500 twitter followers, 20k unique page views per month
him: 9 twitter followers, page views unknown<p>us: marketing a basic subscription at $9/mo, up to $99/mo for high-volume biz customers
him: free.<p>we currently have paying users from our content-paywall model, and we have been around for over 2 years.  he's toiling in obscurity now, but he's one tweet away from becoming a serious competitor. i've reached out to him to see if he's interested in working together, but the response has been unenthusiastic.  the only saving grace is that we still have a pretty massive user base to whom we can market this product.  he is starting from 0, effectively.<p>this is the first time in our history that anyone has presented competition.
as the only programmer on staff, i am worried.  my programming skills pale in comparison to his.  although i'm learning at a breakneck pace, it is discouraging to see him progressing much faster.  as hard as i am working, i get a pit in my stomach thinking about what will happen if he both beats us to market (likely) and gets media attention (possible).  i have to keep track of his progress, but each time i check in i get dejected and lose my motivation to work.  i am sure most of this comes from insecurity in my own skill set since i'm still very new to programming.<p>i know this feeling is not new territory.  what do you do to push through it?	2011-12-06 05:01:08 UTC		7

2347896	ask hn: can it become a startup or be sold?	i work for a digital agency that build sites and online campaigns. the main product there is a cms, it is done in flex and php. this app works but has some problems and they really want to move forward and leave flex behind. 
thinking about that and how it is done actually, i build a new app using standard web technologies (html, css, javascript) at home and free hours. the content and layout of the pages is edited in place, i really like the results and have some cool ideas for it. 
now i'v been thinking what should i do, i thought about 1) try to sell then this app; 2) make a startup from it; 3) give it to then for some kind of better promotion because they offered one last friday if i become maintainer of the current app. 
so what is the right or best thing to do? some advices?	2011-03-21 00:41:28 UTC		1

2556015	ask hn: is there a "show us your work" for job hunting managers?	i'm a developer who followed the management track and found myself really enjoying it.  after a few years of managing a decent sized it department, i'm interested in putting out some feelers and seeing what else the market has available. no gripes with my current employer; i'm primarily looking for something that's more challenging. (a bump in compensation certainly wouldn't hurt either).<p>this is the first time that i'm job hunting as a manager and i'm not sure what's expected of me. one of the things we've always emphasized during the hiring process for developers is the same thing i see a lot here on hn: "we only care about one thing: what have you built and shipped? no resumes needed here, we just want to see what you can do." (from http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2542432)<p>is there an equivalent for managers? i've really cleaned up my resume and made sure to highlight the things that i've achieved but it feels weird to be job hunting without a portfolio of things to show. are my personal programming projects still relevant since i'll primarily be looking for a tech management position?<p>any advice is appreciated.	2011-05-17 11:22:44 UTC		32

2976216	ask hn: block based cloud storage application. promising - or not?	i've built a fairly complete prototype of a block-level virtual disk backed by commodity cloud storage.  
it provides robust, efficient, zero-maintenance offsite storage ie. it delivers data security.<p>it works by implementing a massive virtual disk volume (up to 256 terabytes) formatted with the platform filesystem-of-choice - ntfs/windows only at this stage.<p>block updates are encrypted and compressed on the fly then marshalled and snapshotted before exporting to amazon s3 (but could be any cloud storage provider).<p>from the users perspective, they've just added a massive internal hard disk accessible via the standard fileystem access api's and tools.  
one way of thinking about it is as a cloud-backed-truecrypt but with full-volume versioning, thin provisioning and compression added.<p>its primary benefits are:<p>* data security (offsite vs local, cloud storage robustness vs hard disk robustness)<p>* the ability to map and manage storage capacity many orders of magnitude larger than the local storage capacity of the installation platform ie. 100's of terabytes of storage available on a tablet.<p>* it offers a transparent cloud storage gateway - users can leverage of cloud storage via the familiar storage disk model<p>as opposed to the folder/file representation implemented by the the webdav/fuse offerings, the block-based model retains all of the native filesystem attributes associated with the users files are retained (permissions, encryption, compression) as well as other filesystem metadata (journalling, quotas etc).<p>bandwidth and storage overheads are surprisingly low: an empty 256 terabyte ntfs volume still requires a 600mb filesystem metadata overhead, yet that formatted volume can be represented using just 150kb of bandwidth/cloud storage initially while subsequent snapshots to the same volume only incur ~40kb each.<p>so it can readily and efficently perform regular fine-grained snapshots on user's data, consuming bandwidth and storage in the same ballpark as file-based technologies.<p>so that's what it does - here's where i am at the moment:<p>when i first started on it (quite some time back), my initial thoughts were to release it as a pro-sumer product or as a freemium service.<p>what i have come to realise is that even though tools like dropbox and zumodrive are not focused primarily on data security (ie. they deliver sharing and collaboration), the level of mindshare these services enjoy makes marketing any sort of cloud storage offering an uphill task, especially for a startup.<p>so i have had cause to stop and re-evaluate whether i should push on or drop it.<p>consequently, i'm after feedback:<p>is this approach/technology/product promising or a dog?<p>are the benefits of full-fidelity data compelling enough to differentiate it?<p>is it just a solution looking for a problem?	2011-09-09 00:06:39 UTC		6

8413796	is facebook promoting a monopoly in the dating space?	on september 29th 2014 facebook disabled our ads for a dating mobile app specific to brazil. upon further investigation we discovered that facebook closed their doors to all dating apps execpt those they have made a commercial agreement with. they claim that these ads have to be more &quot;serious&quot; (ours are!) showing less flesh and be more geared towards real couples (ours is!) and that they are not open to new partnerships. interestingly they allow ads from a larger dating service (starts with z) to run, even though their focus is on &quot;meet female singles now&quot;- note the emphasis on the plural; it&#x27;s about scoring. yet facebook is happy to show their ads.<p>it is sad to see facebook closing the doors on the little guys like us and promote the big players, hindering competition and innovation from the new, little guys.<p>here&#x27;s their answer:<p>&quot;to make sure everyone has a positive experience on facebook, ads for dating sites and apps are only allowed from approved advertisers through a direct sales partnership. this means that you must have prior authorization from facebook to buy dating ads on facebook. unfortunately, we aren&#x27;t accepting new partners at this time.&quot;<p>i support their motivation, but closing the doors on services that are compliant just because you already closed a deal with a big player just does not seem correct to me.	2014-10-05 23:45:46 UTC		5

8290675	comprehensive list of api's per market	i was wondering if there is a list of all the popular api&#x27;s, be it free or paid, per market.<p>for example i&#x27;m currently working on a startup in the travel industry and would need an api to sync hotel names&#x2f;addresses and another one to sync flights.<p>do you know about a collection of api&#x27;s somewhere?	2014-09-09 15:38:51 UTC		8
8422741	ask hn: how much equity is it “fair” to retain when leaving my startup?	i co-founded a startup a couple of years ago, which is doing moderately well; non-zero revenues (still not profitable), a few employees and around 100k users. we almost raised a round a month ago, but the deal fell through. i have taken no salary whatsoever, and burnt all my savings. in short, it has taken its toll.<p>i can no longer afford to keep doing this (married +2), so i want to call it quits. my co-founder wants to keep going, and believes he can still raise a good seed round and build some momentum for the company to succeed. i don&#x27;t disagree, but i&#x27;m done. now, i own about 45% of the shares, as does he, and the rest is split between employees, conv. notes and advisers.<p>my co-founder wants me to return most of my shares to the company, keeping between a quarter to a third of what i own, which he believes is fair. otherwise, he says, he will not be able to raise any capital as that much equity being outside the company will scare off investors. i was the technical cf and built everything, and he managed the business side. 2.5 years of my life + all my savings is worth more than 15% of the company, and i was thinking a more reasonable settlement to be between 1&#x2f;2 to 2&#x2f;3 of my shares. the founders agreement entitles me to about 65% of my shares, but i am willing to give some of it up for the company to succeed.<p>i would obviously like the company to succeed, and i know 15% of something is more than 30% of nothing, but i smell bs when told 1&#x2f;4 to 1&#x2f;3 of my shares is fair and is the _only_ way to give this company a fighting chance.<p>so i wanted to ask - is this something known? that this many shares being outside the company will scare off vcs, angels, etc? can he not write it off as me having been paid with only equity, and that&#x27;s the cap status? i&#x27;ve little experience in the business&#x2f;ethics&#x2f;common practices sides of the startup world, so i&#x27;m wondering if i&#x27;m being too greedy or is he just trying to squeeze me out of what&#x27;s mine?	2014-10-07 17:54:56 UTC		1

148508	glass bead network launches (finally)	http://glassbead.net/<p>this is a social game played (for free) in a flash client. it's been 5+ years of nights-and-weekends bootstrapping (we did receive a few thousand dollars from one of our dads a couple of years ago, but that's all the funding we've got).<p>we (three founders) are mid-thirty-somethings with families. we feel pretty confident in the game itself--people who play it enjoy it and come back to play again.<p>what we're trying to figure out now is three-fold: a) how to get the "critical mass" of users we need so that something is always going on so when new users come to visit, there's someone for them to play, or at least a few games they can watch (and what is that number?). we've pretty much milked our family and friend connections at this point.<p>b) we'd love to have money so we could do it full time, market it, etc. but because we're so far along already (i.e., it's working) we're not sure whom to turn to (vcs, for example, aren't really interested because we don't need very much money). do we just keep bootstrapping, or are there groups that fund people like us?<p>c) any feedback (we're looking for feedback mostly from anyone who's actually played it, but we'll consider anything really)?<p>we hope to be able to take subscriptions soon ("premium service" which would give you some minor advantages in the game, or at least a few more options, cash tournaments, blog, etc.) and we're considering having "sponsored" beads (beads are our playing pieces, which represent everything in the known universe--from oreo cookies to apples to darth vader) as the primary revenue source someday.<p>we're holding a tournament tomorrow (saturday, march 29) at 6p mdt if anyone wants to just come and watch (or play, of course).	2008-03-28 13:33:51 UTC		8

423707	basicthinking.de ("german techcrunch") for sale	since it is causing quite a stir in the german blogoscene, i thought some people on hn might care: robert basic who writes http://www.basicthinking.de/blog/ which is one of the most popular german blogs plans to sell off said blog. it could be described as a kind of techcrunch as it often covers startups and new tech developments, albeit from a personal perspective. plus it is mostly a one man show, which makes selling it a bit weird. most expect that somebody could buy it to exploit the page rank. estimates range from 10000€ to &#62; 100000€ for sales price.<p>revenue from ads last year was about 37000€, apparently.<p>also noteworthy maybe that the blog even ranks in the top 100 of most up to date blogs as determined by the cascades project: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jure/blogs/blogs-uc-pa.html<p>update: according to his blog, it is probably the most popular german blog:<p>- technorati: authority 1.331, 8.520 blog reactions<p>- deutsche blogcharts: no.1.<p>- rivva leitmedien-ranking: no. 3.

234615	ask yc/hn: database resources and help	hey all, i am recently getting in to web development on my own and am struggling to find good resources on the organization of databases.  i am currently in college right now but cannot take the database class for another two semesters because the required prerequisites.<p>the issue that troubles me is appropriately organizing tables and efficiently organizing the information.  i am familiar with normalization and some of the basic concepts involved with such but i feel as though i am missing some possible rules of thumb or methods that individuals go about when designing the databases.<p>for example, take a site like hn or digg, what would be the appropriate way to organize user accounts, profiles, each submitted site, the comments for each site, etc.  logically, i would think that if a user made a comment, it would be appropriate to insert that comment into both the table for the user as well as the table for the site be commented on, but that may be an extremely naive approach to handling such a task. i understand that to most here this seems as though it is most likely an obvious question but if i had definitive knowledge to make an educated decision, i would do so.<p>ideally i would love some quality online resources or a simple explanation over the way you hackers go about the design phase.  good books would be appreciated but i am tight on cash so nothing too pricey.<p>thanks for any responses you guys give.  i understand this is quite a noob question and there might be a more appropriate forum out there for such a query, but i really value the analysis from most of this community. cheers!	2008-07-02 22:05:52 UTC		3

3251570	taking the plunge .. having waited too long	not sure if i'm alone in this but i've been writing down app ideas for years, and cursing every time they have eventually come to life by someone that took the risk.<p>back in '08 me and my co-founder (cto) had an idea that we've never be able to shake, he was a successful research fellow travelling the world speaking at conferences with tim berners-lee on the semantic web (earning good money!) and neither of us took the plunge, which we always regretted.<p>during this time we worked through the night (with full time jobs) hacking together different apps but never really completing anything. only to see in years gone by these apps created by people who did take the risk and build great companies. wonder if this sounds familiar to anyone else?<p>so in june we met our now fellow co-founder (3 of us) and decided to take the plunge, left our jobs and began developing. given all the risk and (often late night) concerns it's been the happiest period of my life for years! spending every day working on something we believe in and watching it come to life is a wonderful feeling.<p>we are very close to releasing our alpha version, having had some great feedback from the handful of users we've tried it on so far. as it stands we are staying pretty stealthy on the project but we'd love some feedback from hn once we've launched, if your interested please sign up here: http://plan.nr<p>i'd be happy to answer any q's in the comments, or catch me on rich@plan.nr	2011-11-18 13:00:37 UTC		7

4071493	initial traction	i created qchirp.com, a new job board for tech professionals. not very original, but i think design, fair price, and simple search can help modify a cluttered industry - i'm an it recruiter btw.<p>i have a few initial recruiters who have posted. however i feel that a job board must present several hundred jobs before gaining exponential traction - the traditional "chicken and egg problem".<p>there's several postings explaining how to buy/attract initial users. however i'd be hugely appreciative if someone has advice in regards to attracting recruiters. how does a job board reach critical max?<p>advertising on google adwords? stumbleupon?
 strategic partnerships?
 blogging?<p>also if you want to visit qchirp.com and rip it to shreds on quality, i'd love it. all criticism is helpful :)<p>thx!!	2012-06-05 23:13:42 UTC		1

406330	ask hn: opening a company	so i've got a ridiculously simple idea which i think is pretty good. that is, it is something i'd pay to use and people i've asked would pay to use too. it's a subscription-based service where i will be able to charge $10 to $25 monthly per user.<p>i have taken the time to write the code for it and it seems to work very nicely. i could only work on it on weekends since i have a day job which i like very much. but quite surprisingly, despite having worked on it for only 10 hours so far, i think it's already good enough to try it with a group of friends.<p>also, despite having what i think is a strong business model, i'm not willing to take any investment money whatsover, so if i do manage to launch it, i'll pay for hosting and everything myself. now the question: i'm a brazilian citizen living in brazil, and one of the things i think i'll need is to actually be able to found a company in the us or uk, so i can have a business bank account there, so i can have the website take international credit cards via authorize.net or something.<p>does anyone have experience with that? requirements? fees? how hard could that be? my guess is that i'll need to hire some professional assistance, i just have no idea where to look.	2008-12-22 13:07:39 UTC		4

9224398	handling multi-currency subscriptions with free trials (using stripe)	seeing as &quot;everyone&quot; uses stripe, we can&#x27;t be the only one experiencing this problem.<p>when you use stripe to handle trials, what you actually do is start them on a subscription with an invoice value = 0 with whatever currency you have as your default.<p>now of course you don&#x27;t want your signups to choose what currency they &#x2f;might&#x2f; pay in 30 days later, however once you have assigned an invoice in one currency to a user it is not possible to change the currency.<p>most of our users are currently in the uk, so if an eu person signs up they are started on our uk trial. however when they select to pay in eur they get an error as we can&#x27;t switch their currency.<p>how do other saas companies who use stripe for multi-currency subscriptions with free trial periods handle this? seems only option is not to use stripe to handle the trial part of a subscription and only create their stripe account once they want to subscribe.	2015-03-18 09:39:29 UTC		1

5499001	i worked on an idea for 4 months, found out it already exists	...and is probably being done better than i can do it. my question to hn is whether or not it's worth continuing, and what are your similar experiences (and what did you do).<p>for context, if i were to finish building out my prototype (at least another 4 months of work) it would essentially be one feature of an existing language learning application. maybe i could do that one feature better and differentiate on that, maybe not.<p>i'm just really flabbergasted that this happened, and i'm not sure how to proceed. i mean i learned a fair deal of engineering skills from my work thus far, but i'm unsure how to turn this into a business that i can approach investors with.<p>"oh, so what you're building already exists as a part of this other application..."<p>"but i'm gonna make it much better, i swear!"<p>like if i were to continue with this project, i'm not sure how i could convince anyone to invest in it. given the circumstances, would nothing short of a full prototype (mobile app) that i could put in peoples' hands be sufficient to convince them of the potential?<p>thanks for any advice, i've never run into this situation before.	2013-04-05 15:32:40 UTC		5

5779313	ask hn: remote encrypted backup recommendation?	hey everyone,<p>i've been researching my backup requirements lately, and my requirements are:<p>* encrypted, trusted (this implies open source) backups.<p>* able to backup to a remote server. google drive is a plus.<p>* not terribly bandwidth intensive.<p>* not terribly expensive, as i'm backing up non-critical photos which are already on raid and local backups anyway.<p>i'm currently using spideroak, but i don't like the fact that it's closed source. i experimented with duplicity, but it turns out that it requires me to reupload my entire 50 gb collection every month or so, as it's good sense to have full backups every so often.<p>the problem is that, even though i require encryption, it shouldn't roll all files into a huge ball of mud, as that will need reuploading every once in a while, it's not easy to sync, etc.<p>basically, the ideal for me would be something like duplicity with per-file encryption, or rdiff-backup with encryption. is there something that would fit the bill, or would i have to build it myself?	2013-05-28 11:28:50 UTC		4
