1962363	ask hn: advice on software contracting 	i'm in talks with another company that would like to use me as a contractor to build mobile applications for "their brand".  we had tentatively agreed to a ballpark _fixed_ price--we haven't signed anything yet.  however, there are 3 issues that are emerging:<p>* their concept of what features they "want" in their apps is extremely vague. i don't think they're being deceitful (planning to dump additional features on me at the last minute). rather, i think they genuinely don't have a vision for what they want and they would simply prefer that i "take care" of almost everything (more on this below).<p>* despite the lack of a _specific_ vision for what they want, there has already been some "feature-creep" and i'm concerned that the addition of features will blossom if we consummate the deal. the feature-creep is compounded by the fact that the feature requests are not fleshed-out, so when i see a new feature request i'm left wondering "how much will it take to implement feature x?"  when i ask them for additional detail, it's clear that they don't have a clear vision of what they want.<p>* it also seems that they would prefer it if i just ran/maintained the applications on my own (they don't want to be bothered with the technical headaches).  however, these applications require at least 1 remote server (the applications will routinely query a remote database), so what initially seemed like a "build us some mobile apps" contract is turning into a "build us some apps and an infrastructure and maintain everything" contract.<p>my gut instinct is to convert this into an hourly "pay as we go" contract.  however, i don't want to completely turn the tables on them over the fixed price and i'm trying to come up with a hybrid approach. i'd like to structure something that protects <i>me</i> against feature-creep and something that protects <i>them</i> against slipping deadlines.<p>so, my questions are:<p>1) any general advice on how to proceed?<p>2) has anyone structured contracts like this: "i'll build you a piece of software with features x y z.  i expect that it will take me 6 weeks of full-time work and i will charge $a. any additional feature requests or revisions beyond those features are billed at $b.<p>thanks for any insight!	2010-12-02 15:21:09 UTC		1	1

8336292	ask hn: how would you write front end code for bookkeeping app?	a lot has been said about writing and organizing frontend code. tools like grunt.js, clojurescript, all sorts of reactive libraries and all-in-one frameworks have been invented. but every time i see something like this discussed it&#x27;s mostly about rich-ui web-services, one-page apps, stuff like netflix and such, but it is very different from what your typical back-office app. clear ui is the key for the front-end site, but crms and such are notoriously known for their insanely complicated interfaces. one-page js-apps also don&#x27;t seem like a good idea here, as things are complicated enough without that and dramatic changes in ui happen on a day-to-day basis, not once in a while like on your front page. i don&#x27;t really see how should i organize and compile clojurescript sources, when i&#x27;m using pretty much unique js-code for each page.<p>both users and developers often don&#x27;t really care about that, because business-logic is the king on the back-office side. but still, have you any articles that would talk about that or maybe you have some thoughts of your own? i&#x27;m writing stuff like that for quite some time now, but still have that feel that there could be some way to do it <i>right</i>, and i&#x27;m not even close to it.	2014-09-18 17:01:52 UTC		1	4

5200580	ask hn: explosive growth or bootstrapped? out of my depth. 	my startup, geddit, has started getting some attention from business angels, potential mentors, accelerators and the like.<p>we are building a tool that enables and analyses the feedback cycle between students and educators to improve education (link in profile). the business model is currently a pure-product play. we have a tool that addresses certain pain points among our customers, and we had intended to use a freemium model to market and distribute the product. scaling would require marketing and direct sales.<p>a potential mentor recently had the insight that the product offering did not have enough supporting leverage to really become a player, if someone made a big play to capture students and other users of education. his suggestion was that we create an education focussed rating platform - something like tripadvisor for education, gain traction and scale really quickly to create a lever for our product.<p>his sketch was traction in the next 6 months, ~$0.5m funding round by november. my instincts are that this is ludicrous, but his point seemed strong and well made - we shouldn't fall in love with our solution, we should solve the problem. i want to be able to ask this guy smart questions - here's what i have so far:<p>- how do you expect to make a return on your time and effort?<p>- what sort of traction would we require (number and % of users) to move to 1.) a funding round that big and 2.) the feedback product rollout?<p>- what specific experience or connections do you have that would help us believe you can do this?<p>what else should i be asking? who else should we be talking to? what can we read? all input appreciated.	2013-02-11 13:13:08 UTC		1	0

8413990	selling a site on flippa	i own a website (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.bongotones.com) that i started in 2009. at it&#x27;s peak we were doing 250k a year from advertisement. due to some unfortunate issues, bad business decisions (eg. bad money spent on seo, design work, etc), business partners being spread across different cities and just priorities we let go of the site. it still has great potential with some tlc. in our prime we were number 3 on google for &quot;free ringtones&quot; and over the past 5 years have had over 52million page views and 6million unique views.	4
the problem with selling on flippa is that lately due to us not having time to keep the site up and only making money from adsense the revenue has dropped dramatically but we do have a database of over 180k registered users and 120k ringtones. i think that&#x27;s where the value of the website is now, a pr3 website with over 6million pages indexed on google and the database.	2
i&#x27;m posting the link here to see if anyone would be interested or get some guidance from people on how to go about selling this.<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;flippa.com&#x2f;3277671-pr-3-187000-registered-users-122000-ringtones-6-3m-indexed-pages<p>thanks!	2014-10-06 01:30:30 UTC		2	0

been working on web development for about 5months now .. 3 of which were just html&#x2f;css&#x2f;js	2
then we had a project a private project built using node.js and mongo	1
i learnt a lot .. first release was a very good job everyone was pleased including me ..	0
but then we wanted to add new features .. and i have a deadline of a month .. which basically ends today and i do not like the way i wrote the code	1
and i am not ashamed to say that i needed some sort of management&#x2f;help because i am still learning .. but i did not have that the whole past month .. and i feel that i fucked everything up	2
it works .. but the code is sloppy and the logic is not good enough .. too many bugs which has been solved using brute force .. <i>just solve it</i>	3
no good design .. not good thinking about problems and how to solve them .. just solve it using whatever code .. that&#x27;s what i did	0
and i don&#x27;t like it and i feel it will be a major screw up<p>maybe there is nothing to do about it now .. too late i mean	4
i am just looking for some comfort in your stories .. maybe someone has been there before ..	0
i don&#x27;t even like web development but it pays off and i need it just like anyone needs the money	4

http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.cultofmac.com&#x2f;175422&#x2f;apple-patents-lying-to-those-who-are-spying&#x2f;<p>i roughly propose an open source application that can run when you are not using the computer, similar to the seti program.<p>it may take a dictionary that randomises all user activity to a point that it is undetectable from real activity.<p>search terms and habits may be shared randomly among users, and it would not only solve the nsa issue but also the big corporate issue too.<p>i would use a dictionary without the keywords relating to kiddy porn and terrorism.	0

1153379	ask hn: is doing a phd from oxford a better option than a research based job?	i have got an admit for distributed computing in wireless sensors at oxford university. after my m.s. and a couple of years of working in the silicon valley, i was inclined to look for a job in an innovative startup or an industry research lab. but because of being on a h1b, i could not find anything satisfactory in the time-frame i had (i had to urgently look for a job between march '09 and july '09 - and couldn't find anything at that time).	0
hence, rather than settling for a 'mundane' job, i decided to apply for a phd. now, after getting an admit at oxford, i am at a crossroad- should i go in for a three year doctoral program or hold out for that 'research focused job' that i am looking for.	1
some factors to consider are- i am currently self-employed in my home country working on a well-paying but uncertainity laden freelance consulting gigs.&#60;p&#62;my topic of interest is here:	3
http://urbansensors.com&#60;p&#62;any ideas or suggestions about the research interest or if there is something different that i should be exploring right now are welcome.	2010-02-26 16:09:54 UTC		3	0

8784336	ask hn: best way for online payments by installments?	our saas isn&#x27;t recurring subscription based. users get access by making one time payments.<p>because our prices are too high, most clients are asking if they may pay by installments. (for example http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.pigas.org&#x2f;pricing-medical-specialization&#x2f; )<p>now we have a problem, how can we build a system that we can collect money from a user even if they cancel their subscription.<p>note that it&#x27;s like buying a computer and paying for it monthly. you can&#x27;t give it back or cancel your subscription till the whole payment is done.<p>we&#x27;re using stripe and paypal payment methods on our website. is there any way to collect money from the clients even if they cancel their subscription?<p>i&#x27;m from germany and collecting money here isn&#x27;t a problem, we can just send an invoice and collect money. but most of our clients are in other countries so i think we can collect only by credit cards, but i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s possible somehow to collect money even the owner tries to bypass us.<p>i know some companies do it. for example car rent companies in germany, before renting a car they need just a credit card, they don&#x27;t accept cash or wire transfer. they do it because after giving the car back, they examine the car and if something is damaged, or even it&#x27;s dirty, they collect money from the credit card that provided at first day. but how can we do it for our online business?	2014-12-22 18:33:38 UTC		3	0

919671	who is hiring (remotely)?	there have previously been "who's hiring" type of posts. those attracted much attention and many people either found or changed their job thanks to those posts. however almost 100% of offers were for onsite work and most of them were in silicon valley.<p>there's world outside of silicon valley though. even outside of us. and it's a big world out there, with many talented people who just happen to live elsewhere.<p>i'm ruby on rails freelancer with 3.5+ year experience, living in poland. in a week or two i'm about to finish my current project and i'm looking for exciting opportunities. i believe <i>many, many</i> people are in similar position to mine so many companies and individuals could benefit from this.<p>so if there are companies (and i know there are many) who hire for remote positions, let's put it here and make good companies and talented people meet and work together.<p>as for me, i'm looking for an opportunity to work where not only coding is required. people too often think that developers should just pump out code. their creative or strategical input regarding the company is mostly disregarded, if at all taken into consideration.	0
i don't want to work <i>for</i> somebody. i want to work <i>with</i> somebody and make a difference.<p>so let's see all those opportunities for everybody who just cannot physically be where the most is happening.	2009-11-03 16:47:57 UTC		5	2

3768098	support for startups?	support for startups.<p>a friend and i were walking around the stanford last friday, and we were both doing some thinking about our lives, and where we want to go with them. after a while, the topic turned to maybe starting our own startup, the problem of course, is neither of us are software developers, nor are we particularly enamored with the idea of yet another photo sharing/social networking/whatever site we both feel all of those markets are very saturated.<p>we then looked at what both of us know well. support. both of us are top tier support folks - i have a background in field work, telecom support, and system administration, with a large side of customer/technical support as well as some sales engineer/project management stuff, he has a background in technical/customer support, with a strong side of technical documentation as well as a side of finance/business management.<p>so we got to thinking, what is missing in this market?<p>what about a company to provide customer support aimed at startups, empirically, there does seem to be a market - having your developers directly support customers is both inefficient and frustrating for everyone involved, beyond that, if your product is paid, you do really need real support, preferably being able to reach someone by phone. even if your product has no direct customer payment, if your product is complex enough, or used by enough people, you at least <i>should</i> have an email que, staffed by real people to get answers to the questions that cannot be covered by your faq.<p>both of us also have a large number of friends (read former co-workers) who could staff out such an enterprise, and i have enough telecom experience to get the basics of a contact center going. i've been looking at how to structure pricing, if for example you don’t want dedicated agents, we could just charge a per call amount to you, or for those who do want dedicated agents, a fixed monthly charge, plus a much smaller per call charge. beyond this, i have some ideas to give companies the benefits of traditional internal contact center folks, while still being able to have it managed at arms length.<p>so i suppose the question for hn are there startups looking for this service?	2012-03-28 20:10:43 UTC		5	4

8412711	ask hn: what to learn and where to focus your time and attention?	i a software engineer with 9 years  of experience, mostly in java&#x2f;python space.  recently i started learning c for fun.  i was beginning to enjoy it.  then someone claimed i need to know angularjs, so i tried that.  suddenly in an interview i was asked if i had ever read &#x27;clean code&#x27; book (which i hadn&#x27;t).  another friend said i should learn a cloud service for web  app hosting, so i delved into google app and compute engine.  my boss said android is hot and i should pick it up,  i immediately installed android studio and tried working on it.<p>now i feel stuck and in a quagmire.  i have a problem of attention deficit and this quandary is causing me lose sleep.  i am passionate about technology and don&#x27;t mind learning anything, literally anything.  but where to focus time and efforts is something i have never ever been able to figure out.  the result is that i know very little about a lot of things (very very little), but nothing substantial about almost anything.  this is driving me crazy.  any suggestions from anyone who faced this?	2014-10-05 16:54:05 UTC		8	1

i&#x27;ve owned reversegif.com for almost two years now. its an awesome app that lets you upload and reverse animated gifs. the site is by far the community favorite, and has been pulling in 400k uniques per month steadily for the last two years.<p>its serves such a niche purpose i don&#x27;t know where to take it from here. financially the site performs poorly - barely covering hosting  on a month to month basis. but i want to utilize the traffic and add more features that would bring the community value but i dont know where to go from here.<p>thoughts?	2013-10-21 22:12:45 UTC		9	2

2477877	ask hn: how would you architect around potential aws failures?	with the aws outages over the last few days, i've been wondering how you would set up a system using only aws services that would be resistant to multi-availability zone outages across multiple services within a geographical region.  assume that the system that we are setting up is an api that will have heavy read/write traffic with a significant number of users, and that the startup running it is on a typical shoestring budget that makes aws attractive.<p>what got a lot of startups in trouble was architecting systems that were fault-tolerant across availability zones within the us-east region, but when one availability zone went down, everybody's apps started flooding the other availability zones, causing more problems.  a typical setup might have been an elastic load balancer with ec2 instances in a few availability zones (with the ability to create new instances in other availability zones in response to outages), multi-az rds database servers, and s3 backups to multiple az's.<p>what i'm looking for is ideas for taking this setup and expanding it to multiple geographical regions, using only aws services.  would you have multiple stacks and use route 53 dns to route users to different regions?  how would you keep databases in sync across regions?  would you use one region as a primary and periodically back up to	2011-04-23 23:37:07 UTC		88	0

to give an obvious example of what i&#x27;m looking for- i would say, use margins to separate multiple instances of same components (among other uses). i wonder if there are books that deal with similar, but non-obvious topics.	2015-03-07 16:18:30 UTC		144	2

7572375	plain-english explanation of heartbleed for social networks	my best effort to use layman terms while still conveying how serious the issue is. feel free to copy&#x2f;paste to a social network to educate your friends, family and stalkers:<p>you should change your password on all internet services you care about immediately. not as soon as possible, right now.<p>before changing your password on a service you should make sure that they have applied the fix for the issue, if they have not wait until they do or preferably delete your account&#x2f;personal information. lastpass have provided a helpful tool that will determine if a website has the problem and will give you a recommendation about what you should do.<p>a few days ago a severe security issue was identified with one of the most fundamental systems of the internet; this issue has been present since january 1st 2012. in a nutshell, the green padlock that banks tell you to look out for on their website (https) has not only been a false guarantee since 2012; it actually exposed your information more than websites without it. the issue has been fixed, but it is the responsibility of the websites to apply that fix to their systems.<p>at this point it is a reasonable guarantee that a hacker somewhere has your passwords. you may also want to keep a close eye on your credit card if you have used it on the internet during the past two years. ordering a new one from your bank would not be overly paranoid.<p>this may include internet services other than websites, such as the email account your isp may provide for you or even skype.<p>technical information about the issue: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;heartbleed.com&#x2f;<p>lastpass ‪#‎heartbleed‬ checker: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;lastpass.com&#x2f;heartbleed&#x2f;	2014-04-11 12:06:18 UTC		1	4

3381395	website relaunch feedback	i just relaunched a website after a complete redesign and translation of almost 10 years of bad asp code.  the original site goes back to 2000 and has been updated many times over the years but this current version contains the most dramatic changes.  i'm a fully operational/profitable accommodation booking company based in europe.  i'm not looking for advice on how to make "idea" work or compete with the big players, as we already have a niche following and are pretty highly respected in the travel world, but i haven't received loads of feedback about the new design, and the feedback i have received is from people who were familiar with the old site and are commenting mainly on how much better it is now.  i'd love to know what it looks like to an unfamiliar viewer and since i highly respect the hn readership i hoped to get some honest thoughts.  thanks in advance!<p>https://www.cross-pollinate.com	2011-12-22 13:10:59 UTC		1	2

8903743	ask hn: best over-ear headphones 2015	so this question has been discussed multiple times in many different forums. i&#x27;ve read tons of (often conflicting) advice and recommendations and i&#x27;m still none the wiser. i appreciate this is a subjective topic, and so no exhaustive ranking will ever exist. that said i know many of you will relate to my use case: i work as a software engineer in a shared office space, i want to listen to music whilst i work, i want some level of screening from background noise, be it a byproduct of good audio itself, or some form of passive&#x2f;active noise canceling. until recently i had a pair of bose qc15s which were revolutionary to me when i first tried them (likely because i&#x27;d never spent more than $50 on headphones). i would be tempted to go ahead and get the updated qc25 and think nothing more of it. i have read however that whilst the noise canceling is by far the best, some amount of audio quality is compromised as a result. i&#x27;m now leaning toward something more refined, that isn&#x27;t making such compromise. my problem is cutting down the myriad of options to a list i can actually attempt to compare myself. as such i&#x27;d love to try and get some consensus on the top five options (at least in terms of popularity) for the scenario i describe.<p>thank you all in advance!	2015-01-17 07:11:18 UTC		1	1

3951582	alternatives for mobile app analytics	does anyone have good suggestions for mobile application analytics (android and ios)?  the product i am working on is a library that gets integrated into existing applications.  as such our usage of analytics must coexist with separate unrelated analytics use in the app.<p>google analytics works well and the reporting interface is fairly easy to navigate and find out the information you want.  some parts of the interface are bizarre though.  they have two problems.  on android the library only supports one tracker instance and reporting so we can't report our events at the same time as the rest of the app reports its events.  the second is that for numerical values (custom variables) the only thing they report is the average value which is spectacularly useless.  i need to see the distribution of values.  talking to their support would appear to require forking out $150,000 a year before they will take the call.<p>i've also tried mixpanel but had numerous issues with their android library and server side.  it has no builtin reports so you have to compose queries yourself, and even simple slicing and dicing data is a pain.  i've had to write code to import all our data locally and then do analysis there to get reports like the pre-existing ones in google analytics.  (i've been unable to get any issue addressed by their support.)<p>there is a conflict of interest with flurry (in particular all the stuff they do other than analytics).<p>a solution hosted by someone else is preferable rather than self hosting due to the expected ramp up in volume of traffic.  searches turn up numerous analytics providers, but they all have web sites as their primary focus using a chunk of javascript as the library.  while there isn't that much difference in the events generated from a mobile app compared to a web site, there is a need for a robust android and ios library and for additional values to be tacked onto events, plus being able to use those values in reports and analysis.  we also need to be able to partition data so that third parties can look at a subset of it that belongs to their app.	2012-05-10 02:32:23 UTC		1	2

3295852	about cryptographic key recognition in data streams	abstract: search for cryptographic keys in ram is a new and prospective technology which can be used, primarily, in the computer forensics. in order to use it, a cryptanalyst must solve, at least, two problems: to create a memory dump from target machine and to distinguish target cryptographic keys from other data. the latter leads to a new mathematical task: &#60;&#60;recognition of cryptographic keys in the (random) data stream&#62;&#62;. the complexity of this task significantly depends on target cryptoalgorithm. for some algorithms (i.e. aes or serpent) this task is trivial but for other ones it may be very hard. in this work we present effective algorithms of expanded key recognition for blowfish and twofish. as far as we know this task for these algorithms has never been considered before.	2

2026297	ask hn:  marketing experiment	i've heard a couple different people mention blogs where they pay someone in the philippines to write content.  the blogs run adsense or something similar.  these don't bring in tons of money, but they are profitable if marketed well.<p>a friend and i found this a little ridiculous.  we wanted to give it a shot.  1) it would improve our marketing skills, and 2) it would make an interesting story.  we wanted the site to be relatively worthless, content-wise, but still be able to gather a following.<p>we came up with an idea that wasn't completely worthless though.  our blog is music recommendation service, focusing on good songs to wake up to in the morning.  revenue would be through affiliate advertising for the songs and adsense.<p>we launched our blog, wakeuptomusic.com, about 2 weeks ago and we have really struggled to attract a following.  we've focused mainly on using social media to attract followers, which hasn't brought a lot of traffic so far.<p>i wanted to ask the hn community for any ideas you might have on how to market something like this.  we're looking at some interesting ideas with twitter, like a itunes giftcard raffle, crowdsourcing posts (the post will be the top tweets about the song, instead of one we right ourselves), etc.<p>what are some standard practices in marketing a blog like this?  what are some crazy left field ideas that might work?  this is above all an experiment and an exercise, where we have an uphill battle marketing a semi-useless blog.<p>thanks!	2010-12-20 23:56:18 UTC		2	3

3315108	ask hn: any finance topics you're interesting in learning about?	background: my co-founder and i are in the process of preparing to launch a business around financial modeling software that we've built.  we discussed the idea of writing a book (or a series of articles) that we could give away for free on finance topics (e.g., cash flows, accounting, budgeting, npv modeling, etc.).  this would hopefully allow us to 1) provide a generally useful document to anyone who downloads it and 2) demonstrate the capabilities of our software.  i've come up with a list of topics that i plan on writing about, but thought maybe i could get some ideas from hn readers to augment my own.<p>so, are there any topics that you are interested in reading about / learning about related to finance?<p>also (on a separate, but related note): once finished with the book/articles, is it appropriate to submit it to hn?  that is, i hope (and expect) that it will be useful to anyone even if they don't use our software, but obviously one of the primary goals would be to help sell software too.<p>thanks for your feedback!	2011-12-05 16:04:41 UTC		2	0

3777131	show hn: pigeonal.com, a read-only email app	appcoast is a small collective of entrepreneurs and engineers, working on extensions for ebay and bespoke work for mozilla by day, and working on the next big thing by night. this week we launched our first commercial ios app.<p>pigeonal is an email client for iphone. its purpose is to quickly archive (and occasionally mark for follow-up) emails which only need a casual glance, or a quick check, before you file them away (examples: receipts, notifications, reminders).<p>the app scans your inbox for (currently) 207 different services and displays the results using icons in pigeonholes (a wood texture cupboard).<p>q: why only gmail and mobileme/icloud?	3
a: we'll roll out general support for imap, but it takes a lot of testing. imap is hairy.<p>q: can i flag/star an email for follow-up?	1
a: that will be possible in the next version, flagged email is currently moved to a follow-up folder (which also works great, both in gmail and mobileme, but some people prefer flagging/starring).<p>q: are you crazy? asking money for a read-only email client?	2
a: the read-only feature is a deliberate design choice: it prevents you from being sucked into an email conversation. we ask money for the app because we think it provides value for some people.<p>q: are you storing my email credentials on your servers?	3

2779614	ask hn: best way to show off job skills (how to build my resume online?)	throwaway due to coworkers being on here.<p>i've been realizing for awhile, that my current job situation is coming to an end, and i'm trying to think of ways to pursue my next opportunity. i've heard a lot about things like github (but have no experience with it), building examples/demos of tech you know (but can't think of what to build). the other downside, is that my resume looks unspectacular on paper (php/mysql developer, no degree, two years programming/one year as a job). but every job i've been at, whether it was a web job or not, i've always exceeded expectations and gone from an entry level type job, to leading a team of people in a fairly short time. i'm a fast learner and strive hard for the company i'm at, so  i guess i'm just trying to think of better ways to show people this.<p>`<p>skill set (in case you have ideas for demos i can build):<p>php (object oriented, design patterns, pdo library)<p>--kohana (built a few apps in it, but am by no means dependent on it. frequently read through the source)<p>mysql<p>javascript (the actual language, not just frameworks)<p>--jquery<p>--dojo (as well as dijit widgets and such)<p>objective-c (limited, just started learning and building basic apps like calculators and physics games)<p>python (even more limited, just enjoy the language and learning it. no web experience with python)<p>`<p>as an example, here's some stuff i did for  weekend projects to help my wife:<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmlflmqmbgc<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz9ftslef4m	2011-07-19 04:30:52 UTC		4	2
122540	ask yc: why are you guys obsessd with reddit?	as someone new to the site, i am confused at the level of animosity and obsession with reddit. was reddit once a bastion of intellectual conversation until one day the trolls came in and ravaged the entire site? is news.yc currently going down the tubes? i think whats important is that the focus and content here will keep a certain demographic of people away from this site. am i wrong?	2008-02-24 17:12:41 UTC		4	2
3606796	ask hn: looking for a quiet windows desktop	i know this isn't a typical 'ask hn' question, but i'm looking for recommendations for a very quiet windows desktop. a friend lives in a small studio apartment and must have his pc near his bed. the fan on his current pc is too loud. the usual search sources (i.e., google) yield too many useless results, so i thought i'd see if any fellow hn'ers have recommendations. this doesn't have to be the most powerful machine in the world ... it simply needs to run typical home user apps at a reasonable speed. thanks in advance.	2012-02-18 15:49:46 UTC		4	1

2989945	3 reasons not to choose bluehost	i debated about a few hosting companies to use for a local organization. bluehost seemed like a good option and i had worked with them before via other clients. they claim that they don't source anything and that their servers are fast and they limit them to 2000 users/sites per server.<p>however, i realized a few things after signing up with bluehost and wanting to get cracking on a new site:<p>1) they have to "verify" your account before you get access to ssh. don't do it if you're pressed for time.<p>2) you can't create addon domains and place them above the web root for the main site. this kind of sucks because you really don't want some stuff living inside of another site's web accessible files.<p>3) you have to "verify" addon domains which is a pain.<p>========================================================<p>here is the conversation, special attention to the last two lines :)<p>========================================================<p>gordon: [10:04:52 pm] thank you for contacting our support live chat! my name is gordon. if you haven't already provided your primary domain name and validation such as last 4 of the password or last 4 of the credit card, please do so now. also, please be patient as i am often on several different chats at once. thank you!<p>mark: [10:04:52 pm] i need ssh enabled for mysite.com<p>gordon: [10:05:15 pm] can i get the last 4 of the password please?<p>mark: [10:05:22 pm] abcd1<p>gordon: [10:06:23 pm] ok, i see here the account is not yet verified by our verification department. you will need to contact them tomorrow. they are not here right now since it is 10:06pm our time. then once it is verified, follow these directions<p>[10:06:29 pm] in order to enable ssh on your account, log in to the cpanel, go down to the security section, and click on the ssh/shell access. click on the manage ssh access button, and you will be able to select "ssh access enabled". the username is your 8-character cpanel username. the password is your cpanel password you use to log in to the cpanel.<p>mark: [10:12:13 pm] hmm<p>[10:12:19 pm] what do they have to do to verify the account<p>gordon: [10:13:17 pm] i think they just confirm the last 4 of the credit card and phone number and who you are to protect against fraud<p>mark: [10:13:45 pm] ok<p>[10:13:48 pm] one more question<p>[10:13:54 pm] im trying to add an addon domain<p>gordon: [10:14:12 pm] ok<p>[10:14:52 pm] do you get a message when you try to add it? do you already have the domain purchased elsewhere?<p>[10:15:11 pm] or were you trying to register it with us as a new domain?<p>mark: [10:15:19 pm] well two problems<p>gordon: [10:15:27 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:15:30 pm] first it asks me to verify the domain<p>[10:15:56 pm] you may also verify ownership of the domain "myaddonsite.com" by creating a page at http://myaddonsite.com/9d351b11.html or http://www.myaddonsite.com/9d351b11.html which contains the text "42688b8a" (retry assigning once the page has been created).<p>[10:16:03 pm] i created that file<p>gordon: [10:16:05 pm] yes<p>[10:16:07 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:16:13 pm] but it wont let me verify<p>gordon: [10:16:25 pm] hmm<p>[10:16:27 pm] let me try<p>mark: [10:17:11 pm] secondly it wants me to point the addon domain to public_html/myaddonsite.com/ but i dont want it inside the ~/public_html directory - i want it inside a different folder like ~/myaddonsite.com/public_html<p>[10:18:59 pm] it sucks that i can't get ssh access tonight. i wanted to rsync files to the server<p>gordon: [10:19:38 pm] there is not a way to have it outside of the public_html folder, the public_html folder is where all website related folders go so it would have to be something like public_html/whateverfolder<p>mark: [10:19:54 pm] ok can you help me cancel my account please<p>gordon: [10:19:54 pm] i am seeing if we can force add the domain on the account for you<p>mark: [10:20:09 pm] don't worry about that i just want to cancel<p>gordon: [10:20:15 pm] ok<p>mark: [10:20:15 pm] i'm going with a different hosting company<p>gordon: [10:21:21 pm] you would have to contact billing tomorrow during the time they are here or submit a ticket to them. i do not have a way to close the account for you.<p>mark: [10:21:43 pm] great. another reason to cancel. thanks<p>gordon: [10:22:58 pm] you are welcome. let us know if there is anything else	2011-09-13 04:31:19 UTC		8	0

2199948	ask hn: someone has just released a very similar app, but has never seen ours?	me and a friend have been working on a web app idea for a few months now. we live in nj. we have been keeping written and online notes on the ideas and plan. recently, someone with far more experience and funding has released an uncannily similar application, but they are based in california and have never seen us or seen our idea (because it hasn't been developed yet.<p>this puts us in a very bad position to release our own idea because we are about 6 months behind and our funding is far lower. what should we do other than giving up and finding a new idea<p>edit: the reason we have been working on the idea for a few months is because we were analyzing every aspect of the business to see what we can do better. we do have a few key things we can do better.	4
the reason we haven't started building yet is because we did not know how to code. we started going to hacker news and learning to code. we simply don't have the knowledge or the money to start yet. in 6 months we will.	2011-02-10 00:04:50 UTC		11	2

421885	ask yc: is an ipo alternative needed?	i've seen this idea going around for the past six months and i was curious about the feasibility/need for it. currently there are barriers for companies to reach ipo (sarbox, etc.) which in turn makes it much more difficult for a clean exit for early-stage investors.<p>so what has been suggested is to create a secondary market (see here: http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2008/08/a-secondary-mar.html) to help fill the widening gap between startup and ipo. this would in turn create some liquidity that would lead to less risk for founders and early investors.<p>clearly there are some legal risks in actually creating a market. the only people that could participate would be accredited investors, and there would be some muddling with the sec and possibly the ctfc.<p>i'm asking yc because the discussion doesn't seem to hit this demographic. what do you think?	2009-01-06 13:22:20 UTC		14	4

379111	ask hn: boston or silicon valley?	so i'm graduating in may and have a couple of great offers from places in both boston and the valley.  i've interned in sv twice and love it.  this is both a pro and a con in that i know the place well, but at the same time i'd love to try some place different and diversify a little.  i intend to start a business at some point in the future, and as such imagine i'll eventually move to sv.  here's my pro-con list:<p><pre><code>  sv pros:	0
- gorgeous weather	4
- amazing networking opportunities	0
	2
boston pros:	4
- closer to home (i'm from ny)	3
- cheaper	0
- more diverse (less disjoint with reality)	4
</code></pre>	2
before i start a flame war over my last boston pro: while i love the valley, i sometimes feel like it's disjoint with reality in terms of how people act towards technology.  it's a nerd's haven and often awesome, but mildly unnerving at times and lacks some diversity.<p>anyway, i'd appreciate some advice as to where to go given equal offers (factoring in cost of living to a reasonable extent).  additionally i'd like some clarification on a few things to help make a more informed decision:<p>- is boston significantly cheaper than sv (i'd probably be in the mountain view area)?  it's hard to find comparable areas for cost of apartments and such.<p>- what's the startup scene like in boston?  i hear it's a great place for a software startup, but how does it compare to the valley in terms of opportunities and networking?<p>- any advice on which of two hypothetical is better: big fish little pond or little fish big pond?  alternatively, would you rather be at an important team in a lesser-known company, or a less-important team in a well-known company?<p>- any other factors i should be taking into account?  i'm looking closely at what i'd be doing, what my potential employers' non-competes look like, and how open the companies are.  one company is a private open-source company, and the other is a company of about the same size owned by a public company.<p>this is a really tough decision, and any advice would be really appreciated.<p>thanks!	2008-11-28 05:14:23 UTC		22	1

for those interested, mixcloud is an online audio hosting platform, focusing on long form audio. this initial launch covers basic site interaction (favorite/follow) and all our meta data. the api authenticated is oauth2 and json(p)/xml endpoints are provided.	2010-08-05 12:17:00 UTC		43	2

1373076	ask hn: how valuable to my resume is 5 years at microsoft?	there have been some interesting discussions here and on quora (http://www.quora.com/what-companies-teams-are-toxic-on-a-resume) about certain companies not being good for your resume or two much time at one of these companies not being good for your resume.<p>i have no college education so when i first started at microsoft when i was 22 i decided that i wanted to work there for 5 years and do well (best reviews possible, multiple promotions).  i also wanted to spend the time trying to influence microsoft as an organization to do something interesting in the linked data/semantic web space.  i am now a senior engineer and have pioneered the use of data semantics within bing. this experience feels extremely valuable as i pursue a longer career working with start-ups.<p>i am confident that i will complete my 5 years and meet my goals but i'm interested in better understanding how this experience will be perceived by members of the start-up community that i hope to be a part of in the future.<p>is it really perceived as a negative to work at an engineering organization like microsoft? what other things will be valuable to demonstrate on my resume as i look to enter the hacker community more actively?	2010-05-23 21:30:56 UTC		43	0

4166183	a day in the life of a startup founder	(the following is parody of recent posts, it is not meant as criticism of any individual but as commentary on what i see as an unhealthy obsession with the habits of others and of people taking themselves and others in the 'startup community' a bit too seriously)<p>0523 alarm sounds on my iphone 4gs.  i don't use just any alarm program: i use biorythym alarm system+ which monitors my internal body clock and starts ringing at the appropriate time before 0523 to begin an in tune start to the day.  it uses gregorian chants, nature sounds and recordings from inside the womb to ease me into the day.<p>0530 i'm in front of my macbook air (with 256gb ssd) at my desk made from recycled lumber from south african railway tracks.  why did i get up 7 minutes earlier?  because, as manic minute minder pro reminds me 7 minutes wasted per day 1.7 extra days of productive time per year. 1.7 days when the competition is literally sleeping!<p>i drink a large bowl of jing tea matcha supreme green and a glass of organic milk.  at 0533 every day i'm hacking through my email, todos, tweets and catching up on hacker news.  every 20 minutes time out reminds me to stop, meditate and focus.<p>0645 i walk into my bedroom with a green tea for my wife cassiopeia who is waking up.  we smile at each other and spend the next 15 minutes on one on one time.  at 0700 it's time to wake our two boys: dagwood and spaniel.<p>0800 the house is quiet but skype isn't. i stay in contact with my teams in costa rica, montreal and goa via skype throughout the day.  this morning check in with the teams gives me a good view of where the business is.  currently we're in double stealth mode (the public doesn't know what we're building and neither do we).<p>0830 i jog down to the ground floor of our new york brownstone and get on my trek madone 4 series bike for a 30 mile ride out into new jersey and back.  my iphone 4gs is cued up with a set of daily business podcasts set to run at double speed so i can get through all of them in the hour's ride.<p>0930 shower and then spiritual time.  i have a small shrine set up that allows me to focus on the important.  i light an incense and gaze up at posters of tim ferriss, kevin rose and warren buffet.<p>0945 the day really begins.  for here on in it's meetings, hirings, firings, networking with the new york vc and angel crowd until 1900 when c, d &#38; s (or cease and desist as i call them) come back home.  we eat together and at 2200 i'm in bed with a light cucumber mask and the alarm set for another day.<p>tonight's a little special because i've been invited to give a one hour keynote on being a startup ceo at velocipede ventures weekly pumped and primed meetup for other successful entrepreneurs like me.	2012-06-27 09:12:00 UTC		633	4

9450587	run goldy, run new highly addictive game with 10% proceeds going to charity	hey guys, i want to invite you to check out my new game, run goldy, run! it&#x27;s basically a 2d sidescroller based on dodging a never ending onslaught of enemies, with the twist of being able to run on the top or the bottom of the floor. it sounds confusing, but it&#x27;s completely intuitive once you get into it. there&#x27;s two basic controls, flip and shoot, blending the simplicity of games like flappy bird with the insane difficulty of...also flappy bird. it tells the simple story of a sheep with golden fleece who was born to run, and the eternal swarm of enemies who will stop at nothing to claim his precious pelt. anyway, it&#x27;s my first major game release and i&#x27;d really like to invite all of you to check it out on the appstore or my website, goldythesheep.com.<p>given that it&#x27;s my first real project and i have little to no experiencing designing games, i&#x27;m not anticipating to make a huge wad of cash off of it. however, 10% of whatever i do make off of content ads will be donated to charity, specifically children&#x27;s hospital in dallas. i&#x27;m a guy who likes to play games, and i made a game that i hope you will enjoy playing, but if that doesn&#x27;t grab you, you can also help the disadvantaged. that&#x27;s right, you can play an awesome game, support a budding indie studio, and help the poor, all at the same time!<p>so again, try it out, let me know what you think, and if you enjoy, please share. have a good run!	4

2672927	how does your surrounding  community impact the hacker zeitgeist?	pg has stated that while intelligence is hard to fake that determination is something where discernment of it is far more difficult to achieve correctly.<p>he's also emphasized the key role this plays in predicting success. coining terms such as "relentlessly resourceful" and emphasizing constant and responsive iteration as a great key to success. all this has accentuated in my mind the impact that a cultures ethics/morals play in fostering entrepreneurial activity/success.<p>this ranges the gamut from honesty to thrift and security as all being elements that can impact a culture or communities start-up mojo.<p>take, for example, my home of utah. lots of tech savvy entrepreneurial minded folks. yet, in my opinion, a hyper zealous thrift minded risk averse upper/upper middle class contributes (along with other factors i could name) to the problem of things like seed funding. people want to invest but their sensibilities keep them often from engaging in seed funding much of anything. (most ideas of "seed funding" here seem to demand an already in the marketplace profit gaining gig)<p>so my question to you, where ever you are, is<p>"what are aspects of your community that you believe impact the entrepreneurial spirit/fostering of innovation?"	2011-06-20 04:53:29 UTC		1	4

3701504	ask hn: go with what i got, stay the course, or learning the wrong stuff?	i got into startups as a sole 'business founder'.  even back then, those were slimey words to say to a coder, so i started writing, what i now know was bad, php in order to have something to show and convince real developers i wasn't another 'biz' guy w/o a clue and get them to join my team (for no money).  and it worked.<p>i've worked on my own startup projects for a few years full-time, building quick and dirty front-end mockups, wire-frames and writing middle-ware that needed to get done, to hit deadlines; while doing the biz dev, sales, customer dev, etc.<p>after a few years, a few projects, a lot of project management of small / agile teams and tons of customer development, product development and product marketing, i haven't made it on my own.  but, at best, i've become an okay, but unsuccessful startup founder.  turns out that while lots of startups claim they want entrepreneurial people, after working for an early stage startup, turns out that i make a better co-founder than 1st employee.<p>i'm trying to figure out what to do next and i've started teaching myself how to really code.  i gave up os x and windows, and am going cold turkey to ubuntu.  with that, i've been coding exclusively on vim (which is amazing &#38; amazingly complex) and learning to use an mvc, the right way.  but, i'm still coding in php (when i feel like i should be learning python).  coding is something i've always enjoyed, but i figured i should get better at it.<p>i've always been interested and really enjoy coding / building stuff.  however, am i wasting my time trying to build up my skills to get a job as a coder?  honestly, i'm not sure if i'm currently so low after my startup experience, that i'm pre-maturely giving up on using my product &#38; startup skills to get a job at either another startup or large company.<p>advice?	2012-03-14 02:20:56 UTC		1	1

2348605	twitter can make $45 million with little effort	i read somewhere that twitter has around 750,000 applications registered. they don't want people to build "clients" because that's their bread and butter, their way of making money.<p>i say, why don't you charge the app developers a nominal $5 per month per app. the most optimistic figure if all the apps registered right now agree to pay up would be $45 million a year. hey, that's a good start!<p>p.s. this will probably draw flak from a lot of app developers, but twitter can always build more features such as app analytics to justify the fee. i have a twitter app http://justunfollow.com and from the point of view of an app developer, i wouldn't mind paying a small fee to keep twitter running smooth.	2011-03-21 05:28:39 UTC		1	3

6300925	ask hn: how would you handle a potentially #1 mobile game?	firstly: yes, this could all be hot air, know-nothing ideas-guy type drivel that we&#x27;ve all seen before, but i&#x27;m asking you to make an assumption this is accurate and this potential does exist. i can easily find a hundred people to tell me that it&#x27;s probably not all that and i should just do it &amp; figure it out later, but that&#x27;s not what i&#x27;m after here. think of it as a thought exercise if you prefer.<p>now...<p>i&#x27;m working on a mobile game that i truly believe has the potential to hit the top of the app store charts. it&#x27;s a fun idea i&#x27;ve had for many years. i wanted to build it for the amiga many years ago but lacked the skills but it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for mobile devices - it&#x27;s one of those things where it seems the stars have just aligned. it has somewhat unique gameplay and there is currently nothing like it available.<p>however, i&#x27;ve never done anything like this before and i&#x27;m broke. absolutely flat broke. i have no money to market this whatsoever at the moment. so i&#x27;m wondering what the path would be for someone in my position. publisher? submit &amp; hope for the best?<p>main worries:<p>* due to lack of funds to promote, it languishes forgotten in the depths of the app store and no one ever sees it.<p>* clones. someone or someones see it, see the potential and knock up a clone, with marketing behind it and rake in the readies<p>i&#x27;m aware of the execution-is-everything mantra but this is a self-developed game. i just don&#x27;t have the resources to compete with studios out of the gate so i need a bit of help to avoid screwing myself up before i even begin.<p>so, tl;dr, if you had a really great mobile game ready to go, what would you do to maximise its potential?<p>thanks in advance!	2013-08-30 09:54:09 UTC		1	1
