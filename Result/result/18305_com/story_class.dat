as you will be able to tell, this is still rough and not polished (more or less a prototype).<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;thorly.batr.am&#x2f;<p>there are many commonly used flash files that are known to be vulnerable and are used all over the place regardless.	0
thorly aims to give you some idea about which files to avoid.<p>simply input a url or upload a flash file and it will check for common security problems (for example xss).	0
at the moment the user only gets information about whether the file is assumed to be vulnerable.<p>this will only be a short test run and i will probably take it down after a few hours (to scared to let it run on its own).	2015-02-27 17:01:09 UTC	1	0	3

i&#x27;m looking for a service or a way that shows content and details (e.g. is it free with my membership?) across different providers, even those that i don&#x27;t subscribe (e.g. hulu).  is something like this available?  if not, any suggestions (e.g. consolidate each providers api in one interface)?	2015-07-02 12:48:35 UTC	1	0	2

6601100	ask hn: linkedin profile as a doc or pdf?	recently, i came across a discussion with a recruiter wanting to have his job candidates linkedin profiles as document or pdf rather than sharing them as link. i know we could download our profile as pdf in linkedin, but for recruiters they usually screen hundreds of profiles a day.<p>is this a nice thing to have this tool developed and have some business model around on this? basically i want to validate this as idea if its feasible to invest sometime on development or not?	1
or we have something like this already on the market? provide your comment or suggestions and i am open to others related on this as well. thanks in advance.	2013-10-23 19:30:47 UTC	1	0	2

5980126	ask hn: what is your opinion about identity verification? necessary?	my startup is a peer to peer marketplace. i have been thinking about how to build trust and safety in the marketplace.  one of them is to do an offline identity verification such as id card, passport, driver license, etc.<p>what do you think of id verification? is it necessary? how do you build trust and safety?<p>also, i have been researching about firms that do id verification. i know that jumio, miicard and lexisnexis are some of them.  jumio is used by airbnb, so i contacted jumio and a rep replied to my inquiries immediately and asked several questions.  i answered that my startup is in stealth mode and, since then, it’s blank, 3 weeks have passed and no more update, i even sent a follow up email a week ago and to no avail.  it seems like jumio does not want my business.<p>so now i am considering lexisnexis and&#x2f;or miicard as an alternative.<p>have anyone use identity verification service with them and can you share your experience with them integrating it with your startup?<p>thanks.	2013-07-02 19:16:37 UTC	1	0	3

1962363	ask hn: advice on software contracting 	i'm in talks with another company that would like to use me as a contractor to build mobile applications for "their brand".  we had tentatively agreed to a ballpark _fixed_ price--we haven't signed anything yet.  however, there are 3 issues that are emerging:<p>* their concept of what features they "want" in their apps is extremely vague. i don't think they're being deceitful (planning to dump additional features on me at the last minute). rather, i think they genuinely don't have a vision for what they want and they would simply prefer that i "take care" of almost everything (more on this below).<p>* despite the lack of a _specific_ vision for what they want, there has already been some "feature-creep" and i'm concerned that the addition of features will blossom if we consummate the deal. the feature-creep is compounded by the fact that the feature requests are not fleshed-out, so when i see a new feature request i'm left wondering "how much will it take to implement feature x?"  when i ask them for additional detail, it's clear that they don't have a clear vision of what they want.<p>* it also seems that they would prefer it if i just ran/maintained the applications on my own (they don't want to be bothered with the technical headaches).  however, these applications require at least 1 remote server (the applications will routinely query a remote database), so what initially seemed like a "build us some mobile apps" contract is turning into a "build us some apps and an infrastructure and maintain everything" contract.<p>my gut instinct is to convert this into an hourly "pay as we go" contract.  however, i don't want to completely turn the tables on them over the fixed price and i'm trying to come up with a hybrid approach. i'd like to structure something that protects <i>me</i> against feature-creep and something that protects <i>them</i> against slipping deadlines.<p>so, my questions are:<p>1) any general advice on how to proceed?<p>2) has anyone structured contracts like this: "i'll build you a piece of software with features x y z.  i expect that it will take me 6 weeks of full-time work and i will charge $a. any additional feature requests or revisions beyond those features are billed at $b.<p>thanks for any insight!	2010-12-02 15:21:09 UTC	1	0	0

8884588	what is your opinion on open source foundations and people that run them?	currently, openstack foundation elections are in progress. the candidate list contains some well known names as well as some lesser known in the openstack community. what is really interesting to see is how serious the candidates are about running for the elections. twitter is over-flowing with self promotions (naturally) and even some pretty clever posters, just search for &quot;openstack board&quot;. https:&#x2f;&#x2f;twitter.com&#x2f;search?q=openstack%20board&amp;src=typd&amp;mode=photos<p>these are all people employed by large corporations trying to get the votes from people employed by other large corporations. it would really interesting to see if an independent (from large companies) candidate would actually win this type of election.<p>what is your opinion on open source foundations and people that run them?	2015-01-14 06:01:09 UTC	1	0	2

what would you use? a framework like bootstrap or foundation, or sass directly...? i would like to avoid javascript as much as possible as it&#x27;s a multiple page application.	2015-08-13 11:47:05 UTC	1	1	3

869780	should i offer equity to a potential business partner? 	a single, non-technical founder comes up with a startup idea and recruits an offshore development team to build version 1. the product is popular and 10,000 users sign up and feedback is promising. the founder has some new ideas to improve the product and a business model to earn revenue for the next version. at this point all expenses have been paid for by the founder.<p>the founder and dev team work together part-time over 3-4 months on a new version that includes new features and enhancements. the founder can no longer afford labor costs, so he decides to negotiate an equity deal with the development firm to create new features, and pay for the recent enhancements.<p>the offshore team is involved in other consulting projects and requires detailed functional/non-functional requirements, micromangement, and communication is infrequent and strained by time zone differences. the founder questions the firm's level of technical talent and their ability to scale/optimize in anticipation of rapid growth and an angel funding round.<p>the owner of the offshore team offers 2 dedicated, full time developers for a time period of 4-to-n months in exchange for ownership in the startup.<p>what would you do? how much stake should the original founder retain? should the development team be treated as cofounders or investors? how much equity stake would you offer the offshore team? would you re-recruit a new team of developers/founders onshore to rebuild the product?	2009-10-08 19:40:44 UTC	1	1	0

6330428	how to get an amazing website for $99/mo.	so we&#x27;ve been dealing with the consulting cash flow roller coaster for some time now and decided generating more recurring revenue was probably a smart move.<p>one idea we had (thanks to advice&#x2f;guidance from the likes of brennan dunn, nathan barry, amy hoy, and patrick mackenzie) was consulting as a service. we realized there were many business owners out there who struggled with the various template sites (wordpress, wix, web.com) but didn&#x27;t have thousands to spend on custom development.<p>so we created a simple $99&#x2f;month package which included everything clients needed (design, updates, and hosting) via squarespace. the price point seems to be working well so far and clients get a quasi-custom site built without having to deal with anything tech related which they love.<p>curious what everyone thinks of the concept (good and bad)?	2013-09-04 20:56:40 UTC	1	1	2

3938244	youtube movie maker, windows movie maker is not the only choice	no matter for amateurs or professional movie maker directors, windows movie maker should be one of the necessities in the course of creating and editing video or movies. though it’s powerful and how can we say “almighty”, it still holds some drawbacks like lack of “voiceover” function. many users in yahoo answer will ask the similar questions “where can i record my voice and insert to wlmm?” (for some green hands of course)or “where is the voiceover button?” (for some experienced users most of time). actually if you tried all the functions of wlmm, you will figure out that there is no such kind of function, but you can make webcam record do if you don’t mind to show your face in your video. another option can be picked up, if you insist to use this software, you can try to record your voice via microphone with other record software and save it in your pc in advance and then insert it to your windows movie maker. done! but the live experience should be much inferior to others.<p>leave the drawbacks of windows movie maker, the function of posting in youtube and other social websites should be one of the shinny parts. in my opinion, there is over 40% users being enamoured of wlmm due to this powerful reason. however, because of some limitations to input and output formats and some sophisticated operating steps, especially for some greenhands, this youtube movie maker can’t meet needs to some extent. more information at:http://jennykimmy.multiply.com/journal/item/1/youtube_movie_maker_windows_movie_maker_is_not_the_only_choice	2012-05-07 08:59:44 UTC	1	-1	1

3546157	norton medical and scientific research & biotechnology	norton medical and scientific research &#38; biotechnology - fda approves kidney cancer drug from pfizer&#60;p&#62;by admin, 4 days ago	0
the medicine made by pfizer against advanced kidney cancer was recently approved by norton medical and scientific research &#38; biotechnology regulators for commercial use despite a warning of possible side effects.	4
on friday, the food and drug administration (fda) stated that the drug (with the generic name of axitinib) is effective in curing patients who do not show response to other drugs against kidney cancer.	0
the advance stage of kidney cancer usually begins in the lining of the kidney's tubes. inlyta does its work by blocking specific receptors that are involved in the growth of tumor.	4
according to fda, inlyta is already the seventh drug it approved to cure advanced cancer of the kidney since 2005.	3
american cancer society said that more than 60,000 americans are diagnosed with kidney cancer last year and 1 out of 5 is expected to die from them.	2
the fda approval has come as a welcome opportunity for pfizer since they have lost revenue from their cholesterol drug, lipitor, after generic counterparts started to come out last year.	2
however, inlyta will still face tough competition from the 6 other drugs for kidney cancer that have their respective market shares already.	0
an advisory committee of fda endorsed the oral drug last month and announced that it is as effective and as safe as the kidney cancer medication from bayer ag, nexavar.	1
generally, in clinical trials made by norton medical and scientific research &#38; biotechnology, inlyta slowed the growth of cancer by 2 months versus nexavar for patients who have already been cured for renal cell carcinoma.	4
however, the results differed based on what certain medicines patients have taken prior. for people who took first the sutent (also from pfizer), inlyta slowed the spread of disease only by one and a half months, compared to the more than 5 months for patients treated with cytokines beforehand.	4
most of the advisers of fda stated that the drug does not have a huge advantage over others. however, the fact that it has different side effects than the other medicine in the market could be an important deciding factor for patients.	3
several of the most common side effects of using inlyta include high blood pressure, weight loss, vomiting, loss of voice and diarrhea. some patients also reported bleeding problems that can possibly lead to fatality in extreme cases.	4
fda issued a warning to patients with high blood pressure, intestinal bleeding, or untreated brain tumors in their intake of inlyta.	0
meanwhile, pfizer is conducting further tests of inlyta for liver cancer treatment.	2012-02-03 07:04:19 UTC	2	1	3

3476306	on the guilt associated with leaving your job	i taught myself how to become a front-end developer while i was in the army. i left the army in 2010, and started freelancing, where i got tired of dealing with low-budget clients and working from home. serendipitously (or so i thought at the time), i found a position at the director level with a local agency, where i was able to make some immediate improvements to both operations and the bottom line, but eventually ran into a lot of resistance going any further. i also reached the point where i could no longer do all of the work on my own and we needed to reach out and hire people. it sounds great, but the assets at my disposal are simply not enough to make a compelling offer to applicants, thus i find myself in an ongoing battle with deadlines and the people that set them.<p>to make a long story short, i told my boss that i felt undervalued and that because of certain archaic processes, we were not as efficient and profitable as i thought we could become. let's just say that the conversation didn't go my way.<p>so i find myself in a pickle. there are solvable problems that don't want to be solved, and i'm not getting paid enough to solve them. however, i'm not the kind to just take a paycheck and call it a day (like many of you i imagine).<p>the only way i can improve my situation is by leaving my job, which i plan on doing. the problem is that i feel guilty about it, almost like i'm giving up or not doing all i could to resolve these conflicts. the boss has a 5 year plan, but i'm not keen on waiting 5 years...i don't have the time.<p>my question to you is whether any of you have been in similar situations, and if so, what action did you take? did you regret moving on, or did you regret staying too long?<p>of course, i'm building on the side, but the projects aren't making quite enough money yet for me to outright quit. very close though.<p>thoughts are welcome.	2012-01-17 20:21:11 UTC	2	5	0

2589968	warning, prostitutes hunting at zynga sf	i work down the street from the new zynga offices in sf (townsend b/w 7th and 8th) and frequent the area for coffee/lunch/banking etc.  about a week ago i noticed a familiar, very attractive blond in a short leather skirt, heavy make-up, giving a lot of looks to people in passing.  something seemed off.  then another day i noticed another super attractive girl looking lost and slutty, hanging out bumming a cigarette from a zynga employee... for some reason she reminded me of a girl from the o'farrell theater area (strip club downtown) and then i thought, no way, they're on to the nerdy new hires with ipo stock potential, they are hunting!  haha, i've spotted two more lurkers, only took about 30 minutes to pick them out during lunch hours.  just a heads up zynga.  btw, you hiring any technical advisors with a careful eye for danger?  i’m local  hehe	3

9377352	ask hn: intentionally inject errors into nfs to test user client	we have a software client that is being deployed into different it environments. this client reads and writes files and thus has to handle a variety of different filesystem&#x2f;networking conditions. most customers&#x27; filesystems are mounted via nfs and a lot of times we encounter problems reading and&#x2f;or writing files in certain directories because of nfs delays and improperly configured nfs permissions.<p>i&#x27;m looking for ways to intentionally inject  errors (nfs&#x2f;networking&#x2f;etc.) in our test environment so we can better handle such conditions.<p>searching around, i found mentions of a linux kernel configuration item called config_nfsd_fault_injection that supposedly allows &quot;manual injection of faults&quot; but i&#x27;ve been unable to find a working example so far.<p>fellow hn-ers, what have you done or what would you do in such a scenario? any advice is much appreciated!	2015-04-14 21:05:10 UTC	4	0	0

1078750	ask hn: recommend me a cms/blogging platform	hello, you wonderful people! i'm in the middle of a massive portfolio redesign. i've completed the design; now i'm looking for an engine that's powerful enough to run it.<p>i'm wondering if you can recommend me a tool. i've got a few things i need:<p>* it has to be comfortable with multiple page layouts. i use three for different purposes, and so i need something that can display some pages with one layout, and other pages with another.<p>* it needs to give me flexibility in how my content is displayed. i've got two major content categories, and each one is shown on the index page in a rather unique fashion. i need something that makes styling output easy, and that's flexible enough to accept multiple content categories.<p>* it's got to have something more flexible than title-body layout. i need extra categories with which to manipulate things.<p>none of these three things are unique; however, i need a system that lets me do all of them at once. i know drupal can do it, but drupal is heavy. is there something lighter that does all that? much thanks for your advice.	2010-01-26 20:31:39 UTC	5	3	2

784038	is ai dead?	i've been reading "the singularity is near" by ray kurzweil and scanning his sources. one thing that struck me was that things like neural nets hadn't made very much progress since i was an ma grad student 17 years ago. back then, kohonen networks were the rage and as far as i can tell, there isn't anything terribly more interesting today.<p>now, i actually wish, i hope, that this isn't so. perhaps i've missed something but it seems like rather than advance any prospects of honestly intelligent machines, both academic and industry research now, in 2009, concentrates on extending what already exists - better languages, incrementally better algorithms, better simulations, better databases and better hardware.<p>to my mind, this doesn't stand in the way of something like "the singularity" but it means that if such a thing occurs, it will be with something like the blue brain project - simulating the brain without understanding it. this may indeed work but, strangely enough, it means experimenting with processes which we really don't understand and thus makes something ... dum dum da ... skynet actually seem disturbingly plausible...<p>but that's a side issue. big topic - "is ai, artificial intelligence, dead?" yea or nea?	2009-08-25 03:13:46 UTC	5	7	1

1344478	challenge hn: a reference implementation of hn on different platforms?	hello hn,<p>this thread: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1342353 has got me thinking.<p>that usually leads to nothing, but this time something popped out that may be workable.<p>i'd like to propose a 'reference' implementation of a non-toy website on various platforms, showing what the best practice way is of solving the various challenges that you run in to when creating a web based application.<p>the goal is to get a common problem solved many times over for comparison purposes. it can help with learning a new platform (i think the main goal) when coming from a platform that you already know, so you are concentrating on studying the platform and the solutions when you already understand the problem.<p>sort of a rosetta's stone for web applications.<p>the idea itself is not original, in the middle ages of computing a guy called lance leventhal had a series of assembly language books that would re-implement the same programs on different platforms and it helped a lot when switching from one architecture to another to have both implementations in front of you.<p>because we are all very familiar with the hn website i'd propose that we would spec hn down to the last bolt with respect to how it works as experienced by the user, and then use that to build the various implementations off.<p>some languages may have more than one implementation (for instance, because there are multiple frameworks or because someone rolled their own or did not use a framework at all), but that only adds to the general body of knowledge of how things are 'done' in a certain environment.<p>is this a viable idea?<p>any takers?	2010-05-13 15:18:39 UTC	6	4	2

1408294	ask hn: skills required for a good tech project manager	a friend of mine (no, really, a friend, not me pretending to be 'a friend of mine' - i'm very happy as i am) is wondering about moving into tech project management - ideally a pm role in a web dev agency / webapp startup.<p>he's got a lot of experience in journalism/publishing as an editor (in the management sense) and already has a lot of applied, down-to-earth project management experience on large, busy titles. (ie, he's got an excellent track record for getting things done, rather than just having been to lots of managementspeak courses and shuffling excel documents).<p>so, i don't doubt that he's up to the job in terms of organisational skills, but he's obviously aware that he's not got a software background. he is above-averagely computer/web savvy, and has researched written and/or edited some tech-lite white papers in the past. i reckon he could get up to speed with what he needs to know relatively quickly, in his own time, before trying to make a move.<p>but what would hners say is essential sector-specific knowledge that he'd need to be a good tech pm?<p>my list so far includes:<p>* scrum, agile and familiarity with waterfall (so you know why to avoid it)<p>* web standards, incl html5<p>* web accessibility<p>* awareness of testing/qa approaches (tdd, unit testing, browser-based macro testing, acceptance criteria)<p>* job ticketing and task tracking (ie, a step up from manual/offline progress tracking)<p>* a good understanding of the full web stack (conceptually, not hands-on hacking)<p>* but.. basic unixery (for pushing releases live/restarting servers in emergencies)<p>* good channels for learning about what's new and interesting (and therefore may be stuff clients ask for, or would like to hear about)<p>what else would you recommend?<p>cheers,	2

7558210	semi amusing development stories	well last night was a fun evening. spent over a hour (billable time) explaining to a client i was not being rude within their project code.<p>how did this come about? well the client asked to see their project and being a good obedient developer i complied. i opened up a remote desktop share session and got down to it. so i showed them their project and all was good all be it a few textual changes.<p>so i cracked open the project folder &lt;website&gt;.git. wait, stop, &quot;why has my project got the word git at the end of it? is this what you think?&quot; at this point i think the word which came out my mouth was &quot;errmm, huhh what?&quot;. to cut a long story short i had to explain that i didnt think he was a git (nor his project) and that in fact it was a technology.<p>disaster inverted!<p>well until he saw the grunt folder (and my push script grunt-onto). at this point he must have been tired and decided he had enough of gits and grunts and called an end to the meeting saying &quot;how disappointed he was with my humours attempts in this `oh so important` project&quot;. i then had to craft an email to him with links to the project websites to prove in fact i was not being a <i></i><i></i> but they are actually technologies.<p>\<i>\</i> slaps head <i>&#x2f;</i>&#x2f;<p>have you ever had any misunderstandings involving project terminology or a client who just didnt get it; or is it always just me?*<p>virtual punch in the head for the person who first mentions forking.	2014-04-09 08:09:16 UTC	7	5	0

1181182	ask hn: what % of equity should a cto get?	hi all, i'm a hn regular posting anonymously because this contains sensitive information.<p>short version: i've been managing everything technical for my friend's startup, and was asked to join as a cto, in exchange for equity. what % should i ask for?<p>long version: this startup is run by my very good friend. he is an amateur coder, and developed the code base himself part time over a few years. when he was ready to invest $ to make the site grow, he brought me on board on a consulting basis. i found, hired &#38; currently manage a small team to work on the site, and he pays for the budget. before i came on board, the code base was pretty terrible: all the development was being done in real-time on production server, never any testing, full of bugs, etc. when i came in, i did stuff like introduce version control, create a staging server, code/schema refactoring, automated testing suite, automated builds, bug/issue tracking, etc. i also manage the team itself, and we regularly have informal meetings where we talk about high-level stuff for the site's direction - you get the idea.<p>right now, i put in about 10-15 hours of work a week, out of which i bill for about 5, using a heavily discounted rate (about 1/3 of what i bill others), because it's my very good friend. before i came on board, the site was developing slowly, but since then it's been growing at a very good organic pace. it is making some money already - not much, about $200 per month, and it has about 1000 daily users. it's not profitable by a long shot (obviously a dev team of 4-5 people costs a lot more), but i believe it has the potential to be in the future.<p>i want to offer that i don't take any $ myself, contribute about 15 hours a week and take a %. my friend (who is the only owner with 100% equity, btw) have a great relationship, and he actually brought up bringing me in as a cto himself, but all talks about money are uncomfortable (for me), especially with friends, so i wanted to ask here - in this situation, what's a fair % to ask? some examples with references would be ideal. or some kind of a formula that makes sense to calculate it.<p>any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks!!!	2010-03-10 16:07:59 UTC	8	5	0

but i have a slightly different perspective.<p>i am a rising senior at upenn studying cs and business, and i have the opportunity to "submatriculate" to get a master's in cs.  it would be one extra year.<p>i have worked on some interesting projects, but nothing huge.  i want to work at or create tech startups for my career.<p>if some entrepreneurial opportunity opens up, i'll take that hands down, but i think it's likely i'll have to choose between a job at microsoft/google/amazon/etc and a master's.  would the extra year at a big tech company or the degree be better for my long-term goals?<p>many thanks for your thoughts.	2009-08-22 18:56:50 UTC	8	12	1

(paraphrased)<p>--<p>when he was a graduate in an mba program he invented a program that would allow students to upload papers over the internet to their teachers.  he showed it to some schools and vcs and they wondered why anyone would need that.  however, a teacher thought it was a great idea, and blackboard was born.<p>he tried to raise money from several vcs, but they turned him down.  “i went to 50 meetings with 50 different vcs and i can assure you vcs do not invest in companies that are looking for money to develop their product.”<p>they found an investor that was a friend of a friend’s brother’s sisters’ wife’s husband…  they heard he might invest in the space, and kept harassing him until he said yes.<p>early on they found another company doing the same thing (a bunch of graduate students as well) and they merged together doubling the size of the company.<p>for him it was all about sales.  to get started they gave away the product to 2 schools.  then sold it super cheap to 2 schools.  from there they sold it to ten at full price, and so on.<p>if you can sell it once, you can sell it ten times, if you can sell it ten times, you can sell it 100 times.<p>a lot of teachers approach him and say “i really want to come work for you.  the online education space is the future.”  he asks two questions: can you program?  can you sell?  if you can’t do either then you don’t bring any value to the company.<p>the product is never finished.  when bb started to grow, they had competitors with better products.  it didn’t matter.  they outsold the competition (and eventually bought them out.)<p>fb, twitter, google they won the lottery.  companies can win the lottery too.  he had a friend that was a plumber and won 10 million in the lottery.  if he was going to do something that was advertising based, he would rather quit, become a plumber, and try to win the lottery.<p>the most important thing: sell, sell, sell.	2009-03-30 17:49:23 UTC	12	4	1

178279	ask yc: help in negotiating my stake in a start-up	i have been asked to join a start-up recently and will be the 5th member. the original founders go back about 18 months and have up to now been the driving force behind the business. i have been offered a 2% stake with share options to 4%. this is the same as was offered to the 4th member. the 3 original founders each have 31% each. the remaining 3% is to go to certain other smaller investors.<p>this is a banking services/technology start-up and i am to be the legal and compliance director,i am a banking lawyer by profession.<p>my gut feeling is that i am not being offered enough equity here and that there is too much disparity between my % and the original founder's 30.1%. i had expected to receive nearer to 8%.<p>we will shortly be approaching angels/vcs for round 1 funding and the 3 founders proposals is that they will dilute their shareholdings for the vc etc and my stake will be protected from dilution at all stages.<p>does this seem fair and equitable to you guys or am i being ripped off here? i have thought about it so much i can't think clearly about it at the moment. i am taking no salary and working for "free" in return for this stake, though i will get some salary though much below market rate probably year 2 or 3.	2008-05-01 09:46:32 UTC	14	28	2

</code></pre>	4
i'm still working on the lesson content, but most of the moving parts are in place. it's built using gwt and google app engine. despite the recent spate of gae-related postings here, i've been able to make app engine work fairly well for my needs and team size (i.e. me). right now my only remaining pain point is the lack of ssl for non-appspot.com domains. ugh.<p>quick brown frog was very much influenced by patio11- consumer-oriented, and born of personal experience. a year ago, i decided to learn to type properly, and tried to download software from <i>the</i> major vendor of typing software.  it turned out to be a weird pc/mac hybrid package, and i had to go hunting for a dated uncompression tool just to open the .sit file.<p>when i finally got it uncompressed, i found it was <i>years</i> out of date and would not run on my mac. i ended up having to order a cdrom version from them in order to get the latest software that would run on my system. (why offer the dated download at all?!)<p>thus was my inspiration to create a totally browser-based typing tutor. i'm blogging about the development process at http://quickbrownfrog.wordpress.com.<p>feedback greatly appreciated.	2010-11-23 14:21:15 UTC	27	33	0

7733249	ask hn: as an experienced dev, how do you learn a language/framework quickly?	background:	1
i&#x27;ve been coding off and on for 2+ decades, starting from basic to c&#x2f;c++ to rails&#x2f;node. languages and frameworks change quickly, and i&#x27;m still not thrilled with the resources available to learn as an experienced developer. for example, i&#x27;m confident that i should be able to do a fair bit of ios development with a week or two of hard work given my knowledge of c&#x2f;c++, rails, node.<p>my challenges with existing tools:<p>- books are pretty verbose and don&#x27;t do a great job covering popular libraries (e.g., the top npm&#x2f;cocoapods&#x2f;gems that are part of so many startup products)<p>- a ton of articles + samples online are designed for novice programmers approaching a language<p>- online videos are super slow moving (even when you speed up playback)<p>- progressively more difficult sample code would be great - but it&#x27;s hard to find the right progression and most are missing the annotation that explain the vagaries of the language or framework<p>- perusing reference docs for the purposes of learning is too &#x27;exhaustive search&#x27; (e.g., why isn&#x27;t there a doc for say underscore.js that rank orders functions by incidence of use)<p>i&#x27;d love to hear what the hn community does - with a focus on learning a language + framework by experienced engineers for the purpose of building startup products (i.e., not simply for the purpose of becoming a language&#x2f;framework expert but rather to build something as quickly as possible).	2014-05-12 15:25:34 UTC	144	66	2

4097260	ask hn: how to protect myself as a 4th tech founder?	hello,	4
i am a veteran tech person (backend developer) and was approached by 3 business people who know me from way back regarding an idea they had. they are looking for someone to help them implement it or at least a prototype with which they could ask for funds. the idea is viable and has something to it, and those people <i>are</i> connected in the right places to push this forward if they like. so unlike most offers gotten before this seems viable. my question is, if i decide to put the time and join them, how can i protect myself/minimize future risks (such as dilution), being a minority in this group [1/4 founder]? are there any online sources or books how to handle such scenarios?<p>notes:<p>* i am aware that the optimal way to go would be to find founders you trust, unfortunately some times for various reasons you need to settle for less.<p>* i assume there is no full proof solution, i just want to know what i can best.<p>* i assume most of those rules would apply for non-tech founders too, but what i am interested in knowing about (if such exists), are unique clauses that can protect tech founders in particular<p>thank you and hope this will help others too	2012-06-11 21:54:43 UTC	1	0	0

3834782	flip the process flow around	no matter what life cycle model a team runs, the flow of change generally occurs as such: developer checks out code, make incremental change, performs incremental tests, submits change, continuous integration then performs build, test, deploy to qa. from a process perspective the majority of tasks that occur once the developer checks in code is symptom identification. continuous integration is symptom identification, it is a defensive process, defending against failure. consider the cost of all post development task and ask what percentage of effort and activity goes towards identifying symptoms and defending against failure. now consider this approach. the development team creates a reference product that is a close a possible to a production deployment. developers all have access to checking out a reference product, making incremental change, performing incremental test, or full on automated test (that would normally be performed post developer checkin) prior to checkin (this is called pre-integration) -- when the developer check their changes in -- they in affect are checking in a reference product -- now more activity downstream is focused on audit and tailoring the reference product (less efforts on identifying symptoms more effort on adding value). all downstream teams also move upstream ahead of development. their charter as an upstream team is to deliver into development everything that is necessary to produce a reference product and deliver a reference product successfully into continuous integration (they are adding value to the developers productivity and accuracy). now qa instead of primarily being a symptom identification effort has become a pro-active value added provider into development and an auditor on outputs. this will significantly reduce the context switching which in turn improves developer rhythm. it will also improve the ability for the development team to pivot, whether large or small. what this does is engage the architects and developer in the end-to-end process as we've moved the developer closer to deployment, and the downstream folks, upstream where they play a huge role in the success of development versus developing tools and process to defend against failure. we'll start to see where most of the tools we've used for years are symptom identification tools and need to be revisited to become value add tools. bdd and tdd are examples of value add tools/practices. continuous integration as practiced today is a symptom identification tool -- it needs to be turned into a value add tool	2012-04-13 00:17:12 UTC	1	0	2

137255	ranting about java...	my current job is test automation, coding in 4-test, the test automation language in the silktest platform owned by borland. this is pretty good, even an industry standard for test automation for gui apps, though it has limitations. so we had some date/time stuff to do which we wrote in java which would be called from the silk test script. problem is as i'm sure most of y'all know, java differs from build to build, and the latest java version is not always the "greatest". so our java routines being called work on some boxes, and not on others - the process fails to be killed upon completion. since the whole point about test automation is not having to "babysit" test runs, we needed something that wasn't going to be russian roulette as to wether it would work or not. so i wrote up a couple dll's in c++ to replace the java classes being called, and they work like a charm. don't get me wrong - i like java - easy to use and good for writing up lots of code fast - just i think the recent experience is turning me into a bit of a c++ "snob", lol. and i found a cool ide for it too - open source - http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html - lots easier than visual c++ for my money, and it has all the unix libs included.<p>anyhoo with all the modern "high level" languages out there, thought fairness might demand one put in a "plug" for what could still be the best oo language out there! :-)	2008-03-14 23:55:47 UTC	1	0	3

2547509	what are the ux/ui considerations for expanding text fields in ios app design?	hello,&#60;p&#62;the following question was raised by me on quora (http://qr.ae/evsn) :&#60;p&#62;what are the background graphic/s considerations for expanding text fields in iphone applications?&#60;p&#62;i have created background ui assets for text fields but there is a good chance that the height might not be sufficient for lengthy text inputs even on wrapping them.&#60;p&#62;it would be great if anyone could point me in the right direction to pre-emptively resolve this problem and incorporate the solution in all further ui endeavors :).&#60;p&#62;i look forward to your response.&#60;p&#62;cheers,	4

7192275	ask hn: is single founder startup really frown upon / despised?	i applied to couple of accelerators and got shot down.<p>i am pretty sure the startup idea got their attention (i have shown my startup here and generally it is a positive feedback), however i think why i got denied is probably due to single founder.<p>why is that single founder frown upon in the industry?  while i understand single founder has twice as much work, but i also think if they can build the startup from ground up to launch, it shows that they are capable of running the business.<p>a bit about me. i am a business founder with product management background. i do have engineering background, but not in web coding.  i build the startup myself by writing requirement, testing, everything that a tech co founder (cto) can do except writing codes. i outsource the development using freelancers. i have few marketing strategies on how to spread the words out. as people usually say, product manager is like a mini ceo. i understand the mechanics of how it works, why it works, and how to run it.<p>the other reason i am a single founder now is because i want to prove to my future cto (tech co founder) that i have what it takes to run the startup.  without a web background, it is hard to attract or gather interests from a savvy web programmer, so i think it is necessary for me to show them that i understand it.<p>what is your take on this?	2014-02-06 19:10:36 UTC	1	8	2

4033518	obat penyakit keputihan herbal	keputihan????? sakit, resih, nggak pd dan lain sebagainya, itulah yang di rasakan tatkala sedang keputihan. sudah banyak berbagai obat untuk mengobati keputihan, namun perlu anda ketahui bahwa tidak semua obat aman untuk anda konsumsi apalagi obat-obatan yang di jual di pasaran bebas dan terbuka. berbeda dengan obat penyakit keputihan herbal yang aman tanfa menimbulkan efeksamping apapun. karena obat herbal ace maxs di buat oleh para ahli bioteknologi dan di racik secara modern namun kualitas dan keasliannya tetap di jaga.<p>sekilas mengenai keputihan :<p>istilah “keputihan” merupakan istilah lazim digunakan oleh masyarakat untuk menyebut penyakit kandidiasis vagina yang terjadi pada daerah kewanitaan. penyakit “keputihan” merupakan masalah kesehatan yang spesifik pada wanita. sebuah survei telah dilakukan terhadap pengunjung wanita pada beberapa apotek di yogyakarta selama satu bulan menunjukkan bahwa 60% pengunjung wanita tersebut sedang atau pernah menggunakan obat untuk mengatasi masalah kesehatan pada organ reproduksinya dan yang relatif sering adalah apa yang dikenal dengan “keputihan”. sebanyak 50% pelajar putri sekolah menengah dan perguruan tinggi pernah mengalami keputihan ketika berusia kurang dari 25 tahun.<p>bagaimana mengenali kandidasis vaginal?	1
“keputihan” paling umum disebabkan oleh jamur candida,spp, terutama candida albicans yang menginfeksi secara superfisial atau terlokalisasi. penyakit ini seringkali dalam istilah medis disebut candidiasis vaginal atau vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc) atau vaginitis candida albinacans. “keputihan” dapat disertai gejala atau tanpa ada gejala yang dirasakan, tetapi jika dilakukan pembiakan sekret vagina akan terlihat adanya jamur candida, spp. selain candida albicans, penyebab lain adalah candida glabrata yang kasusnya mempunyai kecenderungan meningkat.	1
seringkali wanita merasa mampu mengenali sendiri bahwa sedang menderita keputihan tanpa merasa perlu memeriksakan diri ke dokter untuk memperoleh pemeriksaan secara lebih detail, namun langsung diobati sendiri dengan obat – obat keputihan yang dijual bebas. pada kasus ini, tindakan tersebut cukup berisiko, karena apabila kurang tepat dalam pengenalan penyakitnya dapat menyebabkan kurang tepat pula obat yang dipilih, sehingga selain efektivitas terapi tidak tercapai juga akan berisiko pada munculnya resistensi sehingga jamur semakin kebal dengan obat.	1
tindakan swamedikasi hanya direkomendasikan jika sebelumnya telah pernah didiagnosis keputihan oleh dokter dan kembali muncul gejala yang sama atau mengalami kekambuhan.<p>obat penyakit keputihan herbal ace maxs merupakan obat herbal yang ampuh dan mampu mengobati berbagai penyakit selain keputihan, karena obat penyakit keputihan herbal terbuat dari dua herbal yang mempunya zat yang sanagat baik untuk  mengobati berbagai penyakit yaitu ektra kulit manggis yang mengandung xamthone dan ektra daun sirsak yang tidak jauh beda manfaat dan khasiatnya dengan xamthone sehingga dari keduanya dipadukan menjadi satu kemasan ace maxs.<p>xamthone mempunyai peranan :<p><pre><code>    sebagai anti bakteri	4
kemampuan lain dari xanthone adalah mematikan bakteri. beberapa peneliti tentang manfaat xanthone memperlihatkan bahwa xamthone bersifat antimikroba terhadap mrsa(methicilin resistant staphylococcus aureus), yaitu bakteri yang kebal terhadap obat antibiotik yang dapat menyebabkan infeksi farah. penyakit akibat rmsa memang tidaak di kenal di indonesia. namun di beberapa negara, seperti amerika, bakteri ini sangat menakutkan karena dalam waktu singkat akan memakan sel-sel tubuh manusia. bakteri ini dapat meneyebabkan cacat fisik dan kematian pada para penderitanya. dikutif dari buku  “dahsyatnya manggis untuk menumpas penyakit, karangan dr.ir. raffi paramawati,msi, halaman 61“	3
sebagai anti jamur	3
xanthones yang terkandung dalam jus manggis juga memiliki kemampuan untuk menghambat aktivitas kapang atau jamur. penyebab penyakit atau fitophatogenik. beberapa contohnya adalah fusarium oxyporum v, alternaria tenius, dan dreschlera oryzae (cochliobolus miyabeanu). penelitian yang dilakukan oleh geetha dan gopalakrishnan juga membuktikan hal tersebut,“dikutif dari buku  “dahsyatnya manggis untuk menumpas penyakit, karangan dr.ir. raffi paramawati,msi, halaman 63“	1

few months ago there were lots of posts on hn related to passive income. this gave me thought about having passive income which will give enough freedom to work on my own ideas&#x2f;project fulltime.	0
in india one can easily live on $500&#x2f;month, so keeping that in mind i have setup a timeline of 12-18 months(which i think should be enough) to generate that much amount.	1
right now i don&#x27;t have any savings which i can invest to earn and i&#x27;ve free time available around weekends.i am working on few ideas of my own, but those will not necessarily generate income.	1
so what would you do suggest me to do?	2015-09-04 06:52:34 UTC	2	0	1

40742	why social networks use bidirectional links even though unidirectional links may be better	i think the main reason is simply to get people to invite their friends to the site, thus increasing the number of users via peer pressure.<p>for specialty social networks (or specialties within a general social networking site), your friends are probably not the best people to connect to.  in that case, it would probably be better to use unidirectional links so that you can "subscribe" to anyone whom you would like to learn from.<p>yet these unidirectional links -- while better suited in such cases -- are not great in attracting people to the site.  and so such sites probably won't get enough critical mass to be interesting.<p>it seems to me that friend requests should act as subscriptions.  they could then be upgraded to bidirectional links if the friend request is accepted.<p>moreover, such links should not designate friendship at all, but rather, interest in keeping in touch with someone's activities (e.g., their subscriptions to groups, the apps they add to their profile, etc.).<p>you could use some sort of reward to encourage people to invite their friends that has nothing to do with these links.	2

1403729	where are the interesting tech jobs?	i'm getting bummed out with my silicon valley tech startup. the business side is going smoothly, but the engineering side is boring me to death. we started off with some cool new technologies, but since then we've constantly been hacking in incremental features and accruing technical debt. i don't see much point in what i'm doing, and i feel like my skills and credentials are going to waste. what scares me most about this is it could be the story of any startup!<p>thus i ask you, hacker news, where are the interesting tech jobs?<p>i'm looking for something that hearkens back to the better part of my many years in graduate school (intellectually curious open-minded colleagues, the opportunity to work on something new, and the time to do it right), but applied to real problems of known importance, not just whatever my 25-year-old self thought sounded impressive enough to publish.	2010-06-04 07:34:56 UTC	2	0	4

2450381	ask hn: how do b2c "free-tilities" like evite make money?	i'm building a b2c utility which addresses a frequent consumer pain point, should be fun to use, but at the end of the day is just that...a fun utility but not something you would pay a monthly / one time fee to use.<p>i'm curious what the business model for companies like evite is. is it just "build it and they will come...and click on ads"? is it direct-sale of ads?<p>i expect the traffic and interactions on the utility to result in very targeted ads, but the idea of relying on adwords alone doesn't appeal to me very much. i could white-label the utility or underlying algorthm and sell it that way, but that's quite a departure from the current approach and would take me straight into b2b territory.<p>thoughts? advice?	2011-04-15 13:04:40 UTC	3	2	1

233570	decision: to continue working on the start-up or go to grad school?	my business partner and i have been plugging away for the past 6 weeks on getting our web start-up going. now he's deciding whether or not to continue on or stop and go to grad school. we're so close to launching and then would need a few 3-6 months to see if it has any potential in the market. we all know paul graham's opinion on going to grad school verses seeing your startup through to completion. i thought some friendly encouragement from the y-combinator crowd might help illuminate his decision. ironically, our "start-up" is a decision making tool, and he has posted a decision page listing all the pros and cons. it's a wiki so anyone can add their two cents. it's still in pre alpha stage but here's a direct link if anyone wants to help steer this sorry fellow from a sad life of grad school at 'cough cough' indiana state university, verses doing what he always deep in his heart wanted to do. (actually, he's always wanted both, hence the conflict, but i digress.) all feedback on this discussion board or on the site is most appreciated.<p>http://decisionero.com/43t_friends/san_francisco_or_indiana%3f<p>cheers!	2008-07-01 21:39:35 UTC	4	11	3

3059296	ask hn: is anyone else unhappy about the recent push for grid interfaces?	with touch screen devices becoming more and more common among electronics, major operating system providers are beginning to really change the user interface, and i'm not sure it's for the better. windows is coming out with metro, a major rework of the desktop interface, and to be honest, i think we can do better.<p>for years, user interfaces were all about data presentation, and efficient use of space. i could open up the start menu and have a few dozen applications displayed in a list, and easily accessible to the eye. but recently, it seems that interfaces are becoming fatter, with a less efficient use for screen space. large buttons are replacing lists, big images are replacing text..  instead of all my apps being in a neat list, my apps will now be on several screens that i have to scroll to. does anyone think that this new interface can have enough pros to outweigh the cons involved in this change? i feel like microsoft is just creating this dramatically new interface to spark curiosity in the consumer's eye, to make the customer believe that microsoft still has a shred of imagination left in the once great company. but to be honest, i feel that microsoft is creating the world's next gimmick. a ditch effort to turn their sales around in a market that they're losing to apple. and i have doubts that this interface is really worth switching to for someone who is competent in the user field? are we on a downhill slope with the efficiency of data presentation? are we catering to being incompetent? i'm not saying the desktop environment shouldn't change, but i really have my doubts that the grid menu system is the best direction. what are your thoughts?<p>i'm sorry if there are spelling errors. i don't have my computer tonight, and i typed this out on my phone ironically. thanks in advance for your thoughts!	2011-10-01 04:10:08 UTC	5	1	0

3627943	how long until a search engine gets sued for discrimination?	i'm sure some crazy case has happened already before, but what i mean is something a little more serious.<p>when there is a position so dominant such as google's or bing/yahoo's, i think it's natural to think that a case of discrimination, if well motivated, could be taken seriously.<p>if there was something that was sort of unifying before was the search result. that depended on what i searched and some algorithm, but it didn't depend on who i was.<p>now things are slightly shifting towards a personal search. google already said that eventually the local search won't be possible to deactivate. in addition to that the search is becoming more and more related to social network results (what your friends searched or commented on) and if facebook will play a role in it i'm sure this will only become more relevant to search results.<p>now, if i live in a specific area and i have specific friends, wouldn't this slow down my search for something different or prevent me from finding something different from what you would expect me to being looking for being a resident of an area and having certain friends?<p>this might seem too abstract but there is actually a million possibilities. it all goes back to the fact that now the search engine won't treat me anymore as anyone else, but it'll guess what i like or want based on my neighborhood and my circle of friends (read: if i lived in a wealthy/safe town my search would be different than if i lived in a poor/higher-crime area).<p>i think the solution could just be to have a couple of "dimmers" on how 'local' or how 'social' i want my search results to be.<p>after all, i don't need any locality or sociality if i'm searching for topics involving food in general, while i might like to have more local/social results if i want to know about what good food i could eat near where i am.<p>this could start from local/social but could be extended to more parameters of the search algorithms. for example, it would be so helpful to get rid of all the forums sometimes or limit my research to the forum in other occasions...<p>isn't it better under all points of view (and it wouldn't even be hard for the users) to allow them to easily choose which parameters are more important to them in a search as opposed to guessing a series of parameters that work for everybody?	2012-02-24 03:48:55 UTC	5	2	4

4734276	ask hn: how do i recruit another programmer for my game?	i've been moonlighting the development of a multiplayer ios game for about 8 months and i find myself in a dilemma. i'm currently working as part of a 2 person team that consists of myself (the main programmer) and an artist. we've fleshed out a lot of the artwork and core mechanics, and you can even play a complete multiplayer game locally. while not public, the game has received very positive feedback from the communities we have shared it with. the problem is that this game was destined to be played with friends over the internet.<p>i know what i need, a programmer familiar with restful web services, aws, client/server architecture and network libraries. getting connected with the right developer has proved to be very challenging however. we even hired a contractor at one point, but were left with less than satisfactory results. we’re hoping to find someone that can eventually be as excited about this project as we are. we’d love to share our enthusiasm and get this game published. i’ve tried a lot of different approaches, but i’m at a loss for where i should look? we’re somewhere between a startup and a serious side project so we’re pretty flexible with the exact business arrangement. any ideas?	2012-11-02 19:18:44 UTC	6	6	1

4682561	fear of making the wrong choice, advice needed	hello everyone. i'll try to keep it short. after deciding to learn programming i picked python because of the online programming classes that are available for free and because i want to start with web development.<p>the problem started last week in a different programming community where someone mentioned that there might not be enough job opportunities for beginners and that it's better to invest my time to php or c# instead.<p>i'll skip that this comment was accepted with positivity to a community which is strictly made to help beginners to learn programming but, he genuinely made me think: is it a way that this will end bad? is there a possibility that after reading and learning for huge amount of hours daily that i won't be able to offer my service to add value to a company or customers?<p>what makes this decision heavier is my perception that i'm not young enough to afford to make a wrong choice (i'm 30 years old) and i'm not from u.s. (which i might say the job market for python and ruby developers looks bigger). to add to that even more, i'm not planning to stay in my country but i'll most definitely stay in europe.<p>to sum it all up, should i consider the search results from monster and other career websites, coupled with the mentioned advice given to me (and, in effect, many beginners who read that forum) as good measurement of a programming language's job prospects or is there some kind of flawed perception involved?	2012-10-22 10:53:24 UTC	7	10	0

it seems having your startup featured on large website is a great way to boost your chances of success, and as i am soon to launch my own startup i'm really interested in hearing any tips or advise you can offer.	2
is it a good idea to offer some kind of promotion? e.g. 10 beta keys for the readers? or does that kind of strategy take away from your pitch?	2011-09-20 20:29:00 UTC	12	3	3

4191501	re-thinking music with ziibra	hey hn,<p>i've been working on this project with a kick-ass team for the past 8 months, and we finally launched it last week.<p>ziibra helps up-and-coming artists make music their full time job. using our music, the more fans that pledge to purchase an album the cheaper a project becomes because the price is driven down through their social network outreach. cheaper price = happy fans. plus, the artists benefit too. by pre-selling a new album, artists get fan reach, cash flow to fund the project, and a marketing platform to cross-promote their new work!<p>i was hoping to get some feedback back from the community, and see what the general reaction is.<p>cheers,<p>omri	2012-07-02 22:59:05 UTC	13	16	0

6142978	should i go to college or keep working in silicon valley?	i&#x27;m working at a startup as a rails developer. i was hired straight out of high school, which meant being underpaid, though i&#x27;ve spent my time improving my skills. long story short, the job market in silicon valley is really hot - i now have 2 outside offers in the $110-120k range (0-0.5% equity) at early to late-stage startups, and i might be able to bid the offers up to the 130k+ range. at the same time, i&#x27;m thinking about going back to college - a non-ivy but top cs school (think carnegie mellon, uc berkeley, uiuc).<p>one thought i have is that we&#x27;re possibly at the high point of the current tech boom and that i should take a job while the market is hot, then go back to school when there&#x27;s a cooldown. there&#x27;s also the fact that as a fresh cs grad, 4 years down the line, i would be making roughly the same, or maybe just slightly more, as i could make right now (100-120k).<p>but i wonder whether going back to school after being in the industry for 2-3 years will even make sense.<p>ultimately, i don&#x27;t know how to weigh the social and educational experience of college against starting my career 4 years early. i&#x27;m not particularly concerned that a lack of a degree itself will hold me back in the future. any thoughts?<p>update: no college debt, parents thankfully have enough to pay for it.	2013-08-01 19:47:39 UTC	14	27	3

2262527	i'm a cargo cult programmer, help me	hello hn i come to you for help.<p>i went to college and got an information systems degree, it was a crappy college so the most programming we had was dabbling with arrays and pointers in c, not much algorithsms &#38; data structures, no unix, no operating systems and no compilers, and most importantly no problem solving. half way through college my father died so i had to find a job to make ends meet,  somehow i got sucked  into the java "enterprise" world where i've been for the past 5 years, glueing api's and frameworks together, with some javascript and sql on the side, however on the verge of my 30's, i now have found that i lack the fundamentals of computer science,  the things every programmer should know: algo's, data structures, operating systems an understanding of compilers and being profficient with linux. eventually i plan on going back to a real university and getting a cs degree, but i'm unable to do so at the moment, this is why i have come to ask for help.<p>otoh i have given thought about if programming is really for me, i have found that i'm really, really bad at problem solving and "thinking outside of the box" i have come to accept that i'm really not smart. i'm slow, forgetfull, concepts never seem to stick, i have to force myself to not take things for granted, it seems no matter how hard i try i can't look at problems from different perspectives and understand the  implications of a particular solution, i'm starting to think i may have a learning dissability, or that is because i lack the basic toolkit for problem solving, but i really think i'm just not very smart.<p>of course the realization of my lack of skills, as you may have guessed, is because i want a better job, and there seems to be no place in the world for dumb programmers, and to be honest this is something i understand given my limitations and looking at my other peers, seeing how long it takes for me when programming something or understanding a problem, seeing how fast other people can grasp concepts that i struggle with, i understand that i'm just not valuable that all my experience	3
means nothing, so i'm back to 0.<p>i have started going through the basic algo's and data structures again with a basic java book about algorithms (i tried cormen but no way i could wrap my head around that stuff, i forgot all the calculus/math from college and i just lack the mathematical maturity for that book).<p>i'm also trying to study discrete maths, operating systems and compilers, of course one step at a time. i imagine this will take me years just to get a basic understanding of all these concepts.<p>and finally trying to memorise all those linux commands i always forget.<p>lastly i'm trying to learn technologies and languages that will help me get a better job, i'm still not decided whether i should learn ruby on rails or python or lisp or just stick to java and learn android and do my own thing  and forget about joining a "cool" startup or working at the big guys like google(10 years from now after i become a real programmer of course...) or quitting programming altogether.<p>hackers, i understand this is a long and boring post, filled with grammar &#38; spelling errors (english is not my primary language), but i only ask of you to guide me whether i should continue this path in which i have invested all my adult life on or just start again from zero, i just don't want to be a cargo cult programmer anymore.<p>thank you	2011-02-25 15:54:04 UTC	202	158	0

it is very important for athletes to do this kind of visualization work, in a form appropriate to their discipline, but often when we are caught up in the intense routine of training and competition, it feels like we have no time for the internal stuff. i know this quite well. sometimes when i am in the heat of tournament preparation, months will pass with brutal sparring, constant pain, hitting the mats hundreds of times a night while drilling throws, and then i’ll realize that i’ve moved a bit away from what really makes things tick. then i’ll spend a week doing soft, quiet work on timing, perception, reading and controlling my opponent’s breath patterns and internal blinks, subtle unbalancing touches that set up the dramatic throws that ultimately steal the spotlight. after these periods of reflection, i’ll almost invariably have a leap in ability because my new physical skills are supercharged by becoming integrated into my mental framework.	0
the importance of undulating between external and internal (or concrete and abstract; technical and intuitive) training applies to all disciplines, and unfortunately the internal tends to be neglected. most intelligent nfl players, for example, use the off-season to look at their schemes more abstractly, study tapes, break down aerial views of the field, notice offensive and defensive patterns. then, during the season they sometimes fall into tunnel vision, because the routine of constant pain requires every last bit of reserves. i have heard quite a few nfl quarterbacks who had minor injuries and were forced to sit out a game or two, speak of the injury as a valuable opportunity to concentrate on the mental side of their games. when they return, they play at a higher level. in all athletic disciplines, it is the internal work that makes the physical mat time click, but it is easy to lose touch with this reality in the middle of the grind.<p>"""""<p>the idea suggested above is very intriguing, but begs the question what are the internal and external training components when applied to a software programmer/engineer?	2012-12-11 06:26:55 UTC	1	1	1

1. why are there no offerings for ec2 type services by rackspace, amazon etc in india ? there are few datacenter services like netmagic and ctrl-s which do not have the option of api calls. you cannot believe the interfaces and no easy way to evaluate a service.<p>2. the vps server (i did not research dedicated servers) costs are significantly higher than a similar vps server say, rackspace or linode or even mediatemple. compare mediatemple and linode, there is less significant difference in value of the servers based on the configuration offered. is it purely business that drives these costs ?	2013-03-14 18:16:10 UTC	1	1	3

4823585	ask hn: how do i inspire college/high-school students to work with me?	good afternoon and happy holidays hacker news,	3
im from a very low economic &#38; technology skill level community in nc and i want that to change.<p>i've acquired different funding for projects in order for students to work with me and therefore bring technology skills and money to the community, but nobody is interested.<p>like why is that the case? especially when presently many people don't have jobs.<p>i know many of them are in debt and many of them are at a poor level in technology, but no one is interested. but what is so funny is that these are the same people that complain about how our government is unfair to them and how they've been given a bad hand.<p>i would think that, they would be more interested.<p>back then when i was in college, if somebody had offered me a work/job where i can gain money and experience (in a field im interested in), i would've jumped at the opportunity.<p>am i targeting wrong students? is it a mental or psychological issue? or am i the problem?	2012-11-23 20:39:31 UTC	1	4	1

5021215	ask hn: is this a good scenario to use node.js?	a couple of my friends and me are planning to make a time tracking web application. between us we have experience in java, c++, django and backbone.js, though we have never made any full fledged commercial application. this is our first real project and we wanted a bit more clarity before learning nodejs.<p>more about the app:<p>users will use this application through out the day to log various tasks (sort of like a task management application)	2
,track the time spent on these tasks (time tracking).	0
users do not interact with each other's tasks.we expect users to use this app continuously throughout the day.<p>so we want the app to have high performance. we also foresee making native mobile applications (ios &#38; android) in the future, which can work with the same api used for the web. json and javascript are very appealing due to this. we also don't want to re-write code on the client and server.<p>i have already checked out this answer: how to decide when to use nodejs? but would really like some more clarity.<p>is node.js a good fit for this scenario? what advantages would it have over, say django+backbone.js?<p>also at so: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14197870/is-this-a-good-scenario-for-using-nodejs/14198179	2013-01-07 14:59:32 UTC	2	1	4

2075785	why not just create a user curated search engine?	i've been reading a lot of the google-related search engine complaints. who hasn't? they're everywhere for whatever reason. a common theme that i seem to see in most of them is that people seem to agree that some sort of user interaction is one of the few ways to eliminate spam and seo content farm results.<p>so, why not just create a user curated search engine? web pages would be indexed. users would filter them, using queries. on a per-query basis, indexed pages would be subject to a reddit-esque voting system for relevance to that query. there would be no visible up voting, though. there would only be a visible down vote option. up voting would be done automatically when a user clicks a result. down voting would be done if a user visits a page and the page is not relevant to the query, so they come back to the search results and down vote the result (it would remove the automated up vote + 1 more to net a subtraction). pages indexed more recently would be given priority over older pages. so what would eventually happen is the most viewed and newest pages for a query would bubble to the top, and older posts would be in the middle, and down rated posts would be at the end or maybe even excluded all together.<p>obviously there are holes in this, such as people scamming the up-vote clicking mechanisms but i'm sure that could be prevented with more thought.<p>i think the key is that all of this voting is done on a per query basis, for relevance to that query.	2011-01-06 16:07:13 UTC	2	4	1

my grammer isn't that good, keep that in mind while you read.<p>i work in a php (a language i despise) devshop as the lead developer (i only have 1 year experience in programming), we build cms powered websites.	2
i started working in this company a few months ago, before that i worked at 2 other similiar companies.<p>the main thing i hate is the workflow, for example here is how we build a website:<p><pre><code>  * a design is sent to me by mail.	2
* i go to a website we've already built and download it's source	3
* i clean the source folders (images etc..)	2
* i go to a website we've already built and export the database tables	2
* i clean them.	2
* i build it.	2
* i upload it with ftp.	4
* test using the refresh button :o	4
* done.	0
</code></pre>	2
at no point unit testing is used (my boss says it's a waste of time).	2
we don't use revision control tools (my boss says no one uses it).	1
we don't use tools to automate stuff (deployment etc..).<p>when i suggest to my boss to use those stuff, he comes back "i have more than 5 years of experience you have 1".	0
my boss isn't a developer, he thinks firefox was built by google and "ietester is better than ie9 so use it".<p>all of our websites have stuff like this in the code:	3
`mysql_query('select * from foo where id = ' . $_get['id'])`.	0
some of our websites have no password verification on the admin panel.<p>keep in mind that i have seen those stuff in all 3 companies i worked in, this is awful.<p>hn'ers should i quit and start my own company ?	2013-02-04 17:43:15 UTC	2	4	3

990593	ask hn:how to promote a linux live cd?	grml is a linux live system targeted to sysadmins and console users &#60;http://grml.org&#62;. unique selling points are for example good and powerful zsh configuration, tips and tricks with grml-tips, flexible boot process (e.g. start ssh server on request, download and execute a script from a remote system), persistency features, grml-terminalserver for easy network boot, grml2usb for easy usb boot, and many more.<p>even though grml's default language is english, unfortunately it is mostly known and featured in german-speaking countries (as it is an austrian distribution).<p>any hints to promote grml to non-german speaking countries?	3

1535830	ask hn: are you tired of google reader?	currently google reader is the main app that most use to read rss, but it doesn't really handle reading other sources such as articles that you come across online. for those, there's instapaper and read it later to name a few.<p>i was wondering is there room for innovation in reading apps. i think it's safe to say that people read a lot more (specially online) these days than ever before. in addition, i don't think the amount of reading is going to decrease in coming years.<p>do you think there's a market for a better reader app or google has already won the war? in addition, will you pay for a better reader app? if so, how much and what features you would like to see?<p>thanks!	2010-07-21 17:23:42 UTC	3	3	4

3664567	ask pg: thought's on google's "don't be evil" mantra	i came across your startup school talk from 2008(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7k0vrukxkc).<p>in the talk, you mention how companies that always (appear to) work for the net benefit of the customer do well, the two main examples being google and the early stages of microsoft.<p>in the recent turn of events with google's new unified search policy (and their quest to make more money with ad-targeting that is not only accurate(read more expensive), but also very creepy), do you believe that google's elixir of youth has now run dry and they are in the process of becoming like microsoft and ibm? will their bullying continue?<p>the same could be said for facebook. in the beginning it appeared that facebook was providing a social network with a clean ui, in addition to being a safer alternative to the sex-offender-infested myspace. facebook has adopted the "bullying" mantra with every new product feature, e.g. news feed, ticker, and timeline. moreover, many feel very insecure with all of their information being in zuckerberg's control. though, to be fair, they voluntarily gave that information up by signing the tos.<p>do you feel that google and facebook are now "over the hill", have matured, and in the coming years will no longer be as relevant? these giants may stand, but have their actions sown the seeds for new startups to takeover this space?	2012-03-04 23:29:12 UTC	5	0	0

4220106	ask hn:  pure client-side padmapper would be legal and easy, yeah?	padmapper's new workaround based on 3taps is being hotly debated today:  http://blog.padmapper.com/2012/07/09/bringing-craigslist-back/.  3taps claims that craigslist listings are in the public domain.  whether or not you agree, padmapper is in essence escaping craigslist's lawyers simply by hiding behind 3taps. but let me get to my questions.<p>padmapper is really just an alternative view of craigslist data. i don't see any functionality that couldn't be implemented purely on the client side, using for example javascript executed as an extension or a bookmarklet. this client-side code would execute craigslist searches, scrape the results, and render in the form that padmapper does today.  while the tos can disallow other businesses from such scraping and re-publication, i can't see how craigslist has any legal standing to disallow users from doing that for themselves (in which case it's personal use, not re-publication), whether they do so manually by jotting down listings on a notepad or automatically by running a script on their computer.<p>can anyone give solid arguments against what i am suggesting?	2012-07-09 20:03:30 UTC	7	10	2
1481393	a device for twitter for the developing world...	i've started a new project and i would like to get the hn community's thoughts.<p>i'm creating a device for using twitter that:<p>1) is totally self-contained,	2
2) uses solar / hand crank power, and	0
3) uses satellites for connectivity (so it can be used anywhere on earth).<p>the device will take different form factors, i.e. one version will be a tablet, one will be a large, free standing unit that a crowd could congregate around, etc.<p>i'm going to give these devices to people who live in the developing world, and who do not have access to twitter, the internet, or to the "global conversation."<p>my intent is to circumvent poverty, lack of technical infrastructure, and government control by giving anyone, anywhere, the ability to communicate on twitter.<p>this is a not-for-profit project (it's going to be based out of a large university in chicago).<p>i'm hoping that people will use the device for social, political, and practical, bi-directional communication.<p>the devices will run a custom twitter client with normal client functionality.<p>however, we will also route (and translate) all applicable messages to communities of people who have agreed to help with the project, i.e. farming questions in africa will be routed to a collection of farmers and agriculture phd's; political issues will be sent to a collection of people at the united nations, etc.<p>the basic idea is to open lines of communication into societies where there are none, and in doing so, increase cultural understanding and encourage peace.<p>thoughts?<p>thanks,	0

4399678	ask hn: what do you like about the hacker news community?	apropos of the usual angst about whether or not hacker news is degrading as a community, i thought i would emphasize the positive by asking what you like about the community that brought you here in the first place and has kept you here till now.<p>i was brought here by reading paul graham's essays on his personal website. way back in 2003, a local friend recommended that all of the parents in my homeschooling support group read pg's essay "why nerds are unpopular." she seemed to know of pg's name from his contributions to the internet research community (of which she was part), but i had never heard of him. i read and thought about the essay, and in 2005 a friend recommended that i read "what you'll wish you'd known," which i have since recommended to each of my children as they approach high school age, and have often recommended to friends. as i heard about more paul graham essays, i learned to browse around his personal site and at some point followed a link to "news," which links here. at first i only lurked on what was then called startup news, but by november 2008 i had an account here, which has become quite active. i was drawn here by paul's interest in education policy, a passionate interest of mine since 1972, but i have found other interesting topics to discuss here.<p>what brought you here? what do you like about hacker news?	2012-08-18 00:43:36 UTC	22	11	1

i would like to introduce you a website i launched recently. it&#x27;s a &quot;social&quot; for sharing or selling recipes, this is the link: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;nyum.social&#x2f;	0
this is not a unique and the best site from a certain point of view, but is different.	4
with different i mean it&#x27;s designed to facilitate the user interaction and needs. when a  person needs to look for a recipe generally googles it and arrives somewhere to compare 2 or 3 recipes, basing on the ingredients of each recipe and the diet the person is following, this ends with 1 recipe. again googling the recipe nutrients facts the user discover that this recipe is not suitable for him, maybe because of calories or missing ingredient or whatever. at the end the user will try to look for another recipe, maybe this time by specifying the ingredients on some sites that permit it.	4
another case is the person with a certain disease or nutrients facts needs, for him is almost impossible to find easily the right recipe.	0
what we did in this site is implementing all this needs, rendering easy and funny in someway the interaction between web and not &quot;master&quot; users.	2015-03-28 16:11:23 UTC	1	0	2

9464896	ask hn: help me learn everything about mobile marketing	hello guys,	2
so here is the deal: i built an app, it&#x27;s starting to work quite well. i&#x27;m monetizing pretty well. the thing is, all the traffic i&#x27;ve got is organic.<p>i would like to know everything there is to know on how to get traffic&#x2f;market my app. i understand it&#x27;s a broad subject, but i want to become a master in user acquisition. basically i want to grow my user base to the millions.<p>can someone point me in the right direction? either there&#x27;s something i&#x27;m missing, but it seems that the whole point is just to have a cpi &lt; ltv, once you&#x27;re there you just have to inject money. does it get more complicated than that?<p>if you have any website&#x2f;book&#x2f;blog recommendations i&#x27;d be very happy to have them. i&#x27;m an engineer so i&#x27;m probably lacking the fundamentals, any &quot;reference&quot; marketing book still valid at this moment is very welcome.	3
cheers!<p>another way to rephrase my question would be: what do the marketing&#x2f;user acquisition managers actually do in startups that have a mobile products (game companies for instance)?	2015-04-30 13:29:54 UTC	1	0	2

7461230	how do you implement stateless auth in nodejs?	so i&#x27;m making a mobile app, which will use the api i&#x27;m writing. the api will be used only by the mobile app, and not by anyone else (maybe i&#x27;ll allow others with a limited method set?).<p>the api itself, works except i&#x27;m concerned about:	2
- security	0
- it being stateless<p>i&#x27;m using passport.js for user authentication, and a redisstore for storing user sessions:<p><pre><code>    app.use(express.cookieparser());	0
app.use(express.session({	0
secret: secrets.sessionsecret,	0
store: new redisstore({ host: &#x27;localhost&#x27;, port: 6379 })	3
}));	4
</code></pre>	2
for api calls that require an authenticated user, i just check if the `req.isauthenticated()` method is true or not. pretty standard.<p>however, my reading and research suggests that api&#x27;s that reply on sessions are poor design. how do i change that? what is a good, not complicated design for this kind of a model? what should i be doing given my use case? any code samples?	2014-03-24 20:32:33 UTC	1	0	1

10013436	ask hn: us citizens, do you use an offshore account?	i realize this might be a strange question for hn but i also think there are a lot of intelligent people here who typically make pretty good money so i thought i&#x27;d throw it out there.<p>i&#x27;ve been researching opening up an offshore account as a way of breaking the &quot;all of your eggs in one basket&quot; situation a lot of us are currently in. after seeing what happened in greece and getting a better understanding of just what our financial situation is as a country i would like to start putting some money away into an offshore account, possibly in a country that might be a retirement location. i am not looking to evade the irs or hide money away, i just want to remove my current single point of failure if you will :)	0
in researching this topic it seems as if this has become quite difficult in recent years due to some regulations put in place making it less than beneficial for other countries to open up accounts for us citizens.<p>so my question is: if you are a us citizen with an offshore account, have you had any issues with it? if so, has it been worth the trouble? was it a hassle to setup (using a 3rd party, large initial deposit, etc)? any alternatives outside of &quot;hard goods&quot; like silver or gold?<p>it seems most sites out on the web that discuss this topic want to sell you an e-book or a website subscription so any real-world experience would be great. and yes, i get that this is a great question for a financial advisor...	2015-08-05 22:53:17 UTC	1	0	1

4111691	remind hn: please submit original articles and titles and canonical urls	some recent threads here on hn reminded me to review the hacker news guidelines linked to from the bottom of the main page and other pages here. there are two guidelines that are good reminders of how to resolve some of the issues that have received meta-discussion here. let's discuss the guidelines and how to apply them. the headings i've written below emphasize practices that i think are helpful:<p>1. prefer original, journalistic titles<p>"in submissions<p>"please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase or exclamation points, or adding a parenthetical remark saying how great an article is. it's implicit in submitting something that you think it's important."<p>a few paragraphs below that, the guidelines say, "you can make up a new title if you want, but if you put gratuitous editorial spin on it, the editors may rewrite it."<p>one user benefit of original titles is remembering which articles have already been submitted, perhaps with no discussion (the most frequent case for any new submission) or perhaps with much discussion and placement on the front page of hn just yesterday. another user benefit of original titles on new submissions is that other things being equal, most titles devised by journalists actually grab attention better (and with less spin on the discussion) than most titles made up by hn participants. new submissions on the hacker news new page are now so frequent that any article is at risk of being missed, no matter how good it is, but i've seen really, really, really good new articles fail to gain the discussion i think they deserve mostly because they are submitted with a modified title, obscuring what they are about or making the articles sound more dull than the original title did. (some good articles have an article title that heads the article and a cross-reference title used from the publication main page, and sometimes the cross-reference titles are better than the main article titles at briefly describing the article. we all get to try to use our best judgment when given a choice of titles.)<p>2. prefer original sources with canonical urls<p>the hacker news guidelines say "please submit the original source. if a blog post reports on something they found on another site, submit the latter." blogspam is highly disfavored here on hn, as i have observed repeatedly in comments after 1305 days here. everyone prefers submissions of sources that actually do some fact-checking and research before writing, rather than just copying other people's writing. in particular, sciencedaily and physorg are not original sources and are often not reliable sources. there is a better source for any article you find in either sciencedaily or physorg, and many hacker news readers have learned to disregard articles from either of those press release digest companies.<p>a trickier issue is what url to submit from sources that give articles multiple urls. for a while the online site of the economist (a very good source appreciated by a lot of hn readers) was quite inconsistent in how it assigned urls to articles, giving many articles two or three different urls depending on how they were linked internally on the site. other sites distinguish print versions of articles or mobile-viewable versions of articles from the main view of an article with different urls. i've seen a lot of discussion of preferred urls of articles here on hn over the years. the suggestion i pick up from other users here is to prefer the "canonical url" (a web search for that exact phrase will find sources to explain that concept) for each and every article submitted here. hacker news runs an automated detector of duplicate submissions that works best (upvoting the first submission of an article when a duplicate comes in) if articles are submitted with their canonical urls. if you read the article first in a news aggregator (e.g., google news) or in an rss feed or as a link out on someone's blog, as you submit the url, chop off the extra characters at the end that reveal the source of the link. some readers like to read mobile versions of articles, and some readers like to read print versions of articles, and some readers like to read one-page versions of articles. the canonical url from many of the better sites on the web should either autodetect a reader's web client or format to a preestablished user preference. the other urls may be what you like, but they have unpredictable behavior when submitted to hn and read on many other user's devices--with an especially annoying behavior being starting a print job as soon as the page is accessed. just submit the canonical url, and let the user decide what to do from there.<p>similarly, just submit a good new article, and let users decide from there what to do about it. a lot of good new articles get ignored. no one has time to read all of them. hn users decide for themselves what to read. if some good article was submitted a few days ago, and no one noticed it, take the site title "hacker news" as a suggestion to look for something new, something from today's news, and try submitting that for the discussion it deserves. there are always plenty of new articles to read. (in the occasional case of resubmitting a "classic" article on a recurrent issue that has come up again in hn discussion, which is apparently allowed by the duplicate detector eventually lapsing after a set time, then please include the article date as a parenthical comment on the title, e.g. "how to disagree" (march 2008).)<p>following the habits of other hn users who began here even earlier than i did, if i see a duplicate submission that escaped the duplicate detector (usually because one submission or the other wasn't a submission of the canonical url), i try to note the earlier submission, with a link, in a comment on the later submission(s). in such cases, i am not expressing any opinion about what other hn readers should do about the observation that the link has been submitted twice (or more). i just note that so that people like me who wonder "haven't i seen that before?" can get a reality check on what they remember. where (and whether, and how) people decide to discuss articles is up to each reader here. over the years, i've appreciated comments like that from the previous users who have that habit, so i upvote their comments and have begun emulating them. i don't think the previous users who have that habit mean any offense by that, and i certainly don't.<p>i'd appreciate comments here from other hn readers about what submission practices are most helpful to the community (even if you disagree with me). best wishes for a great reading and discussion experience here.	2012-06-14 15:17:45 UTC	1	1	1

4054722	ask hn: journals for cs practitioners?	does anybody know of any journals that cater to practitioners in computer science, rather than academics? i think journal articles are a great way to introduce novel ideas or discuss clever implementations. practitioner-oriented articles were pretty common back in the 1980's, but seem to have all but disappeared today. that's sad, because there are a lot of cool ideas that don't necessarily break new ground in theoretical cs but are still interesting to practitioners. e.g. joel bartlett at dec published a really great paper on conservative garbage collection in the late 1980's, complete with sample code, that formed the basis of numerous implementations, including the collectors in sbcl and dalvik. articles like that are few and far between these days.<p>i think there is a nice middle ground between informal blog posts and theoretical cs papers, and i'd love it if hn-ers could point me to something that fills that gap.	2012-06-01 17:59:23 UTC	2	0	4

6009520	nxt rdr - uncluttered online feed reader.	hello ppl,<p>i&#x27;m just writing to let you know that i&#x27;m making an open and public beta of an online rss reader app i made for myself, but as it grows i think i could share it with the community. the main idea behind this work is to make a clean, uncluttered yet easy to use feed reader. as i don&#x27;t like all that &quot;share with this, share on that&quot; stuff, all i needed was an app that centers its content on the feeds and nothing but the feeds. thats why i dislike apps like feedly, flipboard and such. i&#x27;m not saying those are bad feeds apps, its just i find those apps so overloaded with functions i never use and decide to make one by myself.	3
this was a summer project, and i think if i find this app useful to read feeds maybe someone else could also find it useful too. :-)	3
you can register an account, go to feeds and start adding your feeds url in the input box. import opml is a work in progress.	1
you can use w to go backwards in the list and s to go forward. i will be adding more keybindings to make navegation a breeze.	1
the site is responsive, so you can visit an expect some decent navigation with your smartphone as well.	1
the feeds sources auto updates every 10 minutes.<p>let me know your comments or suggestion if you wish to: templar.dev@gmail.com<p>the feed reader url: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;nxtrdr.dyndns.info<p>best regards.	2013-07-08 21:40:24 UTC	2	0	2

2007375	discuss my idea: how about a more generic version of posterous?	i've been thinking about this idea over the past few days. i've even already written code for it and have a functional prototype. but, everyone i tell the idea to doesn't seem to grasp the concept or just can't see why it would be useful. i was even told that i "could achieve more" by looking for new ideas, lol.<p>my idea is simple and came to me in a simple manner. the idea is this - a hosted database service (a la mongohq) with an easy and highly accessible crud interface via smtp (a la posterous).<p>the idea came to me while thinking about writing my own smtp-based blog, like posterous. i wanted to write my own blog that i was able to write to using any email client i had, instead of using some annoying wysiwyg editor. i'd just use markdown for formatting. but then a friend suggested, "why not generalize it for more than just blogs"? i'm not sure to what extent he meant, but i immediately envisioned something similar to posterous but much much more generalized. basically, a database that anyone could perform crud on using their email client.<p>why email? everyone has it. it's easily accessible. it doesn't take much explanation. there are email client implementations in pretty much every environment you can think of.<p>it obviously wouldn't be for heavy read/write traffic database applications, but more for casual users that don't fully understand the internal workings of how to use their own database. it could perhaps be used by myself to write my own posterous-esque blogging platform. it could be used for email storage and backup. it could be use for file sharing, backing up files with associated meta data. a simple api could provide non-smtp read access to your data - perhaps rest.<p>i feel like this idea excites me because of two reasons, a) it has a clear cut hosting-based business plan and b) i don't even know if i fully know how this is entirely useful or what the applications of it could be. i haven't gotten very good feedback on it, though. so, to exercise some of what i've read about lean startups and just throwing your ideas out there, i figure i'll see what you guys think about this?<p>here is what i have running for it so far. it's just something i wrote in a single afternoon as kind of a proof of concept for myself. i wrote a simple smtp server that does nothing but handling incoming emails and performs some simple, crude authentication on them. authentication is done by signing up on the site, downloading the provided "db.auth" file. to submit data to the database, address an email to "db@collabreate.co" and attach the "db.auth" file. the records will appear on the website. there is no other functionality in this demo.<p>http://collabreate.co:8080/records/<p>you have to include the /records/ otherwise it won't load anything. it's port 8080 because it's running on my home fios connection. the domain is just something i use to play with - it's not related to this particular idea.<p>so, what do you all think? :p	2010-12-15 07:36:54 UTC	2	3	1

2135116	ux/ui guy + business guy, looking for technical co-founder	i realize it's a bit audacious to post what is essentially a 'job listing' on hn, but my partner and i really think we have a great opportunity to offer. (right, right… doesn't everyone?)<p>//about us:	1
we're two guys creating a rich internet application to streamline online collaboration. the need for this product is something we both recognized independently, while working in two completely dissimilar industries. we did our research, identified several shortcomings prevalent in existing products, and developed a unique application to address these issues. i come from a background in web development and graphic design, so i'm handling the ux/ui. my partner started and expanded multiple social initiatives as a teenager and currently works in finance; he's handling the business end.<p>we've made great progress, but we're clearly missing 1/3 of the team without our technical co-founder. we want to get this person on board immediately so they can help shape the product from the beginning. equity will be split evenly between the 3 of us, assuming we all get along during a short trial period and decide to work together permanently.<p>//our progress:	1
we've taken care of all the major up-front research; competitive analysis, market research, tentative financial projections, and so on. thanks to my partner, we've already been speaking regularly with several potential investors, including one who is the managing general partner of a $150+ million early stage venture capital firm.<p>on the technical front, we've done a fair amount of research on different ria frameworks/toolkits. we're not sold on any particular one, but would instead like our technical co-founder to take the lead and make the final decision. so this person will have direct influence on the product right out of the gate.<p>//we have:	2
1) a comprehensive business plan. it's been strengthened with feedback from several entrepreneur friends. a couple of investors are looking it over now.	3
2) detailed mockups. we've shown them to several groups of people and iterated based on feedback.	0
3) detailed notes on app functionality/flow. we're also working on a more formal functional spec doc, but want our tech co-founder to help with that.<p>//what our tech co-founder should have:	2
1) genuine interest in online collaboration	1
2) ambition; the desire to work on an original idea that isn't just a copycat product with a minor twist	3
3) adaptability and an open mind	0
4) the ability to articulate technical concepts and lead/instruct others	1
5) desire to actively contribute to a project, not just write code<p>if this piques your interest, we'd love to chat. we're based in nyc, so we can do coffee if you're in the area, or skype/phone if you're not. we're open to having someone work remotely, but we're more than happy to assist in relocation to nyc if that interests you.<p>//tl;dr:	4
we're two guys who work really well together and bring complimentary skills to the table. we have a unique product idea, connections to investors, and we're looking for a talented tech co-founder eager to work on an innovative product.<p>please feel free to express interest here or send an email to hi@kalude.com.	0
if you email, we would appreciate the inclusion of links to previous work (or your github account, or something…) so we have a frame of reference when getting back to you. we have no idea what kind of response to expect from this, if any, but we'll do our best to get back to everyone.<p>//a little more about us:	2
i'm a project manager at a digital marketing agency. it's a very small group, so i've had plenty of experience getting my hands dirty in various areas. i've tinkered with open source content management systems, done a little bit of database work, created countless wireframes and workflow mockups, and so on. additionally, i've been developing websites since age 12, so i have about 15 years of front end coding experience. i possess enough technical knowledge to hold my own in a conversation about technical minutiae, so if we need to have real a discussion about latency issues due to scaling, i won't just stare and ask if we should 'get more bandwidths'. my responsibilities include:	0
1) the ux and ui (in our product, these are atypically major components)	0
2) project management	3
3) marketing	0
4) front-end coding (when i can be of use)<p>my partner is handling the business side. he has a history of starting and expanding global social initiatives, including a program sponsored by the un, reuters, sony, and the iucn. he currently works for the corporate strategy group of a major financial institution and has great connections through his university's alumni network. my partner's responsibilities include:	2
1) the legal, business, and sales stuff	4
2) securing funds	1
3) bringing in-depth knowledge of the enterprise market and the online collaboration needs of bigger businesses	2
4) handling the day-to-day business operations (once we really get going)<p>my partner and i work well together and this is a project we both care a lot about. we're looking for someone who is equally passionate and able to handle a serious debate about some random product feature-- then crack a joke and get along just fine afterward. we also like to goof around and tend to be pretty sarcastic, so someone with a similar temperament would be great (though it's not required).	2011-01-24 13:39:14 UTC	3	0	0

1999729	ask hn: how do gmail/facebook serve good context sensitive ads?	i figured that since a lot of people responsible for these systems read hn regularly, and i haven't got any satisfactory replies on stackoverflow, so i should ask this here.<p>gmail serves some really good ads on the column on the right of the email text. same goes for facebook. the ads which i see on facebook are often (very) relevant to what interests me. obviously they preprocess the information available to them. they have a lot of user specific information available to them. so i would imagine they preprocess all of it, before generating any ad recommendations.<p>does anyone know of what specific algorithms/technique do those systems use? thanks.	2010-12-13 07:33:35 UTC	3	2	1

1786919	ask hn: web app for non-web savvy audience	going along with the general consensus of those "i'm working on a super-secret-confidential-double-dodeca-awesome project and i can't give anything away" lines, i have a question for you hners.  this isn't a throwaway, this is my account.  mind you, i hardly post, but believe me, i browse.  i browse like a badass.<p>i'm working on a tracking tool and social network for a very (very) specific niche market.  it's not particularly small, but it's a market that isn't intimately familiar with the concepts of web 2.0.  i'd wager most of them still use antiquated versions of ie.  that being said, most of them are involved in forums of some sort or another.  in fact, what i'm trying to do is centralize and standardize what they do in some of these forums.  i'm unsure how my notoriously stubborn audience will adapt from phpbb to my proprietary tool.<p>the purpose of this project?  well, i'm part of this community (not the web-illiterate part).  i wanted to build something for myself (started in excel, years ago, ugh).  after speaking with a bunch of people also involved, it seems that virtually everyone i spoke to is enthusiastic about my idea.  i've gotten a group of beta testers that i define in a range of browsing skills to see how my program works.  it's an interesting challenge, building a web app for people that barely understand the concept, let alone the definition.  i've never built a site this large all by my lonesome, so i'm excited to see how i manage, from conception to production without a cofounder or team.  this is more of a portfolio builder that i scrape a few hours a week together to work on than a business venture, but it wouldn't be terrible to earn a little advertising revenue.<p>have any of you dealt with a large, decentralized, and non web-savvy audience before?  if so, any advice?<p>edit: from my comments, revorad broke me down and got me to spill the beans on my project.  it didn't take long.  i would make a terrible spy.  here's the project info, in a little more detail.<p>it's a target score tracking tool for gun owners, built around aggregating scores, ammunition makes/types, individual gun scores, etc to let individuals track how well they do (in general, with one of their guns, etc) and track performance metrics across the user base to determine which ammo works well, which guns perform best, etc.<p>so, a tracking tool mixed with a social network. i guess.	2
it started as something to help me track my scores and see how i progressed. i made a score calculating algorithm just using excel that factored in ring size, distance, wind, and a whole load of other factors and it worked really well. i had one of those "this is madness" moments and started porting it into a cakephp app.<p>there are a ton of ajax page interactions, ui/ux elements, etc that are very different from what traditional message boards and forums use.	2010-10-13 13:00:00 UTC	3	13	1

152946	ask yc: what income-generating systems do you employ?	i remember reading a steve pavlina article a few years back about income. his claim was that it's better to diversify your income in the sense of decentralization. that's why a salary could be a lot more risky than self-employment. if you set up a bunch of automated systems that generate you a $100/month, then a single system failure will only put you out of that $100; on the other hand, if you put all your eggs in one basket, you bankrupt if anything happens. the idea is that once you set up enough of these systems, you can essentially spend only a few hours each week or month tuning them, but otherwise sit back and let them generate income in the background.<p>pavlina's example was his game website. he created a site (company) that sold games, and once he optimized his site to be easily found on google and automatically process transactions by letting users download the game after payment, he could essentially put it on cruise control and let the income flow (and all the games would themselves be little "systems"--if one game was made obsolete by a much better competitor, he would not lose all his income).<p>i am curious as to examples of such income generating systems. several blatantly obvious ones come to mind: ecommerce (what pavlina did), writing a book/song/etc. and collecting the royalties, taking a tiny cut when providing a service (e.g., atm fees, taxes, etc.). you might be using several of those right now, and that's great. but additionally, i've been hard pressed to find more creative examples that deviate from these formulas. perhaps it is because they work so well (after all, write code once and sell it a thousand times is pretty damningly attractive), but perhaps there are also many others, simply unpopular due to poor implementation or too obscure for a guy like me to notice.	2008-04-02 11:16:46 UTC	4	2	2

4146747	ask hn: how to write code that can be taken over by others?	i am an experienced programmer and about to start a community funded project. if things work out fine, i will be payed for one month writing lua code (for luatex, but that won't matter i guess). after that month, the perfect situation would be a working piece of code where more people will jump in and fix bugs, enhance it and such.<p>this code will require expert knowledge (opentype and tex knowledge).<p>what are guidelines to write code so that other people have a chance to jump in? the current piece of code (which we want to replace) is mostly a black box to us and is too clever (for some definition of cleverness) and more or less undocumented (it has other problems as well, but they don't matter here).  what is your advice here? some things are obvious: documentation, unit tests, getting other people involved as soon as possible, writing with "openness" in mind etc. but my fear is that i end with complex code which has the same problem as the now existing code and i will be the only person maintaining it.<p>can you give advice how to lower the barrier for other people? anybody has practical experience?	2012-06-22 13:54:14 UTC	4	8	3

4005669	being a b student bringing me down...	hey<p>as the title suggests, being a b student throughout university has really been killing my confidence. i think to myself, if i can't do school right, how can i ever do a startup? or even contribute at a successful company? i remember while reading steve jobs' biography his insistence on keeping b players out... and for good reason i figure.<p>my history is as such: deemed "smart" in high school, i decided to do engineering, not really knowing what it was. at least i've come to very much like it over the years. my first year completely took me by surprise, i didn't really try (that oh-so-useless self excuse) and ended up with bs. second year came around, and i really did start trying, but still, same result... third year, same thing. due to my marks i was never able to get good summer research opportunities (why not choose the a students?) which i feel is really closing doors for grad school for me.<p>but i don't even care so much about that as it really drains on me mentally. i need to drastically reframe this somehow, and come up with a plan of action to get myself going. this summer i'm trying to work on a side project at least, but i'm also tied up between trying to pre-study for other courses i could take in my last year to try and raise my grades. i honestly can't decide what the right course of action might be.<p>yeah there's kids who don't get to go to college and kids who are starving and all that... but if anyone were to try and give me some other perspective i'd be very appreciative.<p>cheers	2012-05-22 00:36:38 UTC	5	2	1

2091533	two new behavior-driven development libraries for objective-c (nu/macruby)	last week i have released two bdd [1] libraries based on bacon [2] (a rspec clone) optimized for nsrunloop environments. they should both still be considered ‘beta’, but i want to get the word out so adventurous people can start scrutinizing, err improving ;-)<p>* nubacon [3]: a port of bacon to the nu programming language [4], but rewritten in such a way that it properly works in a runloop based environment. this means that running the specs does <i>not</i> halt the main thread and specs can schedule blocks with assertions on the runloop for later execution. for now it's only in time (seconds), but this could be extended to use kvo to trigger running the block of assertions etc. i'm still working on the ios runner, but there is a bug with nu on ios that i have to work on first. however, if you do want to try this out please let me know.<p>* macbacon [5]: a fork of bacon, for macruby, with the exact same runloop-aware code i implemented in nubacon backported to macruby. nota that i haven't used this code in a project yet, but needed it for a project i'm starting on today. (if that's not test-first i don't know what is.)<p>once i have done proper releases i'll write a few tutorials.<p>[1] http://behaviour-driven.org	3

4945986	ask hn: what can i do about bad professors? 	i've taken classes with some pretty rotten teachers in the past, but a couple of my profs this term were especially awful. i want to know what i can do about it. i have no interest in being unfair or revengeful, but i do want something to change.<p>it's my job to take responsibility for getting what i want out of my classes, and while i think that's generally a solid policy, i also think it's reasonable to hold professors to a certain standard. it would be ideal to just avoid the bad ones, but there's often little selection or information.<p>i'd appreciate some advice on what i can do about it. what can i do during the term? what can i do to complain now that classes are over? i was thinking about writing a letter to the dean, but i have a suspicion that won't have any effect. has anyone worked in the university system? is there a best way to do this?	2012-12-20 02:24:39 UTC	7	24	0

1480187	ask hn: source for important, brief, programming news?	is there a blog, rss feed, or twitter account out there that provides brief descriptions of only the most important news stories for programmers?<p>something where the titles tell the important details, where the authors aren't trying to meet a quantity quota and are fine going a week w/o an article if there's been nothing significant, where the topics are fairly general (i'll keep a close eye on my personal stack on my own), something with a philosophy along the lines of "only the stuff that you absolutely must know as a developer" or "things that will still be important in a year."<p>when i look at the news sources i go to daily i can't help but think that 99% of what i read won't matter tomorrow, let alone in a year. i'd really like to just ditch it all (side question: anyone done this for an extended period of time? experience?), but i'm hoping there's a way to get just the 1% that's important.<p>i tried to think of some topics and stories from recent months that i'd want to know about if i canceled all other news sources, here are some:<p>- google buys ita, $700m	2
- eclipse helios 3.6 released	1
- oracle buys sun, $7.4b	0
- java play 1.0 released, a popular rails-like framework	3
- iphone 4 announced, renames iphone os ios, anounced iads, available june 27, new: very hi-res screen, video chat on wifi, multitasking	4
- ubuntu 10.4 released, faster boot, dark (less orange) theme, social networking features integrated	1
- new macbook pros	4
- hp bought palm, $1.2b, webos on printers/tablets?	4
- amazon bought woot, plans to stop retailing and just produce monkey rap	2
- chrome 6 released, new: vp8, built-in pdf support	3
- flash 10.1 released	2

- android 2.2 released	2
- x,y,z will support google's vp8 codec in html5	1
- rip, i mean rim, buys qnx	0
- android 2.2, faster with jit	4
- rails 3 beta<p>so basically acquisitions, major releases of popular languages, frameworks, libraries, and hardware.<p>you get the idea. so yeah, know of anything like this?<p>alternate questions: thoughts on interesting-information (noise) overload? ideas for creating the proposed news source? i haven't watched the points on hn stories much, but maybe the stories with the most points correspond well to this list? (i wouldn't be surprised though if they correspond more to entertainment than "what will matter in a year.") maybe a group twitter account run by programmer editors? other ideas?	2010-07-02 04:37:31 UTC	8	1	4
3825271	zombified how do hn bans get decided?	quick question: how does hn decide that an account is a spammer? is it keywords, flags, down-votes, or just sheer dumb luck?<p>my main account is in pretty good standing - i don't think i've ever had many down votes, i comment more often than i post, and my 'average' is 2.5 (which isn't too bad, i think, for an account which is less than 150 days old).<p>anyway, somehow i appear to have displeased the hn ban machine, with an ask hn and one link that i tried to post today both being particularly absent from... well... public view.<p>to be fair, i don't post that often, so the idea that i would try to post two things in a day is an oddity for me, but they were both blacklisted before they got out of the gate, so i have no idea what's going on.<p>i'm a zombie, and all i want is a little hope or understanding.	2012-04-11 00:31:43 UTC	8	1	2

3331795	the hellish world of self promotion for the indie game developer	hi everyone,<p>we've just launched our first game for ios devices, dog park, http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dog-park-top-dog/id481105799?mt=8 (shameless plug), and while we'd like nothing more than to sit back on our haunches (hilarious pun!) and take a breather for a bit it seems like we've just climbed the mountain of development only to encounter the enormous chain of a mountain range that is marketing your app.<p>like a great deal of small indie game developers out there, we were heavy on tech experience but not so much in the marketing department. in some ways, i'll confess that my few experiences with marketing companies has often left a bad taste in my mouth: the marketing reps seem to lack knowledge about what they're selling, there's a feeling that they don't care about the product, or worse they seem to think little of the end user. now that the shoe is on the other foot, so to speak, and i'm in the position of trying to get the word out about our great, new, amazing, best ever, innovative, ridiculous hyperbolic adjective game, i'm realizing what an uphill battle it really is. "duh!", i'm sure you're thinking - but it's still a "duh" that you can only really realize when you're finally in the muck of trying to sell on the app store.<p>it's not enough to craft a new idea into a solid and appealing product, getting it in front of the people who would appreciate it is the real battle. the app store is full of so many wonderful games that artists and developers have poured a lot of their time, effort, and themselves into - unfortunately it's competing against those games with bigger ad budgets and best connections in the industry. that's not to say a small game can't make it - look at little wing as a recent example - and it happens enough that small developers all over the world still keep rolling the dice to try and get into this market. it's just that the odds seem very slim indeed these days to get your game noticed.<p>so, what do we do as small developers? do we turn into auto-bots, spamming everyone on twitter and email and hope that eventually something sticks? that doesn't seem very appealing to me and i doubt it does to most of you here, either.<p>i understand that there's no magic bullet - nothing is easy, things take time, patience is a virtue and all that. i just wanted to reach out to everyone here to hear what their thoughts were and whether they had any tips for a small company (there are three of us here, four if you count ziggy the dog) who are feeling a bit emotionally spent these past few days.<p>thanks everyone!	2011-12-08 23:54:30 UTC	10	6	4

2690454	show hn: backbone js key-value observing	https://github.com/bruth/backbone-kvo<p>i've come to appreciate the various libraries in my current javascript stack including: jquery, backbone (and thus underscore), and requirejs. the one thing missing is key-value observing between my dom elements and my data. i was hoping the jquery datalink api would have matured, but the scope of the api is limited and the implementation is somewhat confusing to me.<p>so i decided to start writing one that initially assumes backbone (since it has events built in). since backbone's controllers aren't traditional controllers, i linked the dom element via the view to the model the view represents. there are quite a few assumptions being made in the implementation and lots of room for improvement in the api, names of things, and performance.<p>if you clone the repo, you can just open index.html since i pre-built the js for the time being. thanks.	2011-06-24 00:11:58 UTC	12	0	0

blog about the docu: http://startup-dna.tumblr.com/	2
twitter: twitter.com/@startup_dna<p>the docu is about startups, venture capital, programming and education. i'm bootstrapping this out of my own pocket and it's my first documentary. my ambition is to make this film as authentic and 3-dimensional as possible. i'm showing accomplished entrepreneurs and underdogs who just started their businesses side by side and capture their insights about startups on screen.<p>if you have ideas for people i should interview and can provide intros as well, please post their names below so readers can upvote candidates they would like to see.<p>feedback is much appreciated. thank you!	2012-11-21 21:43:12 UTC	14	9	2

8516135	ask hn: how often does hn recalculate rankings?	the hn ranking algorithm is well-known (see: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;amix.dk&#x2f;blog&#x2f;post&#x2f;19574). my question is: is the rank of every single post updated at some interval? it would seem that, in some way, this has to happen, otherwise items that are growing obsolete (on account of the gravity of time) would not move down as they should. however, it also seems impractical and prohibitively costly to constantly re-rank every single item. is the idea that time has such a gravitational effect that hn only needs to fetch all posts where the timestamp is &lt;  2 weeks ago (or whatever) and re-rank only those items since the ranking of a post submitted 2 weeks ago and one submitted 2 months ago will both be approaching zero (thereby limiting reranking to only a small subset of all posts)?	2014-10-27 15:39:41 UTC	17	6	4

8738108	ask hn: how transparent should your startup be?	i recently watched a jason cohen talk called naked business - how honesty makes money[1]. i&#x27;m the founder of the bike index, and i think we had bought into all the quasi-marketspeak that makes the bike index sound like a big company, when being transparent about our size and limitations seems like a better strategy.<p>i opened a github issue[2] and revised our about page. i asked everyone i could about whether this was a good thing and the general response was yes.<p>so hacker news - is this honesty a good thing? should we be even more transparent, for instance by publicizing our burn rate? if we start to look for investment, is being up-front about being excited to run the bike index regardless of whether it makes money a good thing?<p>[1]: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;vimeo.com&#x2f;96685927	0

652354	help: i want to find a tech co-founder in los angeles	i live in calabasas, ca (its in the san fernando valley if your familiar with l.a.). i am 23 years old and graduated last year from u of arizona. i currently run a technology consulting company called omni solutions. i do basic web development, marketing, computer repair/maintenance, and other tech consulting. its only me and when i get a big job i usually use elance, guru, or odesk to outsource the work.<p>but i hate it.. really, really hate it. omni is just for spending money (while i live with my new roomates -mom and dad) and try pursuing the startup life.  all i want to do is start a startup...in fact start a lot of startups.<p>i have created some basic sites using my limited skills in html and css (i have never programmed php, java, asp, etc). i have created a similar service to haro with better matching and no media filtering (called findasource.org) and i am currently developing a craigslist style site dedicated to bartering locally.<p>but i am really looking for a local hacker to bounce ideas off of and start some businesses together.<p>i have read almost all of paul's essays and one thing that sticks out is how hard it is to find a tech co-founder (especially when you are not in one of those tech hub cities). but i thought i might shout out my request to hn in the hopes that someone responds.<p>if you would like to talk - email, phone, beer, coffee, lunch (i'll buy), my email is<p>bryan (and then the at sign) myomnisolutions.com.<p>and if you have any suggestions for me to find a tech co-founder in la, that would be great too. i don't even think there is a technical school close to me that i could solicit to. i would love if a y-combinator clone started in los angeles.	2009-06-11 06:25:09 UTC	24	15	1

2102051	ask hn: review my startup - easyjerk.com: couch mode for porn	nsfw<p>http://www.easyjerk.com/<p>easyjerk is a novel approach to a tube site.  the main idea is to stop wasting time navigating a website, and just focus on what you are there to do–watch videos.<p>the two main features that make it unique are:	2
1. tag based browsing/discovery	0
2. super fast skipping ability<p>basically, the player just gets a neverending feed of videos, and you can just click skip as many times as you want until you get to a clip that you like.  for each new video, tags from that video appear on the left hand side.  if you click those tags, then your stream of videos are limited by those tags (appearing at the top left).  this lets you direct your video stream interactively while you're watching it, so far i've gotten lots of great feedback from both guys and girls, i'm curious to hear more.<p>from within the player, it currently only does a union on tags... i haven't come up with a good ui convention for this :(<p>as far as monetization is concerned, every video has a link to the site that the video came from (appears in the lower right).  my theory is that, the more videos someone sees, the more likely they will see one that makes them reach for their wallet.  i am heavily against the idea of advertising.<p>my real goal is to sell this thing early, because i have another startup that is much more pg that i want to fund, but who knows what will happen.<p>if it's not obvious, i was heavily influenced by this: http://vimeo.com/12239333 (specifically ryan trecartin's idea's about removing the context from videos–which coincidentally works great for porn)<p>would love to hear what you guys think,	3

7425905	ask hn: how to land a startup internship as an undergrad?	there are plenty of articles and blog posts about preparing for job interviews, but very few cover internships; specifically technical engineering internships. as an undergrad i often feel pressured to grasp at the latest and most hip technologies simply to be marketable in that sector (ie putting new obscure javascript libraries on our resumes.) it seems that many hiring managers are looking at existing skills in interns rather than the prospective to learn and contribute.<p>the truth is most undergrads are in the same boat; we have taken pretty much a standard set of courses, done a couple of projects and fundamentally learned only a small set of  languages&#x2f;frameworks&#x2f;etc.<p>so the question is, how do we differentiate ourselves just to get through the resume screener? for me personally it is even more complicated as i am a math and physics major with expertise in fundamental technologies yet a big appetite and willingness to pick up new skills on demand (and that i can do well and quickly!)<p>any tips for undergraduates for marketing ourselves the best way are appreciated. (obviously if there are people looking for engineer interns with a math physics background please do reach out to me :)	2014-03-18 23:49:14 UTC	1	0	0

5136237	ask hn: what is a realistic amount of time given by advisors?	ask hn: what is a realistic amount of time given to a pre-seed,pre-product startups?<p>as many of you may know advisors can be key to a new startup, esp. with first time entrepreneurs.i wondered, how much time have your advisors say over the last month talked to you?my advisor (as many others are) is super busy with selling a company right now and is on travel every other week...something that wasnt the case when we started together ~ 2-3 months ago.<p>the problem is - he is punctual for our meetings on skype or in person, but when it comes to responding to emails lately - i havent heard in over a week since i last sent him an email - and he is yet to respond.i do see him come onto gmail...through gmail chat, but he never responds.i wondered are my expectations say within a few days realistic in terms of response? is this guy just too busy for my startup with his own life/startups or what?<p>first time entrepreneur, we havent signed docs yet formalizing any equity but we have discussed he will get a little (1-3%) eventually.	2013-01-29 21:02:11 UTC	1	0	4

6555821	twittstorm is a web app that monitors tweets in real-time	type in your favourite keyword to see just how much of a twittstorm it&#x27;s creating right now. sit back and watch the tweets fly in! that&#x27;s right - every single tweet in the whole wide world that contains your chosen keyword, popping up on your screen in real-time.<p>you might get a breeze, or a gale, or a storm. but a true twittstorm is anything over 120 tweets per minute, and at two tweets a second, unless you&#x27;re some kind of super-sonic speed-reader, you&#x27;ll probably want to throttle the speed back a little to keep up. twittstorm provides the tools for the job. you can limit the flow of tweets to a rate that&#x27;s good for you, and you can filter your keyword in any way you like (to look only at links, hashtags or retweets for example). you can use keywords in any language and you can filter the results by language too.<p>twitter is one of the fastest moving social platforms, and it&#x27;s great fun to watch the world spread the word about the hottest trends and topics as it happens. you can keep an eye on the movers and shakers* in the twitter world, you can trace particularly heavily tweeted links back to the source, you can see the big picture. you need never miss out on anything ever again!<p>the stormiest twittstorms can be found on the home page and you can bookmark your own favourite twittstorms and share them with others.  if you happen to be a chrome or safari user who&#x27;s into whale-song or very abstract jazz, we think you&#x27;ll rather enjoy the audio interpretation of twittstorm too.<p>there&#x27;s no need to login, no need to register and it&#x27;s totally free. so what are you waiting for? why not push the boat out and set sail into the twittstorm?	2013-10-15 19:41:36 UTC	1	0	4

1216001	ask hn: opinion on premium private git/svn/hg hosting	i've been working on an enterprise software development portal for the last two years and i'm now close to a beta product.  i was never planning on deploying my portal as a hosted/cloud solution, but i've been thinking lately this might make sense in the beginning.<p>what i want to know is what are your opinions on premium private git/svn/hg hosting?  the services that i will be offering will be unique to what github/bicketbucket/etc are currently offering and it'll also be more expensive.  below are my differentiating features:<p>- private virtual machine for each company. this is for security and privacy reasons.  each virtual machine will have their own unique root password and you won't have login access. the root passwords for each machine will also be stored in encrypted form on our side.  we will also offer encrypted filesystems via truecrypt to ensure your source code is secure as possible.<p>- you can index your source code for any root tree.  for example, if your git repository contains 1000 commits, you'll be able to create 1000 source code indexes.  obviously the number of source code indexes that you can create will be bounded by disk space.  to put this into perspective, the linux kernel, which contains about 35,000 files uses about 200 mb for each root tree.<p>- we index the crap out of your scm repository and you can access this indexed information via the web or your command line.  this means you can search for a word on your command line, for any indexed source tree.  find the file that contains the word and then open up the file using your favorite editor. in the future we will integrate this into ides like eclipse, netbean, etc.<p>- we provide source code abstraction.  unless you have a very large code base, you probably won't care about this.<p>- we provide code churn reports (lines added, deleted, and modified from point a to point b).  you can create code churn reports on a day to day basis, weekly basis, monthly, quarterly, milestone to milestone, etc.  and when combined with our source file abstraction, you'll be able to produce some pretty useful metrics.  for example, you'll be able to break down churn based on modules, software licenses, internal tool changes, by committers/authors, etc.<p>so as you can see, we are definitely targeting users who need more of an online enterprise solution.  we will also have a different charging method compared to the other hosting sites.  we will charge based on disk space usage, like others do, but we also charge based on how many unique elements (git blobs if you are familiar with git) that are in your repository.  since we do so much indexing, we have to charge appropriately, which means the more complex your code base, the more we will have to charge.  to put this into perspective, the linux kernel contains about 500,000 unique elements. the rails project contains about 14,000 elements.<p>i haven't figured out the pricing, but i'm guessing a small organization with about 10 programmers and small code base (10,000 or less unique elements) will be charged about $500-$1000 a month.  for a small shop, it will be like paying $6,000 - $12,000 a year for an employee to ensure your source code is managed properly and have access to some pretty useful indexed information from anywhere in the world.<p>given what we are thinking about, do you think there is a more market for premium private git/svn/hg hosting?	2010-03-24 15:58:19 UTC	1	0	1

2474739	ask hn: review my startup, xuland.com	good morning hn,<p>i presented my site, xuland a while back on hn but being a newbie the link/submission was closed for comments soon after.  i've made considerable changes since then and even started working on a mobile app - or at least a mobile "web" app that should suffice until the native android/ios versions are complete.<p>i started working on xuland back in oct, 2009 as a hobby/side-project.  at first, i was looking to create an alternative to craigslist - a site with a commenting engine similar to facebook/etc but with a map and geolocation features.  since then i've migrated away from that idea.<p>i don't think the world needs another social networking site necessarily but xuland does offer some location-based features which i think folks could really come to find useful.  under the deals tab for instance, the restaurant.com search is better than their own website.  i also added an affiliate id to the deal url's so there's a potential for monetization there.<p>i've gotten around 8,000 unique visitors worldwide since i went public, but going public involved nothing more than a blog post and a mention on some small sites like killerstartups.  my blog post has risen to become the 4th most popular blog post on adobe feeds in the past year (http://feeds.adobe.com/index.cfm?query=bymostpopularyear) even though i'd say its contents are now probably outdated.  one point to mention:  the site is built using flex/flash so i apologize to ipad users in advance.  i <i>am</i> working on the app versions.<p>i'm interested in what the hn community thinks of the idea and its implementation.  any advice or criticism?  i plan on moving forward with releasing it to the public more and more to drum up traffic if possible, stress-test and pinpoint areas for change.<p>i appreciate all your feedback! ;)<p>sincerely,	1

2329562	shown hn: an example of how to lie and get backlinks. 	i'm a member business in an organization called local first arizona (www.localfirstaz.com), an advocate group for supporting local businesses that apparently has devised a deceitful way to grow their seo.<p>i just received their letter for an annual renewal. there is a section entitled "how to improve your own ranking on google and others" with the following text:<p>"did you know - by linking your web site to us, you improve your ranking? so when someone searches google, we and you have a better chance to be listed at the top of the page and not the bottom [...]" it goes on to include information on how to setup a link with the proper anchor text or banner image.<p>now i'm no seo expert, but last time i checked google doesn't give you jack for linking out to other pages. if anything your ranking is diluted. however, their several thousand, technology challenged, small business members <i>will</i> jump at the chance to get all that google juice on the interwebs.<p>i really haven't decided if i think this clever or dishonest.	2011-03-15 21:47:19 UTC	1	2	2

3092721	ask hn: is there room for a new blogging service?	this may be a little bit ridiculous, after all, there are wordpress.com, blogger and tumblr. but the sad fact is, i have so far been unable to provide my non-technical friends and family with blogs. tumblr (maybe the best bet) turned out to be too slow and erratic when i evaluated their interface, blogger is ugly and has mandatory blogger-branding (i think), and wordpress.com has intransparent pricing (i can't figure out how much they cost from their homepage). furthermore, wordpress is based on php - i could never figure out how to properly host multiple wp blogs on my debian server, and in general i don't trust php so hosting it myself makes me feel very uneasy.<p>for those reasons i plan to migrate my blogs to octopress/jekyll, which is of course not an option for non-techie people. but it made me think, maybe a similarly clean interface could be presented to non-techies anyway (kind of like jekyll without the command line). the problem with existing blog engines seems to be that they are overloaded with ajax and features.	2011-10-10 08:00:04 UTC	1	5	0
1598317	ask hn: regular expression to remove script tags and their contents?	hello,<p>i am currently working on a ruby web parser for reading webpages and extracting the text only.  i am using the following lines of code to strip scripts, styling, and tags:<p><pre><code>    cleaned = html.gsub(/&#60;[^(&#62;|\/)]*?script.*?&#62;[^&#60;]*?&#60;.*?\/script.*?&#62;/, "")	2
cleaned = cleaned.gsub(/&#60;[^(&#62;|\/)]*?style.*?&#62;[^&#60;]*?&#60;.*?\/style.*?&#62;/, "")	0
cleaned = cleaned.gsub(/&#60;\/?[^&#62;]*&#62;/, "")	0
</code></pre>	1
the only problem is that if the script tag contains a less than sign such as:<p><pre><code>    &#60;script type='text/javascript'&#62;	3
var foo=3;	3
if(foo&#60;5) {	2
alert("bar")	1
}	0
&#60;/script&#62;	3
</code></pre>	0
in that case the first regular expression for removing script tags and their contents does not work.  it all boils down to the part of the regular expression:<p><pre><code>    [^&#60;]*?	0
</code></pre>	1
i can't seem to figure out a better way though to make the star grab everything in a lazy fashion (in other words don't match the first opening script tag with the last opening tag in the html).<p>has anyone else worked around this problem in the past?  are there any regular expression ninjas who might be able to lend a hand?<p>i thank you in advance for your time and consideration.	2010-08-12 15:29:41 UTC	1	5	4

one of us has some experience in html and css and can get more proficient in it if needed, but he is a software developer and not a designer... so we ask ourselves, if any of you ever been in that situation before, what did you do? did you try designing yourself with some templates/from scratch or hired a pro to do the work?<p>thanks!	2012-07-17 06:47:06 UTC	1	5	3

1539382	ask hn: is fixing real complex bugs worth less than shipping shiny new features?	i joined my company at a stage where they just had a major release, so i was tasked with fixing bugs in the existing system. i was pretty good at tackling complex bugs that nobody else could, so the more bugs i fixed the more bugs i got assigned. i also worked with real customers who reported those bugs, and made sure the fixes got to them.<p>after a while, new people joined the team, and some got to work on some new projects with some cool new features.<p>a couple years later, those working on new stuff got promoted faster and supposedly bigger raises.<p>they worked very little on the legacy code, if at all. they just implement new stuff, and ship, and get rewarded, even if nobody is really using what they implemented. because nobody uses it, very little bugs are reported, so they can easily go on to the next cool new stuff. they have more visibility even though their work might not be that hard or valuable.<p>it seems this is the way things are, at least in my company. i wonder how things are in other places in the software industry? is support/maintenance and keeping customers satisfied deemed less worthy and less valuable than shipping new features?	2010-07-22 20:05:36 UTC	3	0	3

111499	for hackers: how long to learn .net?	i'm a non programmer with no coding knowledge who is working with a .net/java programmer of 9 yrs on a startup.  i'm keen to be able to help out, but expect that would take years.  at the very least, i think it will be useful to understand how difficult certain things are and what is involved in tasks.  what is the best way forward for me to learn (any resources that help speed the process up and make it interesting are welcome) and how long would it take?	2008-02-07 22:42:21 UTC	4	9	0

2883738	ask hn: good books and resources about computer simulations.	hi hn,<p>computer simulations - things like flocking algorithms, cellular automatas, cfd, monte carlo methods, etc. - seem to be an useful tool for understanding and solving real-life problems.<p>could you reccommend some good books and/or other resources about computer simulations? something that would help to learn how to choose a proper type, design a simulation for given problem, what to look at, how to validate it and what are the common pitfalls to avoid. i know that every type of simulation has some extensive literature about it, however i've never seen anything more general so far.<p>thanks!	2011-08-14 14:39:13 UTC	7	2	0

these compression services <i>mostly</i> strip out "extra whitespace" and "comments" to speed up execution times, but compressing makes the file look messy.<p>these online compression services allow you to do a couple of things, but i am not sure which is more beneficial (if at all).<p>option #1: upload and combine js files to consolidate and compress.<p>option #2: just compress files keeping them separate.<p>if anyone has a recommendation please share. thanks fellow hackers.	2012-02-15 21:02:24 UTC	7	10	1

2306601	show hn: friends on netflix	http://www.friendsonnetflix.com<p>about a year ago netflix removed their friends feature, where you could see your friends' ratings.  this was a great way to discover new movies, but according to them only 2% of their userbase cared.  so a few months ago i built this web app to recreate that and more.<p>my goal was for sign-up to be as simple as possible.  i don't even ask for your email (maybe i should though?).  when you connect your netflix account it pulls in your ratings/reviews.  when you connect your twitter and/or facebook, it'll find your friend's profiles and follow them.<p>this was my first attempt at creating something in python on google app engine.  having to denormalize everything was a challenge, but it seems to be working and the task queue came in handy.  supposedly it will now scale to millions of users.  good ol' premature optimization.<p>the netflix api is kind of a pain, in that they don't provide a direct way to get all your ratings.  for the initial import, i have to check every title you've ever  rented/watched/queued to see if it has a rating.  there also isn't any date information associated with your old ratings :(<p>i hope to find better ways to encourage people to share the site with friends.  so far hardly anyone follows anyone, merely using it as a backup.  this site is a lot more interesting with friends.  i even have browser extensions that show your friend's ratings within netflix.com<p>any suggestions/feedback is appreciated.  thanks!	2011-03-09 21:45:48 UTC	8	5	3

4265377	ask hn: next steps for professional translation startup	---------------<p>site description<p>---------------<p>linguaquote was created to provide a platform for <i>quality</i> language service providers (lsps – both freelance and agency) to present themselves and be compared in terms of expertise, location and price in a quick to use interface with no registration.<p>the lsps displayed have all been pre-approved by national translation associations, higher education, translation specific qualifications and finally vetted on-site to ensure that only established professionals are displayed to buyers.<p>this is not the case on other platforms, even the largest of these, and it should remove a lot of the doubt and uncertainty in sourcing translation. just pick your linguist with the matching expertise (aerospace, financial, legal, medical etc. etc.) and budget level or location and make a start.<p>for multi-language projects i will create a new user role for buyers to save their project details and store their files in their dashboard, if they’d rather register and do so. as it stands quotes are generated on an individual language by language basis.<p>----------------------------<p>https://www.linguaquote.com<p>----------------------------<p>despite being a long-time tinkerer, i’m no designer or coder (as you’ll see!) and i’ve put this together with drupal (6), a custom module and lots of contributed modules as a ‘solo founder’. bootstrapped is the name of the game.<p>i’ve 150 free users since launching earlier in the year, and now i’m looking to move out of mvp mode. i’ve got a d7 version in the works (removes need for custom module, all handled by cck, if you’re into drupal) and will incorporate the above-mentioned project management dashboard for buyers.<p>now, i don’t want perfection-paralysis or feature-creep to set in, of course, before a wider roll-out, and i know enterprise plan users will mainly want a decent amount of leads coming in rather than project management tools, but i still tend to think that it would help justify the spend if users could manage multilingual projects. it would have the added benefit of retaining and staying in contact with buyers through their accounts.<p>should i hold back on marketing and sales until this new version is complete? or would my mvp be enough to continue testing reactions and feedback?<p>-----------------<p>other information<p>-----------------<p>- i’ve been blogging semi-regularly on relevant topics to try to improve search traffic and create a voice, but with few backlinks that’s not kicking in yet (several months in) – i’m only sharing links online to the translation community<p>- this translation community is very wary of overly commercial startups, as more unscrupulous sites have managed to damage the industry’s reputation in the past (and present…), so convincing linguists that i’m ‘on their side’ (i’m a translator too!), trying to make the industry more accessible to buyers and less dominated by the large agencies with marketing budgets like pirate treasure hordes, is an uphill struggle<p>- as they are so wary of commoditization and profiteering (possibly in part because it’s such an academic profession), retweeting/sharing is rare if i post from the linguaquote account, but more common if i post under my personal account<p>- <i>but</i> the site was well received by the mailing list of the uk's largest translation association<p>- a recent adwords experiment didn’t go brilliantly, probably meaning i need to work on my adwords campaigns, conversion processes, or raising awareness of the utility of the site – a targeted mail campaign might help with this?<p>- my top-end pricing tier is based on patio11’s ‘don’t leave money on the table’ idea from his podcast with amy hoy [1], but perhaps i’d find this price hard to justify to buyers at present (even if one sale a month would cover that cost with ease)<p>your questions and comments are very welcome; how’s it looking, and what next?<p>[1] www.kalzumeus.com/2012/05/18/kalzumeus-podcast-ep-2-with-amy-hoy-pricing-products-and-passion/	2012-07-19 10:47:47 UTC	9	2	2

7464315	ask hn: was everyone's first web development experience extremely difficult?	i started reading hacker news about two years ago (freshman year in college), and i was instantly motivated to start coding. i decided to major in ee, and i&#x27;ve done well in my c&#x2f;c++ programming classes. i also picked up python and r for some work on personal projects.<p>however, almost all of my coding has been limited to the command line. although its been fun, i&#x27;ve been interested in designing a web-app for a while. some of the posts on hacker news make the process sound so easy, so i finally built up the motivation to start.<p>i decided to use python as a backend, since i know that language best. i chose flask as my web framework because it&#x27;s supposed to be one of the simplest frameworks for python. unfortunately, i&#x27;m struggling to understand proper file structure and basic features such as blueprints, forms, models, and controllers. most flask tutorials go over these terms too quickly for me to properly understand them.<p>i wanted to manage users on the web-app, so i needed a database. i picked sqlite. just like with the frameworks, i had to pick a solution without even understanding what the solution was doing. fortunately, sqlite and databases haven’t been as difficult to pick up as flask.<p>to control my web-app’s appearance, i picked up html and css. the tutorials on w3schools were nice, but i couldn&#x27;t imagine building an entire app manually. and then i came across bootstrap! it&#x27;s an extremely helpful framework, but again, it&#x27;s another tool i&#x27;ve had to learn.<p>one feature i wanted was interactive graphs, so i went to javascript. codecademy helped me with the syntax, and i eventually found the highcharts library. this has been the easiest tool to learn due to their comprehensive documentation.<p>learning these tools individually is tough. making them work together is even tougher. the posts on hacker news make the web development process seem so easy. was everyone&#x27;s first experience this rough?	2014-03-25 06:56:53 UTC	13	16	2

9244574	can we stop calling it currying?	i recently learned what the heck &quot;currying&quot; means. i&#x27;m sure i&#x27;m not the only one who struggled to grasp what this term means, since its name does not come from an intuitive notion of the concept, but rather it is named after haskell curry who first explored this approach.<p>a curried function allows an incomplete argument list, in which case it returns a new function that is still awaiting the missing arguments. this allows you to compose (combine) functions into new, reusable functions. a powerful tool for programmers, and yet unfortunately we give it a name that often reminds us of curry the food and nothing else.<p>can we stop calling it &quot;currying&quot; then and instead call it something meaningful? how about argument-deferred functional composition, or my preferred shorthand: argument deferral.<p>obviously, the name &quot;currying&quot; and &quot;curried function&quot; is widespread, so it would be appropriate to say argument deferral (i.e., currying) or argument-deferred function (i.e., curried function).<p>am i right to have a pet peeve about this, or should stop programming and go into marketing?	2015-03-21 23:00:26 UTC	14	40	2

<i>who in their right mind creates a button labeled "create test account" that irreversibly destroys the account of the person using the system?</i><p>and who, having committed such an atrocity of design, doesn't even help the people who accidentally click it? it is incomprehensible.<p>[edit: it gets worse, if that is possible. the method that blog post talks about is outdated. it shouldn't be used any  more. there is a much cleaner way to manage test users through official apis. they could at least edit that post to point to the up-to-date information. ]	2011-02-23 22:45:02 UTC	159	60	3

6687316	a hacker's journey: from cook to chef (3)	a small trick<p>as a developer, i&#x27;m hands-on unix, but not very familiar with the linux administration work. yesterday, i was stuck at a major problem to activate the original instance of the apache web server for the wordpress blog site. i cannot edit the httpd.conf file, although i have stopped all the other instances and made myself have root privilege to write to this file. as usual, i searched online and found people discussing some simple catches, such as caused by mistakes without root privilege, or the hosting site does not allow to edit, etc. i waited for a long time to chat with the hosting tech support and got response that it&#x27;s going beyond the support area with the vps customized environment.<p>fortunately after hours of frustration, i worked out the simple answer with the root cause that i was  trapped by myself due to my previous setting. i guess this is something those chef administrators do not want to share. but i&#x27;d like to share the bits and pieces with the detailed knowledge and tricks any startup company may bump into. there is a simple answer for that. how many people have the answer on the top your head now? i&#x27;m curious to see. please let me know if you want to have the answer, send email to danmark.clara -at - yahoo.com.<p>here are the links for previous two days:<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=6670362<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;news.ycombinator.com&#x2f;item?id=6680208	2013-11-07 03:33:59 UTC	1	1	0

consistently throughout my life (i am 20 years old) i have found myself wasting time.<p>i am not saying i need to have less fun, but quite often i will waste hours per day doing meaningless tasks such as watching a film or going on a long walk.	2
i enjoy programming and learning - the problem is that i can&#x27;t motivate myself all the time so i end up wasting hours doing meaningless activities.<p>i feel like a lot of the advice out there is written for people who have serious procrastination issues - i am more focussed compared to the average person.<p>but if i want to build something really cool and &#x27;make the world a better place&#x27; i need to inch my way towards perfect time management, but i am really struggling to do that.<p>thanks for reading, any advice?	2014-09-19 10:57:54 UTC	1	1	0

3039765	ask hn: clojurescript for clojure newbies?	is it possible to learn clojurescript without already having (at least a rudimentary) understanding of clojure proper? or lisp in general?  i have a pretty basic understanding of the ml family of functional languages (through ocaml and f#), but haven't ventured into lisp.<p>i have a strong interest in learning clojurescript. i've never felt that the dom translates to objects, so modern javascript/coffeescript frameworks feel a little square peg round hole to me. i'm not sure if the functional paradigm will work better but i'd like to give it a shot.<p>i've been working mostly on static web sites recently, so learning clojure proper is unnecessary at this time. i'd like to jump straight into clojurescript. is there any guides for doing this, or is clojurescript too young for an audience such as myself? the wiki seems to assume you are already a clojure programmer.	2011-09-26 17:03:20 UTC	1	1	3

1004210	ask hn: c/c++ knowledge severely needed?	hi guys,<p>in university we learn full time java. at work i learned php and a little bash. just for myself i learned a lot of python (i think i can use cpython and django better than php and the company internally developed web framework). but these days in many cases i get the feeling that my lack of middle class languages (c/c++) are a really bad problem. so, do u guys think it is worth investing time i could spent making money, hanging out with friends, working on open source/my blog/other contributions, going deeper in sicp/onlisp or studying more deeply what i learn in university, to get a grip at these 2 languages?<p>yes i know it is some knowledge that comes in quite handy, if u have it. but everytime u decide to go a new path u invest a great deal of time, engergy and what u could have gained with walking on known paths. what do u think?<p>i really need some guidance and some experience reports here! even if it is not from urself but some reference to other sources (blog entries, books who talk about this matter).<p>just for ur time, i thank in advance.<p>(because english is my second language: spelling and grammar comments are welcome, too)	2009-12-18 23:11:14 UTC	1	-1	2

3842887	alain delon luxury watch collection auctioned	&#60;p&#62;the auction of more than 100 &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel ceramic watches"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel ceramic watches&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; from french film actor alain delon raised an estimated $590,300 - much more than expected from the auction house cornette de saint-cyr. film icon delon, who has starred in more than 100 films over the years, has begun to sell his estate posthumously - this latest &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel replica watches"&#62;chanel j12&#60;/a&#62; watch auction was just one of several events the french film actor has held.&#60;/p&#62;	1
&#60;p&#62;an avid collector, delon had already sold off a wide collection of keepsakes from his home, including a wine collection that went for 250,412 euros. but this past &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel j12 watch"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel j12 watch&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; auction held in paris was a major attraction for the rare and extremely refined collection pieces from major brands like rolex, cartier, blancpain, audemars-piguet and vacheron.&#60;/p&#62;	2
&#60;p&#62;all of the luxurious &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel replica watches"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel replica watches&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;, 100 in total, were originally put on show in hong kong before paris, the former a place where the 76 year old is still immensely popular - which attributed to much of the shocking sale prices. several chinese buyers purchased a vast variety of the legendary timepieces over the phone for well above the euro estimate, including an audemars-piguet royal oak worn in several films (&#38;quot;comme un bommerang&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;parole de flic&#38;quot; and &#38;quot;ne reveillez pas un flic qui dort&#38;quot;) for 68,750 euros - 2,500 above the euro estimate.&#60;/p&#62;	2
&#60;p&#62;the actor, who wasn't present at the time of the &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel j12 replica watch&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; sale, made his film debut in 1957 and has worked with some of the world's most respected directors. as with so many actors, delon's personal life was one of controversy - the star was caught up in several scandals in the late ‘60s, though eventually all charges were dropped. though he has remained relatively under the spotlight this past two decades, delon appeared in a 2008 film &#38;quot;asteriz at the olympic games.&#38;quot;&#60;/p&#62;	2012-04-15 05:23:56 UTC	1	-1	4

5600063	ask hn: dividing equity with h1b investor?	(posting anonymously to not divulge anything).<p>hi community! two friends and i are launching a startup with the goal of manufacturing and operating a custom compute farm for a very specialized hpc market in the biotech industry. we will self-fund the startup with our own capital (total of $450 thousand):<p>- friend a will bring $50 thousand of capital. he is technical. he has some experience designing pcbs, and will help co-ordinate the manufacturing of our pcbs with assembly shops. he has a few years experience in the industry.<p>- friend b will bring $150 thousand of capital. he has 10+ years of industry experience and is more of a sales and marketing person. he will be crucial to negotiate contracts with components suppliers, and data centers.<p>- i will bring $250 thousand of capital. i happen to have very relevant experience, having assembled and operated a similar compute farm at a previous employer (no custom hardware though). i am technical and have helped correct some of my friends' early decisions and plans. i have unique experience with all the "gotchas" that we would encounter while running the software stack on top of this hardware. i have the ability to acquire very quickly thousands of the specialized chips we will need, without which the company would lose a lot of potential revenues.<p>there is one problem: i am currently on an h1b visa. i plan to keep my current job (i have to, since my employer is in the process of sponsoring me for a greencard), but i want to act as a "passive investor" (two lawyers advised us this was possible) while my two friends will work full-time on the startup.<p>how can we fairly divide equity between us, given that i plan to bring most of the capital (more than half), while they will do most of the day-to-day work? we talked about each of us having a share equivalent to the percentage of capital we bring in. but this seems too naive: friend a = 11%, friend b = 33%, myself = 56%.	2013-04-24 05:44:37 UTC	1	-1	1

1441448	driving  theory test uk, simple ways to pass	passing a driving test on the first attempt is a dream of every candidate but it is not an easy task. if we fail in first attempt it discourages us while appearing for next time.<p>it has been observed that about 50 % of candidates pass in their test on the first attempt.<p>it has been also observed that many candidates fails in theory test round which is very first round. sometimes it may happen that many people fail taking it while most giften beginner drivers are already well-known and sensibly familiar about the skills and rules required to be complied when driving that will facilitate them to become safe drivers.<p>for more information visit: http://www.theory-test.co.uk/asp/theory_test_info.asp<p>driving theory test at a glance-<p>the motorbike theory test is made up of two parts: multiple choice part and hazard perception part.<p>·	the first part in motorbike test is the multiple choice part consisting of 50 questions. this section is designed to test your understanding of the theory behind driving. you need to get 43 questions right out of 50 and the time limit is 57 minutes.<p>·	the motorbike test is a computer-based test at various tests centers around the country.<p>·	this section is designed to test your understanding of the theory behind driving. before the motorbike theory test starts you'll be given instructions on how the test works.<p>·	you can also choose to go through a practice session of the multiple choice questions to get used to the layout of the test. at the end of the practice session the real test will begin.<p>·	the second part in motorbike test is the hazard perception. this section is designed to test your awareness of potential hazards whilst driving. you will be shown 14 clips of 1 minute each having 15 hazards in all (1 clip will have 2 hazards).<p>·	the test is for 75 marks (5 marks / hazard) and pass marks are 44. the hazard perception part is also delivered on a computer but you respond by clicking a button on the mouse. the earlier you spot a hazard developing that may require the driver to take some action, the higher the score.<p>·	unlike multiple choice questions, for the hazard perception test there are no separate versions for different vehicles e.g. car, bike, heavy vehicle etc, each vehicle category takes the same test, however the pass mark is different for different categories of tests.<p>·	if you pass one part and fail the other you will fail the whole motorbike theory test, and need to take both parts again.<p>·	at the end of the hazard perception part of the theory test you'll be invited to answer few customer survey questions.<p>·	once you have passed motorbike test only then you can apply to take the practical driving test .<p>for more information visit: http://www.theory-test.co.uk/asp/motorbike_driving_theory_test.asp<p>mock test -<p>mock driving theory tests are much related to the real multiple choice section of the test (one question per page) but with the actual dsa theory test you are allowed to flag a question so that you can return to it at a later stage. on candidate stuff you cannot return to the previous question, so the real test should be a bit easier if you use the flagging alternative to your benefit.<p>throughout the mock tests / exams you are allowed 60 seconds per question, the time left for that question is displayed in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. so the maximum time permitted to complete the test of 35 questions is 35 minutes, 5 minutes less than the real multiple choice section of the theory test of 40 minutes.<p>the questions from the official theory test bank are under copyright. in order to comply with copyright law the questions given on the tests are not from the official theory test bank, but are very similar to those you will see in your actual theory test.<p>hazard perception test -<p>hazard perception test has been introduced in the driving theory test because new drivers are unreasonably involved in accidents, particularly in the first months after passing a driving test. it has been verified that drivers who have taken hazard perception test training have much better hazard test skills.<p>several learner drivers do not succeed in hazard perception test; mostly because they require more knowledge about the hazard test itself.<p>if we understand the concept of hazard perception test that how to score good marks, how does it works, what are the ways to which one has to come out while driving etc. it's not at all difficult to pass hazard perception test.<p>motorbike practical test -<p>·	the motorbike practical test was revised from april 2009. the aim of the new test is to improve the standard of the skill and road safety of motorbike and moped riders. this group amongst all users of the road faces the highest risk of injury or death, particularly in the case for young and inexperienced riders.<p>·	the standard motorbike practical test fee for both modules is £80.00 on weekdays and £92.00 on weekends.<p>this as all about driving theory test uk. this article contains the information regarding pass theory test online.<p>about company -<p>theory-test.co.uk is the leading website to help prepare for the uk driving test. it is the official license holder of dsa theory test question set from the controller of hmso and the dsa. the site witnesses multimillion hits every year and is the leading choice of users all over uk.<p>contact us -	2

4822071	does this make any legal sense?	from the little i know, when you purchase a dvd you can do anything with it, including reselling it.<p>the service offered by the company which is "send us your dvds, we'll stream them to you anytime anywhere".	4
in other words, remote reading of your dvd, without appliance needed on your part except the pc/viewer.	2
as far as i know there is no law to prevent you from viewing your own dvd, however you may want to watch it.<p>ownership of the dvd remains with the customer.<p>add the possibility to buy and sell dvds.<p>now everyone who uses that service can buy or sell a dvd to anyone who uses that service, without any shipping whatsoever, and with the instant ability to have it streamed, of course.<p>in effect, one purchase of a copy of a movie can now be resold indefinitely to provide people with the movie when they need it, thereby limiting the needs to those of a movie rental store, all while avoiding any other fee/tax.<p>additionally, the company could have a stock of dvds (actually digital rights containers) that can be instantly sold for streaming to customers then bought back, or physical media acquisition, and eventually resold through retail channels when they become obsolete (if the physical media is still new, as will be the case for the latest james bond movie that you needed eleventy beelion copies of at release day).<p>now it all sounds real good, but does anyone know why it wouldn't work ?	2012-11-23 13:06:11 UTC	1	-1	4

2513377	what's the point of popular?	you'd think that it's the most important thing in the world. homecoming queen, student body president, the most facebook friends, oscar winner, how many people are waiting in line at the book signing...<p>popular is almost never a measure of impact, or genius, or art. popular rarely correlates with guts, hard work or a willingness to lead (and be willing to be wrong along the way).<p>i'll grant you that being popular (at least on one day in november) is a great way to get elected president. but in general, the search for popular is wildly overrated, because it corrupts our work, eats away at our art and makes it likely we'll compromise to please the anonymous masses.<p>worth considering is the value of losing school elections and other popularity contests. losing reminds you that the opinion of unaffiliated strangers is worthless. they don't know you, they're not interested in what you have to offer and you can discover that their rejection actually means nothing. it will empower you to even bigger things in the future...<p>when you focus on delighting an audience you care about, you strip the masses of their power.

5377291	features for your rss reader project(add yours)	so, it seems everyone will compete on making a great rss reader now or reinvent it.	1
so i want to share some features i think it will be great&#62;	3
feature(1):  don't make users put the subscription link by them self, instead make the publisher submit the link and make a page for it (think of it as simple fb page)<p>feature(2): i want to follow some feeds with my friends, just be able to make group of feeds then allow to some of my friends to access it and can comment on feeds, this will be great(think of it as room you gather into it to read news).	2
or you can do this in a simple way by making another tab on public feed comments shows just my friends comments - and also can have notifications about them.<p>feature(3): i can like any post, and if the likes number be bigger than (1000 - you decide) it shows on the homepage automatically(so users can read important news from the homepage).<p>please, if you have any feature you like to have, put it in a comment.	1

i have little ruby and perl knowledge and know what rest is and routes in ror are. i feel ror is getting phased out for javascript based developments after twitter admitted the scaling problems.	2
i would like to position myself for the future too and that is why i am stating about the scaling issue. i am a rdbms dba and db development supervisor where i work on tuning and managing development for projects.	0
i am looking forward to creating something and aligning myself for the future with the latest and proven tech. please let me know where to start?<p>1. nosql? mongodb? redis? couchdb? cassandra?  please let me know which one is neat implementation that i could learn and be able to adapt to other nosql dbs on demand,<p>2. language - ruby ? python? perl? php? javascript (is it even one??)	4
3. framework?? do i need to learn framework to create stuff or can i get by with good knowledge of any new languages above in creating my own mvc or other architecture based apps?<p>any interesting new tech that i can interest a mid-level dba and dev supervisor with a knack for tuning and optimizing db code?? am just too bored......	2011-10-13 12:05:10 UTC	3	1	1

you are operating multi-national and you are using a voip provider? which one? are you happy with it? what could be better?	3
&lt;&#x2f;tl;dr&gt;<p>lets assume a startup&#x2f;company slowly grows up and goes multinational. assume further the main office is in the us, you are targeting new customers in europe and australia and to overcome timezone problems you have a support team in the us, europe and australia.<p>i guess it would come down to some providers like vocalocity (vonage) [1], ringcentral [2] and the more or less diy providers callwithus [3]&#x2f;voip.ms [4]?<p>now, i saw providers like to high-price their services and features (ring-calls, call forwarding, ...), although it is basically <i>all</i> supported by sip anyway. is that correct?<p>...and here ends my knowledge totally:	4
the way the packet travels is always source-server-destination <i>only</i> if the server is acting as a proxy? meaning if someone calls from australia to australia, but the sip server is in canada and acts also as a proxy, then there will be probably a round trip of 500ms? or is this always the case? i was reading quite a while that voip.ms is having therefore a couple of servers [5]. i have played a little bit around with callwithus and get around 130ms delay to their echo-service and about 150ms delay to hongkong (i&#x27;m in europe). then i left a skype conversation running to the us and someone called my did number with his phone and, although i have no exact numbers, the latency was terrible compared to the running skype conversation.<p>i am pretty stuck. any help, advise, or any pointing in the right direction is highly appreciated! i can&#x27;t be alone with that :)<p>thanks<p>[1] http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.vocalocity.com&#x2f;	1

9411398	ask hn: should i learn aurelia?	apologies if framework paralysis is a tired subject, but i&#x27;m at cross-point where i need to make a career oriented decision in the framework im going to choose.<p>right now, aurelia looks like it hits all the right points, and it appears to be built in a way that just makes sense and is future forward.  that said, its still so new, and does not have the same kind of exposure to employers that ember, angular, and react do.  ive already eliminated react, despite its acclaim, because i actually am looking for a full mvc-like framework as i don&#x27;t have the background in application development to know what to do with all the other pieces on my own. im coming from a &quot;brochure website&quot; background, and have been stuck in cms hell for years modifying html, css, js, and hacking at php because ive never wanted to learn it, but most cms demand it.<p>ive been looking at job listings for front end devs and see some employers asking for existing experience in angular.  backbone is mentioned almost as often, but i have not seen many asking about ember, and none as of yet asking about aurelia experience.<p>i know i&#x27;m not going to be a pro in any of these frameworks for at least a year, so i&#x27;m kind of leaning towards aurelia and crossing my fingers that when i arise from the documentation and feel confident within that framework, aurelia will be more mainstream.  at the very least i consider it a good start to get my hands dirty with es6.<p>am i crazy to try and learn aurelia at this point as a career oriented decision?	2015-04-20 23:14:36 UTC	5	2	4

73044	anyone have experience getting software patents?	i'd like to hear from people here who've had first-hand experiences in applying for software patents or otherwise dealing with them or who have thoughts on the matter.  i read pg's article on the subject(2).<p>i've always been a bit suspicious of software patents - perhaps not all, but the silly ones(1) are what everyone talks about - but now i find a situation where patenting a technique (method?  what's the right word?) that i first implemented a few years ago might be a good idea in a specific current situation.<p>also, it seems like everyone is getting them so i may some day get a bill from someone whose patent i've accidentally infringed, so there is a defensive angle to the thing.<p>i've read various articles(3)(4) about how to do this and i've printed out some software patents and read through them, trying to figure out how to state my application.  i've got an appointment with an attorney/patent agent monday afternoon (i picked her out of a list because she majored in math) but i'm wondering:<p>- really, how much should i expect this to cost?	3

- how can i do it for less?	0

- how long does it take until patent is awarded?	4
	0
- can i license the method to someone before the patent is awarded?	2

- how do you choose a patent agent/attorney or do you even need to?  (i know you don't have to, but is it a good idea?)	3

- what am i not aware of that i'll later wish i had known about?<p>thanks in advance for suggestions.<p><pre><code>  1) http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/amazonpatent.html	3

1802807	ask hn: will time off / travel help my hacker ambitions?	hello hn.<p>i'm currently a full time software developer around 10 years into my career.<p>for a long while now, i've been dreaming of trying something a little more entreprenurial - maybe starting a web application or (distant second preference) moving towards more of a 'freelance' model where i can have a little more flexibility in how i work.<p>the problem is that, as of today, i'm feeling pretty tired, burnt out and am losing my enthusiasm for technology.  for the first time in my life, i don't think i would have the energy or motivation to deliver on a side project.  more worryingly, my creativity has also ebbed a little over the last year so i'm not seeing as many business opportunities as i always have done.<p>i think it's just a minor case of burnout.<p>simple question really.  do you think that if i bin off the job and spend six months travelling, relaxing, pursuing some other hobbies, do you think the passion and drive will eventually come back and allow me to build a business?<p>i'm lucky enough to have maybe 3 or 4 years of living expenses in the bank if it all goes south, but at the same time, looking at my finances (a few years away from paying off mortgage etc), i would rather keep my head down for another few years on the daily grind if i didn't think that entrepreneurial spirit was going to come back to me.<p>though this is obviously very much down to personality, any comments and personal experiences appreciated as i'm at a bit of a crossroads.	2010-10-18 09:33:57 UTC	6	1	0

2451555	ask hn: just what exactly is "real-world experience" and how do i get it?	this is in response to an old comment by edw519: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=226151<p>i've excerpted a bit of it here:<p><i>we are constantly hearing advice like "scratch your own itch," "find problems close to you," and "code what you know," which is all good advice for finding a startup idea.<p>what then, do you do if you're not exposed to much?<p>when i spent time talking to people in sv 2 months ago, i noticed something i never expected: lots of people have very little exposure to "real world" problems.<p>people come up with "me too" startups because that's all they know.<p>sure it's easy and cheap to start a business, and if you're smart and can hack, all the more reason. but what about the giant issue hardly anyone mentions: real world experience.<p>...<p>my advice to a young hacker with lots of skill but not much experience (outside of college apps): you may want to consider getting a job for a year or two. i know, everyone wants to start the next &#60;whatever&#62;, and get rich now and no one wants to sit in megacorp's cube farm. and a startup, even a failed one, may be a better education.<p>otoh, you will acquire dozens of great startup ideas (and contacts) and avoid the "me too" trap. something to think about.</i><p>i found myself nodding in agreement as i read it, but i've been sitting here for 5 years in megacorp's cube farm and i still don't think i have "real world experience."  part of the reason may be because this particular industry (aerospace) is also its own echo chamber in many ways, but i think i'm missing something.<p>some people can enter a large organization, learn a lot of domain knowledge, and spot the pain points that can be solved with technology -- and potentially turn that into a lucrative startup or consulting career.  good for them.  but these are the sort of "pain points" that i notice here:<p>- an extreme level of not-invented-here syndrome.  i could not even get approval to use lapack for linear algebra computations.  this ends up with a lot of wasted energy implementing things that have already been done, and probably much better than an in-house solution too.<p>- a stifling bureaucracy.  it takes months of paperwork to get new hardware or software.  all along the chain are little fiefdoms of people who will invent processes and regulations to justify their paychecks.<p>- a misalignment of incentives.  ideas get shot down because they threaten somebody's career.  buggy, unstable software gets declared a "roaring success" because nobody will own up to failure.<p>- a lack of honest communication between users, customers, management, and developers.  sure, it might be true that all enterprise software is like this, but it's clear that a lot of misunderstanding could be avoided (and the associated cost of doing the wrong thing could be saved).<p>if these are the pain points of an organization, i don't see how it helps me in any way.  there's two issues:<p>(1) these are social problems, not technical, and they probably won't be solved with software.<p>(2) even if there exists a software solution, there's probably no way to sell it short of employing a sales team that costs $50,000+ to make a deal (cf. joel's article on pricing, http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/camelsandrubberduckies.html).<p>yes, these are "real world" problems, but i don't see how i'm getting any useful "real world experience" out of this sort of environment.  what <i>should</i> i be learning here?	2011-04-15 18:26:04 UTC	6	6	0

1450242	ask hn: how do you name your projects/products?	naming a product or a project is a rather interesting aspect of the development and marketing process. i am sure that a wisely chosen name gives you a head start and helps you communicate your vision to other people, and that a poor name could just as well be holding you back.<p>here are a couple of alternatives on top of mind, to get started:<p>1) use an informative naming, where the function /use of the product is reflected in the name. an obvious example is "hacker news".	0
2) a quirky name that is catchy and easy to remember. for instance, search engines tend to fall into this category. also, a lot of car manufacturers have adopted this kind of naming.	2

6183232	ask hn: how to deal with inappropriate interview questions?	a while back i had an interview with a fairly well known startup for an internship. the interviewer asked me a few personal questions - what did my parents do, do i have any siblings, what is my relationship status, whether or not my so would be willing to move, etc. at the time i was a little creeped out but i didn&#x27;t think much of it since i ended up taking an offer somewhere else.<p>&lt;p&gt;now it&#x27;s about the time that i&#x27;m going to start looking for a full-time job and i was wondering what i should say if that situation comes up again. if i say &quot;sorry, i don&#x27;t feel comfortable answering these questions&quot;, i&#x27;m afraid they might think i&#x27;m being prudish or something. i know startups are quite casual, but are these types of questions normal?	2013-08-09 01:54:43 UTC	9	4	3

7324277	tell hn: digital ocean ip addresses largely blacklisted by mipspace	advice: don&#x27;t run a mail server at digital ocean.<p>i transferred my science site and mailing list to digital ocean, and a few weeks ago found it suddenly overtaken by a growing block-range blacklist by mipspace. much of digital ocean&#x27;s ip address range is now blacklisted by mipspace, which certainly degrades my ability to send mail.<p>digital ocean&#x27;s reply to this:<p>-----------	4
at this time we are not sure if we can get this block removed. mipspace does not email abuse and anyone can say an ip is bad and eventually they block the entire range.<p>at this time only a small % of our ip space is effected, nyc1 is the only location we offer that has less than 10% of all ip space on this list.. personally, i would move to nyc2 if possible and reconsider who you email and what you email. they don&#x27;t even follow quarantine removal processes. we&#x27;re sorry we cannot accommodate your needs but will be more than happy to refer you to services that can relay to almost everyone in the world.	3
-----------<p>so on the one hand i understand their position; mipspace is a bad actor from what i&#x27;ve read. on the other hand digital ocean are in the business of renting ip addresses, with the implicit understanding that they are responsible for ensuring that this sort of block-level blacklisting isn&#x27;t happening for addresses they rent out.<p>it is a frustrating situation all round for people like myself, who carefully manage our email and play by the rules, to be stepped on in this way by a combination of parties and bad incentives.	2014-03-01 14:29:08 UTC	9	4	2

9052538	ask hn: will psychohistory ever become reality?	for those who have never read isaac asimov&#x27;s <i>foundation</i>, <i>psychohistory</i> is &quot;the fictional science which combines history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make general predictions about mankind&#x27;s future behavior. asimov used the analogy of a gas: in a gas, the motion of a single molecule is very difficult to predict, but the mass action of the gas can be predicted to a high level of accuracy. asimov applied this concept to the population of the fictional galactic empire, which numbered in the quadrillions.&quot; http:&#x2f;&#x2f;goo.gl&#x2f;09ypyw<p>asimov&#x27;s psychohistory is based on the following assumptions:<p><i>- the population under scrutiny is oblivious to the existence of the science of psychohistory.<p>- the time periods dealt with are in the region of 3 generations.<p>- the population must be in the billions for a statistical probability to have a psychohistorical validity.<p>- that human reactions to stimuli would remain constant.</i><p>given a sufficiently large population, will psychohistory ever become reality?	2015-02-15 13:24:28 UTC	9	11	2

- when you login, web server looks for that key and ... you're in.<p>this - to me - would seem to be a lot easier than what we do now.<p>inside a company we require a lot of userid/password keystrokes, one per application.  even with sso (via ldap or whatever) we still require these keystrokes.<p>in the wild internet to either remember userid/passwords, or store them in your browser, or use an add-on for that purpose.  we're still using userid/password and that sucks, when you could simply point the login at your key and bang out a passphrase.<p>but we don't do this.  the reason is probably simple, but i'm just not seeing why.	2013-03-02 23:51:11 UTC	10	21	4

7945186	ask hn: is there anyone who is looking to expand their business to s.korea?	hello, i&#x27;m a 28 year old native korean.<p>to explain a bit about myself:	0
my lifelong goal was to become a game developer, but i was forced to choose pharmacy as my university major under my parent&#x27;s pressure.	1
ten years fast forward, i ended up with a master&#x27;s degree in pharmacology and three years of experience in a pharmaceutical company.	1
(in korea, every male citizen is required to serve two years in the army. alternatively, you can apply to work in a scientific field for three years to compensate.)<p>as soon as the three-year mandatory period was completed, i had called it quits.	3
that was three months ago. afterwards, i began to make game in my room.<p>as a result of fiddling with various projects in my spare time, i was already experienced in python, javascript, c++, obj-c.<p>within a month, i succeeded in finishing two simple ios games called &quot;jumpy rabbit&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t touch 2048&quot;.	1
well, i&#x27;m not proud of those two games because they are spin-offs of the popular games (flappy bird, 2048).	0
during the development of my third game, i began to feel burnt out. the motivation was dwindling, productivity plummeted.	1
i know this is just a small setback and i will continue to make games. but i see there are other ways to make a living.<p>nowadays i keep reading these successful startup articles in hn and think: &quot;why isn&#x27;t there such thing here in korea?&quot;.<p>is there anyone who is looking to expand their business to korea, or even localize their game to korean? maybe i could help.	2
i don&#x27;t have any experience in entrepreneurship, but i&#x27;m a good learner (my english is self taught) and given enough time, i believe i&#x27;m up for most tasks.	1
feel free to contact me at groquest@gmail.com<p>thank you for reading.<p>tl;dr: a native korean jack of all trades is looking for someone who wants to expand their business to south korea.	2014-06-25 16:52:49 UTC	11	6	1

596489	ask hn: ways to obtain critical mass?	i started this for-fun-project: a highly viral site, called http://www.tjetter.com - it enables you to randomly chat with others, with the added twist of being able to eavesdrop on (and replay) other conversations that take place.<p>the dutch version is doing ok, because i was able to use my established network to get some initial visitors. however, i have barely any international contacts, so getting some exposure in other countries is rather difficult.<p>i'm looking for suggestions as to how to proceed in trying to obtain critical mass for this kind concept. ideas?	2009-05-06 19:01:44 UTC	16	15	3

3109773	ask hn: i am 23. what's next?	there are times when i find myself at work blazing away at development or outside training for a race and stop to ask myself, is this is it. not like is this what i am doing for the rest of my life, but the more general question of is this what people work towards all their life. now i am being a bit vague here, but hear me out and let me explain. it helps to have some background on my story so hold on...<p>i grew up by the city in the suburbs where you had your typical gang per neighborhood and cops cruising around the area at all times. drug deals were a regular thing during class time and it was likely that if you followed in your parents footsteps you would be pregnant at 17 and potentially graduating high school with a drug problem. most of my friends fell victim to drugs in one form or another, so i learned to steer clear of most of that stuff. plus my dad told me he would kill me if he ever found out (little did i know he had his own problem with it all).<p>my parents split apart, but before my dad rolled out he set a solid work ethic in me. that or i realized home wasn't the greatest place to be around and decided it would be best to make money while disconnecting from my "family". i started work at 14 changing oil and found the ability to make my own money was the most liberating experience ever. i made a point to ditch the required high school work forms and limits and cut a deal with my boss, 30+ hours and i would make it work. during the summer i put in well into 50 hours as much as i could and enjoyed life.<p>fast-forward a couple years and i am in high school goofing around in a networking class. i was told before joining the class that graduating from this school would land me 16 college credits and 19 if i passed the certification. call it what you will, but i found high school to be a joke, so i went to college at night starting in 11th grade and decided i would make the whole school thing go by as quickly as possible. during this time i continued to work full time, and volunteered at some tech startup doing internet sales. i also did the usual teenager activities like going to parties, hacking companies in the city, doing graffiti and running from the cops.<p>jump ahead 1 year after high school and i am working for a government contractor building circuit boards on million dollar contracts. i graduated high school early, bent the rules as much as possible and was the proud owner of an a.a.s degree in network technology. i later moved on to doing network engineering, but remained with the company for a year before making my next big leap. meanwhile at home i was planning on moving out because the situation was only getting more annoying.<p>i realized that finishing my degree was critical to making any money, so i made that my top goal, but knew i would be bored doing nothing but school. you have to understand that at this point i had pushed myself far beyond my normal means and what once was difficult was now the "norm". sleep wasn't required and all i wanted to do was work. i decided to go to a local college that took in all my transfer credits where a lot of the courses were online. i managed to re-write parts of my degree and pull 18 credit semesters while working the 50 hours as a security engineer while still having some sort of life.<p>i graduated early with my b.s in information assurance and managed to get a couple speaking engagements in the middle of that. i spoke at one of the biggest hacker conferences in vegas, on career panels with college professors and offered my advice to those who asked or listened. fast-forward some more and i have written articles for magazines, been offered crazy jobs with crazy money and have vacationed in some pretty cool spots. i have since fixed some of the issues with my family and feel as if i am becoming a more understanding person in regards to substance abuse and mental illness (things i have dealt with a lot).<p>life and work are great and just in this year i have been to canada, the bahamas, europe, california and vegas. a lot of these were for speaking, some for vacation, but all of them great trips. when i got back i would tell my family how things went or what was on my mind. in some cases i wasn't too excited over everything and the comments my family made were more or less that they wish they had my life. it wasn't that i wasn't happy with all of this stuff, but it made me wonder if this is what people worked for. was what i had someone else's dream?<p>i work at a university now doing forensic investigations and malware analysis. i could be making a hell of a lot more money else where, but i enjoy the people i work with and what i do everyday. i often stay late and base a lot of my life around doing things in the general area. because i am staff, i get tuition benefits and while i thought i would never go back to school, i am thinking now it may be worthwhile since it's free. i am not sure if i want to focus on technology or if pursuing a degree in something else would be more of my thing. either way, i think it would be nice to experience a little bit of the college scene i missed out on by rushing before.<p>outside of work i race road bikes, workout a lot, am not too social, but keep enough friends around not to be terribly bored or alone. i go on several trips throughout the year and keep life interesting through funny experiences and the general mentality that life is about stories, not salaries. i know it is who i am to continue working like i do and to do everything i try to the fullest. i am excessive, easily bored and always seeking some challenge. i am far from being old or done, but there are times when i wonder if i will burn out. will i work too much? should i be doing more? should i be doing things differently?<p>i guess the last thing i would point out is that i recognize i don't know everything and that i haven't tried everything. there is still a lot more i could be doing and a lot i could change both around me and within me. the "being a better person" aspect seems to take longer than changing what i'm surrounded by, so i hope this doesn't come off like a poor me, help me out sort of posting. it should be instead interpreted as someone who has done a decent job for being 23 and wants help knowing how to make life even more awesome. hopefully a few people will read this and understand the sort of personality i have which i think helps in these questions.	2011-10-14 03:16:40 UTC	19	18	0

3231470	ask hn: someone wants to resell our saas. what can go wrong?	long story short: we provide our software as saas, and for our type of business (online ad delivery), due to the complexity of the applications, there's a whole industry of people who make money doing the actual operations of the application (called ad ops).<p>now, our application is sold on a usage basis (use more and you pay more), and someone wants to start reselling our application by directly billing his clients instead of referring them to us.<p>what can go wrong? what can we forget? this seems like a no-brainer, since they can only make us more money, but i can't help but feel there's a snag to it.	2011-11-13 19:00:23 UTC	36	16	2

423765	ask hn: am i the only one tired of twitter apps?	practically every morning when i tune into hn, i find an announcement of at least one if not more new apps related to twitter. i always check the comments to see if anyone else is as sick of twitter apps as i am, but all i ever find are other hackers cheering them on.<p>so, am i the only one who thinks there's an enormous waste of developer/entrepreneurial resources here? aren't there more interesting problem spaces for developers to explore -- especially ones that are relevant to people outside the ubergeek set most us belong to?<p>this isn't meant to be a rant against twitter, and it's certainly not a rant against any individual one of those apps or developers working on them. (in fact, i posted this as a separate discussion because i didn't one to impugn any one developer or group's efforts.)<p>but i'm just curious if anyone else feels the same way as i do -- or if twitter is such a revolutionary new platform, akin to email or blogging, that i'm being short-sighted in poo-pooing innovation efforts in the space.	2009-01-07 18:49:18 UTC	71	40	4

9731656	independent contractor and program ownership question	i have been working as a contractor on a software project for a local university.  i started out as a consultant with no programming responsibilities as the project was unrelated to software or software development.  the contract i initially signed contained the following ip-related text, &quot;any work product, creations, written works, or improvements to any xxxx inventions created or discovered during the term of this agreement shall be owned by xxxx and shall be treated as a ‘work for hire’ under this contract.&quot;<p>as time went by my job morphed into software development role, but my contract did not change.  in the new role i designed, coded, and managed a new software program as an independent contractor.  now this program has the potential to be commercialized.  the question i have is who owns this software?  from my point of view and from the copyright law that i have read, it seems that the copyright should be mine:  1) the software does not fall into one of the nine excluded categories, 2)  i have been the only software programmer on this project, and 3)  i have not assigned the work to the university.	2015-06-17 13:40:51 UTC	1	0	1

9123981	ask hn: is there a market for another saas help desk software?	i am halfway through building a saas help desk&#x2f;customer support software but now i am having some doubts whether it is really worth the time i am putting into it. right from the start, i knew that this is a really crowded space but i still decided to start building my app for two reasons -<p>1. i think the current help desk platforms (barring maybe groove) are too complex and much more suited for bigger support teams. i thought that creating a simpler app (with less feature-bloat) specifically designed for smaller (1-5 people) support teams could be my app&#x27;s differentiating factor.<p>2. i wanted to move away from per user pricing and instead switch to a flat price of about $25 per month. also, instead of a free plan, i thought of providing an open source (self-hosted) version.<p>i am quite happy with how the project is turing out, but there&#x27;s this nagging doubt that i might be better off making something where there&#x27;s less of a competition. my aim is to make $1.5-2k per month.<p>do you think there is still a market for another help desk app?	2015-02-28 15:53:38 UTC	1	0	4

3891809	i want a damnodeinserted event	dom level 3 mutation events were deprecated a while back due to performance and implementation concerns (http://www.w3.org/tr/dom-level-3-events/#events-mutationevents - http://lists.w3.org/archives/public/www-dom/2009aprjun/0072.html). while there has been talk of a replacement for these events (http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/mutationreplacement), i began to wonder if there was a way to listen for any of them without using the deprecated mutation event interface...turns out there is, at least for domnodeinserted (the event i needed). with the method i devised you can listen for dom node insertions as long as your browser supports css3 animations. in addition, it also allows you to scope the event to a subset of nodes based on the css selector you choose.<p>check it out and let me know what you think!	2012-04-26 00:33:29 UTC	1	0	1

2.    are swedish employers willing to fight for international workers – in terms of sponsoring their work visa – if they demonstrate&#x2f;prove their talent and passion?<p>a little background about me: i worked with a couple of startups in egypt and dubai. i also have my own blog which contains articles written by me. the articles primarily illustrate my ideas on content in the digital age and how to use&#x2f;manipulate it towards having a better product.<p>*content production and marketing - copywriting - journalism	2015-07-03 05:25:01 UTC	1	1	0

3129645	ask hn: doing non-core work to generate cash-flow: y/n?	let's say, hypothetically, there was a pre-mvp startup team consisting of a couple of hardcore technical software engineers and one non-technical, suit-wearing, business jargon-spouting, commercial/mba-type, who were working on a software product. and let's say, hypothetically, that everyone was serving out their notice periods in their current jobs and, over the next six weeks or so would be freed up to work full-time on the startup.<p>clearly, in such a situation, pre-revenue, pre-funding, everyone's going to be living off their savings. and, given the product is software, the heavy lifting to create an mvp is on the technical side.<p>so if, hypothetically, the non-technical guy had the opportunity to do some contract consulting work (in an area unrelated to the startup) and thereby generate some income for the company - enough to simulate ramen profitability - would it be worth doing that?<p>the upside is that there would be some cash for expenses and salaries, which would mean that people wouldn't have to worry quite so much about how they're going to pay the rent when their savings run out.<p>the downside is that one of the team (albeit the non-technical one) would be off doing something else 9-5, five days a week, and would only be able to contribute their input to the mvp in evenings and at weekends.<p>obviously, the non-technical guy would drop the consulting gig and switch back to focusing on the startup full-time when the mvp was ready and it was time to start finding customers, talking to investors, etc.<p>thoughts, opinions, anecdotes and cautionary tales welcome.	2011-10-19 11:36:31 UTC	1	1	1

a lot of startups follow some kind of customer development model or similar, where the idea is to iteratively	0
1. modify the product	4
2. try to sell it (validate it)	2
until the business model seems to work. often it does not make sense to build a full version of the product during each iteration and sometimes even a power point presentation is enough, showing what could be built.&#60;p&#62;when you try to validate, you probably want more than one customer to buy. but what should you do if too few buy during each pivot/iteration. if you have signed the contracts with those who bought during previous pivots, you still need to deliver. having a lot of custom solutions to build at the same time as the real product will easily take up all resources.&#60;p&#62;what do others do? is it possible to somehow unsell what you have sold, or try to convince the old customers to take the real version instead, or is this just a risk that every entrepreneur has to live with?&#60;p&#62;thanks for your help.	2011-08-29 21:12:44 UTC	2	0	2

3861216	show hn: pinad.com.au - using structured data in general classifieds	hello everybody,	2
i recently published https://pinad.com.au/ and i'm looking for feedback.<p>below i explain my reasons for creating this tool:<p>there are a lot of websites in the general-classifieds market that don't allow users to describe the objects they want to advertise and this subsequently leads to very poor search capabilities. to search in an efficient manner for an object, the object has to be properly defined/described first, it's characteristics have to be made visible. if no data descriptors are available, the search is transformed in pure full-text search. when data descriptors are available, the search can provide proper filters.<p>let's take an example by describing a car...<p>...in an unstructured manner (this leads to full text search): "i have a blue ford for sale with a 2.2 liters engine..."<p>...in an structured manner (this leads to filtered search): item is: for sale | manufacturer: ford | color: blue | engine size: 2.2<p>in the above example the unstructured data has been transformed in 4 filters which are pretty much impossible to replicate in a full text search.<p>the website has about 82 categories that provide proper descriptors to enable structured posting and structured search.<p>if you want to post test classifieds, please mark them as unavailable after you are finished with them (or add a "test" in description, i will remove them later...) so they will not be indexed by the search engine<p>the indexing job runs every 15 minutes, you will be able to see your entry in the search results after that interval has elapsed.<p>the postcodes are available for australia only, you may use something like "4000" for playing with it.<p>please let me know your thoughts on this, i would really appreciate it.<p>for private feedback, please use the e-mail address available on my profile or the contact form on the website.<p>thank you. adrian	2012-04-19 03:09:23 UTC	2	0	1

3014773	tell hn: freelancers -- watch fu pay me by mike monteiro	in reading the comments of "the great lie - lorem ipsum" in regards to the necessity writing copy for the web, a large chunk of the comments mentioned that clients are often late with copy, would often bad copy, and often would passive aggressively force the designer to write copy.<p>context (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3013196)<p>don't let this happen to you. these are contract and pricing issues. it's not ok to let a client push you around, force you to do copy if you don't want to, or pay you less than they should for a service.<p>a strong contract is in place to protect both parties from either scope creep or excessive charges. if there's a pain point in your day-to-day work cycle, put it in the contract and have the client compensate you for it.<p>the video "fu pay me" by mike monteiro of mule design explains this better than i can, and comes from the experience of 10 years in business.<p>you can find it here (http://www.doobybrain.com/2011/04/07/fuck-you-pay-me-mike-monteiro-on-how-to-get-clients-to-pay-you/).	2011-09-19 18:52:29 UTC	2	1	0

2950205	show hn: usherbuddy, last-minute event tickets	hey hn -<p>was hoping to get some feedback from you guys on anything and everything related to our launch. usherbuddy is a solution that venues can use to offer last-minute tickets to consumers. compare it to the tkts booths but on the web, not only broadway, and catered towards residents and not tourists!<p>for consumers: last-minute usually means a discount to go out and discover something new. if the show is really popular the venue can increase the price if they would like. event discovery on a budget, if you will.<p>for venues: seats at a venue are perishable. incremental revenue is where they make money, so we try to help them fill the seats while still getting something for the seat. this is similar to goldstar or stubdog, but by doing it last-minute we hope to get rid of the cannibalization of sales that those services promote.<p>currently, we have venues signed up and are just trying to gauge the initial consumer reaction. would love to hear your thoughts. thanks!	2011-09-01 14:45:16 UTC	3	0	3

2132367	ask hn: best way to fund an idea 	i work as a rails developer with a firm. as a side project, i am working on an app which deals with health care analytics. bootstrapping in this domain is very difficult.<p>i can think of three ways to generate more income and fund the idea.<p>1. raise money - very difficult in india. in india, people usually neglect young guys. a lot of time and energy will be spent on explaining a relatively newer concept. will bring unncessary pressure as well.	4
2. build another products/apps/services and cross subsidize the idea - thought of it. even worked on some stuff for couple of weeks. it is very difficult to maintain focus. still, if i pull something off, it might generate some steady income.	2
3. freelancing - i did it for sometime. it went well. i am now thinking of doing it for rapid prototyping - building an mvp for someone in couple of weeks. i do not whether this is feasible or not.<p>can any hner, who has funded an idea on his own, share his/her experiences?	2011-01-23 13:28:14 UTC	4	3	3

10085203	ask hn: is it worth investing time in learning forex trading?	hello hackernewsers,<p>i&#x27;ll be right to the point. in the past i had the opportunity to try forex trading through a couple of the pretty popular online platforms that offer this kind of service. they had the feature to let you invest in the real market with dummy euros in order to make you practice with the tool before risking your actual (and real) money. i played with those fake moneys for a couple of weeks and in both cases i ended up earning (fake) revenues. in one case i started with 5000€ and transformed them in more than 7500€ in more or less ten days.<p>my question is: have i been just lucky? did the app trick me into believing i was able to earn easy profits in order to make me put my money in the account? or it&#x27;s just that forex trading is &quot;doable&quot; if you are cautious enough?<p>i&#x27;ve been wondering about seriously starting to invest some time into forex since then, but for some reason i never did. would you share your experience with me?<p>thanks!	2015-08-19 13:24:57 UTC	5	3	1
967309	ask hn:  how do you register domains for non-technical clients?	our site plans on issuing subdomains for free (xxxxx.mysite.com), and also the buy-in opportunity to choose a domain name and have it point to the subdomain via a cname.  the site is geared to a non-technical demographic, so ease-of-use is a necessity, hence this question.<p>are there any api's, reseller accounts, etc, that you've used to accomplish this?	2009-11-30 04:09:07 UTC	5	3	1

7781033	how can isps need more money for service when netflix charges only $7.99?	so here is my thought: lets take, as an example,a group of people who get netflix.  those same people use cheapbastardisp.  those customers pay $50 a month for broadband. they use that broadband to connect to netflix and download movies.  the isp screams that their customers are using too much bandwidth and netflix needs to pay them more.... this makes no sense. the customer uses the isp&#x27;s pipe and netflix pipe to download the movie. if netflix can pay for that amount of bandwidth use when customers pay $8, why cant the isps handle that amount of bandwidth on $50?<p>i seriously do not think that netflix takes up more than 1&#x2f;6th of the  total internet use of all their customers on average.	2014-05-21 22:04:21 UTC	6	11	0
2520046	ask hn: i'm at a crossroads, any input is appreciated	i’m a twenty year old from upstate new york and i’m thinking about moving to san francisco/the bay area. i’m a business student and i took this spring semester off to launch a startup which wasn’t very successful. i dropped that idea and tried to land an internship in the bay area this summer but i haven’t heard back from any of the three i applied to.<p>i’m learning to program but i don’t think i would be a good hacker intern because i don’t think i’m that good yet. i’d be a much better business/marketing guy at a startup.<p>i’m at a crossroads in my life and i could use some advice. i know this is hacker news, but i think a lot of people in this community are much more intelligent than some of business communities i take part in.<p>i think i’m facing two options:<p>1.) move to the bay area and try to find a business dev/marketing job at a startup. if i can’t i’ll work anywhere to make ends meet while i try to launch a startup of my own. i’ve been told the bay area is rich in entrepreneurship; upstate new york is probably the least entrepreneurial place in the country. i want to be around like minded people.<p>2.) my other option is to go back to school in the fall. if i do this, i’m going to have to work to get through it. my plan would be to take a real estate course this summer and then start working as a commercial real estate agent while i’m at school. my biggest concerns with this are that i really don’t have any interest in real estate, i would be doing it just for the money and between school and real estate i wouldn’t have much time for a startup. and even if i have a successful stint in real estate i would never want to become complacent and make a career out of it, which basically just makes this a means to an end portion of my life.<p>staying in school and doing real estate is a lot safer, but moving to the bay area would be a direct way to accomplish my goals. do you have any advice?<p>thank you for your time.	2011-05-06 04:55:34 UTC	6	16	0

9339341	ask hn: how to protect our service against fake requests/trolls?	we are a small startup operating a service where people make real appointments at various venues around the city.<p>to request an appointment, all you have to provide is name, email, phone number &amp; some other basic details. you also have to select the details of the appointment prior to this. it takes a normal person about 2 minutes to get from entry point to appointment confirmed.<p>we have been experiencing periodic fake appointments, which is really disrupting our business and damaging our relationship with our venues. they&#x27;re obviously created by humans, only a few a week, but we&#x27;d like better protection against these people.<p>we deal with them reactively using our admin tools and contacting people, but it&#x27;s wasting our time and the relationship damage is already done.<p>the only measure we have in place to proactively prevent this right now is strict rate limiting.<p>we&#x27;re considering:<p>- recording ip&#x2f;ua info for every appointment (then blacklisting). but thats easy for someone to get round, and they might just do it from different places, agents, etc.<p>- email verification for your first appointment, but thats an experience trade-off. we&#x27;re small and every conversion counts - so we want to avoid adding new barriers if we can. plus, some of the requests have working emails.<p>- moderating our appointments before they get passed onto our venues. this adds a barrier to the process, and there are times where requests happen when the whole team is not working or asleep. a compromise would be a delay where the team can intervene before an appointment is allowed to continue, but that makes for a worse experience for our users (+ some appointments need to be sorted out quickly).<p>- sms verification, however, we called a couple of the trolls, and they are real numbers (no response, of course).<p>does anybody have any experience of this, or any advice?	2015-04-08 08:26:32 UTC	7	4	1

"facts" i have read, please correct me in what is wrong, incorrect or missing.<p>#1 google suspected ms/bing of straight copying their search results.<p>#2 google setup a honeypot like system.  landing pages indexed bogus terms in their system.  essentially noise, that would not exist previously as a search term in either system<p>#3 google used a web browser, with the bing toolbar to navigate bogus search terms<p>#4 in turn, this user activity was used to cross link a term entered by the user to a web page in ms/bing's system.<p>so this opens up the can of worms about user privacy, content ownership (lets drag up the deep linking hysteria of several years ago), morality/legality etc etc etc.<p>but how exactly did bing violate google's terms exactly?<p>did google invalidate their own data by simply using the bing toolbar?  accepting legal terms of the toolbar, device, os by using it?<p>who "owns" the content the user "created" by typing in a search term and clicking a link?	2011-02-02 10:51:12 UTC	8	4	4

951399	ask hn: how do you deal with continuous requests for cooperation?	i get requests for cooperations and meetings day-in and day-out (mostly also for another business i am working on) and i don't really know how to handle these situations. that is also the reason why i have stopped networking because i simply don't want to deal with all the people that send me mails that "we should do something together".<p>my problem:<p>1. i don't want to "close the door" on a potential deal or cooperation because what might not be an opportunity now, could turn into something interesting later on.<p>2. i can't (and don't want to) spend time meeting people when i actually should work on my products.<p>what is your approach to deal with this dilemma of keeping people interested and open but at the same time staying focused on your current tasks and goals?<p>any recommendations to filter out the promising ones from the not-promising ones?	2009-11-19 23:08:41 UTC	8	7	3

62348	ask news.yc: raising money using bank loans?	i'm interested in hearing any thoughts that some of the other hacker news readers on starting a company using loans, and who might be the best places to approach? <p>we're a small team, about 70% of the way through a fairly hefty project. we've done most of the back-end code, but we need to contract some artwork, and want to move one of our co-founders to working ft on the project, in order to speed up development.<p>sbc style loans are offered by citizen's bank and others-	3
these loans, as i understand, typically require that you invest 30% of the loan amount into the company at the time of the loan.	3
while we've invested quite a sum over the last few months as we've been building (legal fees, etc), i don't have a huge amount of up-front capital.<p>there's private sources of capital such as america one (amone.com), but they seem very shady, and want a high percentage as a finder's fee.<p>i know we could end up going to angel investors asking for a loan, but we don't know any personally, and building lengthy presentations for investor meetings takes time away from actually building things, as well as dilluting capital. <p>we're very dedicated to the idea, and the company, and i'd appreciate any advice, thoughts, or experience as other people have gone through this part of the process.	1

(keep in mind it took a single guy <i></i>two years<i></i> to build the product)<p>language choice? golang. cto thinks vim is the one true way and everyone else is a heretic, but everyone on the team except for his buddy from another other startup greatly prefers an ide. (there&#x27;s also &quot;80 cols&quot; or the pr gets rejected: warning sign #3)<p>original schedule had us starting at the beginning of september and launching at the end of december. feature requests on the old product moved the start to the middle&#x2f;end of october. the finish date moved to the end of november.

63172	ask yc: is the bay area much better than seattle for startups?	long time reader, first time poster. thanks in advance for reading this post and extra thanks if you can reply with your thoughts. <p>i'm working full time in a software company in seattle area and will be leaving soon to work full-time on my startup.  (i already have already released a prototype of my product).  i'm tempted to stay in seattle as i love it here... but my startup is my first priority, and i'm prepared to move anywhere in the world if it means i'll have a significantly higher probability of success.  finally, i'm a single founder and potentially looking for a technical co-founder... so <i>where</i> i can find this person factors in to the decision as well.  <p>questions for you:	0
1) for those of you who have lived in seattle &#38; san francisco, how much better is sf for startups than seattle?  how do you quantify this?	3
2) i have a quick list of pros/cons to seattle vs. sf below... can folks provide feedback on whether this analysis makes sense?	0
3) any other thoughts on whether i should make the move or not?	4
4) where is better for finding like minded entrepreneurial hackers?  <p>pro/con for seattle vs. sf	2
seattle pros: lower cost of living, closer access to outdoors &#38; mountains etc..., lower cost of rent for offices, lower legal costs, less competition for top quality talent than sf (there are fewer startups in seattle so people who want to work at them have fewer choices on where to go), monthly startup events have on the order of ~50 people or so, rains often so you're more likely to sit inside coding than going outside	1
cons: rains a lot :p<p>sf pros: epicenter of startups, monthly startup events (sfbeta etc..) have on the order of ~100 people, huge talent pool of highly skilled engineers, more likely to find technical co-founder, more startup events, more access to capital, closer to family	1
sf cons: higher cost of living, higher cost of rent, higher cost of services (leagal etc..), harder to get top quality talent (you're competing with hundreds of startups), more competition for capital<p>ps:	4
i have already read pg's essays and read the ycnews forums on where to be for a tech startup.  i've also recently read marc andreessen's post on where your startup should be (he reccomends moving to the valley).  finally, i have a friend who recently quit google to work on his startup full time in the bay area and he extols the advantages of the location.	2007-10-04 19:42:40 UTC	11	25	0

1961119	dear amazon: cancel my account, you bums	greetings,<p>i am a multi-year amazon prime member and kindle user. i've spent several thousand dollars with amazon over this time. you have a fantastic shopping tool and before today, i believed, a fantastic brand.<p>i thought you understood what the internet can mean for our society and our lives. selling books and shoes is only the tip of the iceberg. the internet has the power to force transparency in the halls of power. is it not self evident, no matter your political affiliation, that waning transparency relates to higher corruption and hurts all citizens as a result? exactly who are you counting on to keep our elected officials honest these days - fox or cnn? some one has must step up to do the job that our institutions won't.<p>your behavior today was unacceptable. how can you be so close to a rare source of positive change in our world and roll over so quickly? your business is built on high availability, distributed data. he is leveraging this very thing to bring freedom through accountability. isn't this worth supporting or at minimum keeping a channel open by accepting payment for services rendered? don't you understand the long term implications of your actions? you must. this saddens me. god help us all if this is what an organization that "gets it" decides is in their best interest.<p>you are, for the time being, still free to do what you choose. but so am i and i won't support you. cancel my account you bums.<p>johnny	2010-12-02 05:23:08 UTC	17	1	4

2043880	ask hn: what is the optimal sign-up process?	big internal debate. obviously trying to keep as many visitors as possible. in this case, we're not so focused on  retention; more focused on participation (could be one &#38; done)<p>some examples that are being tossed around include layers.com (strictly email), quora (email + password)...most others ask for 4-5 input options.<p>1) strictly asking for email address up front	1
--&#62; sends random password --&#62; forces you to copy &#38; paste --&#62; then change to your own later<p>2) asking for email &#38; password	2
--is it an absolute necessity to include 'confirm password?' if you mistyped, you could just use 'forgot password' link to recover.<p>3) asking for email, password x2 and name / username?	1
--i think 'name' &#38; 'username' are optimal for b2c startups, while 'name' is plenty for b2b products -- fair enough?<p>also, any opinion on when sign up process is most appropriate on it's own separate page?	2010-12-27 22:40:14 UTC	20	6	2

6007899	ask hn: aren't ember and angular a "wrong" kind of framework, similar to j2ee?	i&#x27;m looking at the new wave of javascript frameworks (backbone, ember, angular)	3
and can&#x27;t shake the feeling they are much more similar in style to j2ee than to	0
more saner rails or django. they take you out of control of your code - they	1
call you and you must fit their world view. they are &quot;everything&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot;	0
at the same time - they offer you &quot;everything&quot; to build a web app, but at the	4
same time it&#x27;s hard to say what concrete functionality they really offer. there is little &quot;meat&quot; inside their code: it&#x27;s just an abstract model that you must work with.<p>compare it to django where in view functions you can do whatever you want - you	0
are in control of what&#x27;s happening, and functionalities you need are available	4
as &quot;library style&quot; calls. can&#x27;t javascript frameworks work like that?<p>i&#x27;m asking the question because these frameworks receive much praise nowadays	0
with little to no critique, so maybe my all-or-nothing-framework hate (i began	3
career as j2ee programmer) is inappropriate here.	2013-07-08 17:25:01 UTC	20	17	2
1738945	ask hn: pivot or kill it?	hi all,<p>a few months ago, i created a web application (gisconverter.com) that converts gis files from one format to another. initial market research led me to believe that there was a decent sized market for such an app. however, a month through advertising using google adwords shows that there is almost no market for this.<p>since the core idea has no market, it makes sense to let this app die. however i am unable to let go and keep trying to find ways to pivot and come up with an alternate idea around this one. i know at some level its hard for me to let go after having invested time into this.<p>any ideas on what i should do with this?<p>much thanks for your time.	2010-09-29 11:13:59 UTC	20	46	4

1179702	contract hn: build graffiti for iphone + ipad	i run graffiti on facebook (http://facebook.com/graffitiwall). it's a top 50 facebook app (with a higher user rating than any in the top 100+) that lets users draw for each other using a very simple interface. we have so far neglected to build graffiti for the iphone or the ipad and i think that's clearly a mistake since it seems like a perfect fit. obviously it's a short time frame, but we'd really like to finish it before the ipad launches in a month or so, if possible.<p>the application will be simple: the user will draw (using color, width, and opacity), and then be able to send to a friend via facebook or email. there will also be a way to view graffiti the user has sent/received, and ideally a way to replay the drawing like we have on facebook graffiti. we can handle most of the design but don't have any experience making iphone apps. it will most likely be a free application and we're going to promote it heavily from facebook graffiti.<p>should be a fun project. if you're interested, shoot me an email at hn.jobs.tmt [at] gmail.com with your resume and links to any iphone apps you've built, plus your rates.	2010-03-09 23:36:19 UTC	26	1	2

6584045	ask hn: should i go to sweden for work?	i have been freelancing from home in moscow, russia for 4 years now as a frontend developer and as a self-taught ui&#x2f;ux specialist. there were good and bad times in regard to work&#x2f;life balance, money, clients and myself. i am not a famous rockstar freelancer, but during recent 2 years i have been earning $7-$10k per month average, making my clients quite happy and being able to support my wife and our two children. before starting freelancing i had been working for 8 years at a local publishing house where i got from an ordinary designer to a head of it dept serving 20+ daily&#x2f;monthly editions.<p>now i feel like i am ready to perform a next step in my life, in regard to my career. recently i have received a job offer from a company in stockholm doing a software as a service, for a position of a frontend developer. i had a talk via skype with a couple of representatives of the company and in the end they offered me to visit their office to have a detailed talk as they seem to be quite content with skill i have shown so far. surely they offer benefits, work permit visa and other things like a vacation, insurance.<p>i googled for average salaries for a position like mine there in stockholm as well as in other sweden cities. i have also found some more info about life there, costs, conditions, climate and so on. i know &#x27;average salary&#x27; doesn&#x27;t give much info about my specific potential salary i can get there. but at least i see the range and it&#x27;s quite different from my current income knowing that i will have to pay for an apartment, likely pay more for food and other things i don&#x27;t yet know about. on the other hand, may be it will be a good start for me to go networking, finding new opportunities, improving my skills.<p>so, please advise, what things i should consider while deciding? did you face similar choice when you were offered with a job while you were freelancing? how did you choose to accept or to reject a full time job? what are important factors for you? can it be a real move forward or more like a deadlock turning me into a small gear in a big mechanism? how can i setup my priorities properly not to say in a year or two i have had lost them?<p>i know many of the questions are subjective but i would like to hear from people who were in the same situation like mine.<p>thanks!	2013-10-21 08:04:47 UTC	48	66	3

431950	ask hn: using really simple history properly	i have implemented the rsh library for my website www.trailbehind.com.<p>this lets me change the hash of the url and store data when someone surfs around on my maps, so that i can provide links within the map and back button functionality.<p>however, i'm worried that google and the other search engines aren't going to take kindly to these links.<p>i realized that google wouldn't do things like index my page titles and other content, because they are generated when the dom is ready via javascript.<p>so, for now what i've done is maintain the hard links. for example, these two urls generate the same content:<p>1. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/#get_map_from_name/yosemite_national_park<p>2. http://cabin.trailbehind.com/park_map/yosemite_national_park/<p>i think the problem with this though is that if people link my site, they will end up linking the hash urls, while google will only check out the hard links. and thus, people blogging about me won't help my pagerank.<p>has anyone ever dealt with anything similar or have thoughts on this issue? google rankings are very important to trailbehind, and part of our strategy (which is already working) is getting listed for the long-tail of parks and forests.	2009-01-13 12:28:28 UTC	1	0	0

i submitted an app a couple weeks back which just recently got approved for a soft launch. after playing around with it on older devices we found a massive memory leak that severally effects stability and performance.<p>we quickly submitted a 1.1 version and contacted "appreview@apple.com". they said not to worry, and that it would be ready by sunday. fast forward to saturday and my 1.1 version says that it's still "pending an apple release". i've gotten nothing but radio silence after apple said they would have it ready by sunday. i show this puppy off in less then 24 hours in front of 3,000 people and i'm starting to sweat bullets.<p>i know that i'm grasping at straws here, but i don't know what else to do. if you guys could up vote this, maybe someone who knew what to do would see it, and be able to help me out of jam.<p>thanks hn community! i really appreciate it!<p>my email address is in my profile.	2010-11-20 17:09:54 UTC	107	34	0

2042898	ask hn: free online ebook + sell pdf/epub, or just sell pdf/epub ebook?	if you were writing a technology centric ebook, would you publish it free online and sell a digital ebook (pdf/epub/etc.) and print on demand version, or just have it for sell with a free sample chapter like most traditional publishers?  i'm noticing many online ebooks that are available fully free online but with for pay extras, http://railstutorial.org being a good example.  the free content would obviously be a great way for people to discover your writing, but also lowers the likelihood of them paying.  then again, a for-pay ebook that no one knows of won't get sold either.  most of all, there's no reason we need to stick with only the most traditional sales methods with ebooks.<p>what's your feelings about each method, and which would you choose?  i've almost decided what i want to do, but would be interested to see the general thoughts on both models.	2010-12-27 16:53:37 UTC	4	3	4

(info is in my profile)<p>also, what sites, or kinds of sites, would you like to see featured? i'll try to contact them and see if they're interested.	2010-10-25 19:20:37 UTC	3	0	4

363096	python+scipy+matplotlib vs matlab?	i'm learning datamining, machine learning, image processing etc by myself now but will start uni next year probably doing the same.<p>i tried octave briefly and wasn't that impressed. ok some neat functionality and easy matrix manipulation but pretty ugly and language isn't as nice as python. not sure about interoperability with other tools.<p>i already knew python so i naturally tried numpy+scipy+matplotlib and was literally blown away. so easy to use, really nice plotting capabilities and it is extremely convenient using a real and interactive programming language, especially when that language is python. being able to do everything with one tool is awesome.<p>i haven't tried matlab yet because it costs money. big minus right there obv especially since it is not exactly cheap.	2
it is also proprietary which is a another problem.	0
from what i have gathered it is an awesome tool though and there are huge amounts of matlab-code out there.<p>have any of you tried both? which do you prefer and why?	4
do you think scipy can take over?	0
python seem to be used everywhere in science; signal processing, chemistry, bioinformatics, nasa, google etc.<p>i have found a library for pretty much everything for scipy though. i mean having 10 different fft-libs isn't exactly much of a plus, one great one is enough.	1
so does matlab beat scipy on that point or not?	4
and is matlab much better than octave? different feel?	3
does matlab allow easy interaction with databases and other tools?	2008-11-13 15:02:24 UTC	73	44	0

442915	rfid tags enable mobile authentication platform	sports enthusiasts are often avid collectors of memorabilia, and some of the most highly valued sports collectibles are the uniforms and equipment worn or used by athletes in actual games. at sports collectibles shows and special fan events, fans can even get these items signed by the athletes who wore them, which adds significantly to their value. imagine the value of the helmet worn by eli manning in the super bowl, signed by the new york giants quarterback himself! but how do you — and appraisers or subsequent buyers — know that a helmet with manning's purported autograph is authentic? until recently, the purchaser of a signed collectible likely would have received a paper certificate of authenticity attesting to the validity of the item. but with such certificates, there was no way to definitively link them to specific merchandise items.	2009-01-21 06:56:02 UTC	1	-1	4

3784250	ask hn: admob practices	i have been using admob ads in both ways: inserted into my android app and to advertise the app itself.  after launching an update to my app, i wanted to run some ads again to drive traffic.  i had noticed that people would actually download the app after clicking to it before, and i had wanted to drive the downloads up to over 500 from the 350 it was at now.<p>one of the things i had done in the update was to remove ads from the free version of the app and to stop feature updates to the free version.  i was making no money on the ads ($1.47 in total) and as it was slowing down the loading of the screen, i decided to remove it altogether.<p>funnily enough, the new ads never got approved.  i suspect that this has to do with me removing the ads from the app and claiming as much in my "what's new" section, but of course i can't substantiate this.  all ads were copied from an older ad  that had successfully run and had itself been a copy of a previous one.  none of the new ads were run and no info was given to me.  the ads has at least 3 days notice (4 in one case).  the approval time is said to be a max of two days.<p>none of my emails seem to be registering on the admob site, and i can't get in touch with anyone.<p>does anyone have any recommendations or similar experiences with admob?  i have had no problems in the past, but now i am irritated that the ads did not run and there is no way for me to get a refund or to get in touch with anyone there at all.<p>any advice would be greatly appreciated.	2012-04-01 17:05:11 UTC	1	0	2

9465581	ask hn: does imperative programming have a (mainstream) future?	after this question getting down voted and put on hold on programmers.stackexchange.com, i decided to take it here, as hn seems to be better suited for discussion about such a topic.	2
copy of the question:<p>i have written a few small programs in python and c++ and am currently learning f# (i am already quite familiar with fp concepts, as a result of reading the learn you some haskell tutorial until the monad part ;) ). and while i appreciate the elegance of functional programming in some situations, in other situations i just feel that it would be more natural to write a particular algorithm imperatively with mutation and i certainly can&#x27;t imagine programming my arduino board in a functional way for example.<p>it often seems that today imperative programming is considered outdated and inferior to functional programming. so my question basically is: does imperative programming have a future outside of some niches? what do people with practical experience with both functional and imperative programming think? will the programming world slowly shift to functional programming languages or will functional programming languages merely continue to influence imperative programming languages, leading to tacked on fp features (like in the latest versions of java and c# and ruby, python etc.) or is functional programming in mainstream languages just a hype all together?	2015-04-30 15:18:51 UTC	5	10	2

4594542	ask hn: what's the best way to meet other developers to collaborate with?	i'm in the unfortunate (and sometimes fortunate) position of being a developer with a business background. the unfortunate part is that while my background (former strategy consultant, banker, and product manager) has given me a pretty solid "businessy" network, now that i mostly design/build stuff, i don't have as many developers in my network as i would like. what are some good ways to meet more likeminded developers who'd be interested in collaborating with me or building a business?<p>i have things that i want to build, but they're ambitious enough projects that i'd be hard pressed to build them on my own, not to mention my skillset is more front-end and design heavy (django/javascript/html/css etc) and i want to work with someone who has a stronger fundamental backend and data architecture skillset.<p>i've tried going to some meetups, but frankly they've been flops. it's like half seo experts and wordpress guys. no disrespect to them, but i'm looking for more of a hacker than that. i figure the most talented people are probably taken or busy doing their own thing. i don't want to be one of those stereotypical guys cold-emailing developers with "an amazing idea... all you have to do is build it". and i don't like the idea of outsourcing stuff on odesk.<p>any tips? are there online communities i can join for this kind of thing?<p>thanks in advance, everyone.	2012-09-30 23:04:43 UTC	4	3	3

the company i am working for is planning to release our cloud based software to the public.<p>all client interaction has happened via e-mail until now, which was ok, since we had only about 20 saas clients, plus a few dozen managed clients.<p>is there a "best-practices" for managing thousands of saas clients?<p>features would need are: customer support, ability to offer customized upsells, marketing to people whom we only have their e-mail addresses yet theyre not members, ability to attach billing info with our backend communications system.<p>after doing some research it seems like our solution will be something like: export user info into zendesk and salesforce by api.  zendesk for help, salesforce for upselling existing users (i think) and tracking billing/account info, and mailchimp for sending mass mails to existing users to non-users.<p>is there something that i am missing?	1
