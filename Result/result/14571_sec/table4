7758439	tell hn: system restore saved me	wow, major computer (win 7 lenovo laptop) problems, i haven’t had problems this significant in years.  it took 6 hours to resolve, 6 hours of my life i will never get back.
sometime in the early evening google chrome just started freezing and crashing anytime i clicked on a link from another website.  web sites i visit a lot seemed to load ok (cached?), but linking from them to other sites seemed to cause the issue.
i researched (on another computer), tried a solution, more research, more solutions.  disabling add-ons, virus and malware checks, etc.  it was also happening with ie, some of the solution attempts seem to fix ie, but certainly not chrome.  i even uninstalled and re-installed chrome to no avail.
i tried booting into safe mode to do some troubleshooting, and guess what, my computer got stuck in safe mode and would not boot back in normal mode.  i couldn&#x27;t connect to wifi.
what ultimately saved me (normal mode again) and fixed the chrome issue…system restore to 3 days ago…thanks to auto system backups!	2014-05-16 23:12:29 UTC		1	0	[]

7780540	net neutrality: what is it, and why we need it so very badly	by bob dorf
finally, there’s a slight wisp of sanity in the fcc’s view on the proposal to create a high-priced “fast lane” on the internet.  thursday’s new york times reports, “federal regulators appear to share one view about so-called net neutrality: it is a good thing.”  while the battle is far from over, for sure, it’s perhaps the first positive sign that there’s hope for startups.&lt;p&gt;why is net neutrality so important to startups? if cnn and disney, netflix and nbc can all pay comcast and verizon to “push” their content faster and ahead of companies without zillions, it puts any startup company at a severe, perhaps deadly disadvantage.  it’s classic “big money runs big government,” and as undemocratic as life can get.&lt;p&gt;roughly 60 days ago, on the world wide web’s 25th birthday(march 14 if you missed it) sir tim berners-lee, the inventor of “www,” cried out for “net neutrality,” without the prioritization that a recent federal court case suggested was totally ok. p&gt;remember january 2011, when egypt’s struggling government actually turned off the internet to stifle protests? or china’s choking internet pipes to stifle free speech?  yes, founders, this is far more toxic than slowdowns of monthly users or page views!&lt;p&gt;to understand “net neutrality” just type “avc.com” into your browser, where fred wilson shows us exactly what happens.&lt;p&gt;we’re clearly not out of the woods yet.  all that actually happened yesterday was the fcc’s agreeing to “open the debate.”  this will bring big gun lobbying pressure that maims startups(not to mention oppressed folks striving to be heard. their budgets are usually even smaller.)  as the times says, “before the plan becomes final, though, chairman tom wheeler, will need to convince his colleagues and an array of powerful lobbying groups that the plan follows the principle of net neutrality.”&lt;p&gt;

7682641	ask hn: advantages of browserify over require.js for spa development?	hello hacker news,&lt;p&gt;i have been working for quite some time with require.js on my frontend project, and enjoy a few points:
- the modular approach that allows lazy-loading parts of your application only when the user requests it
- taking advantage of the paths array to load from a cdn first, and fallback on a local resource if the former fails.
- its simplicity&lt;p&gt;however i particularly dislike the fact that development code and production code is different (as one goes through r.js), and i am not a particular fan of the syntax (common.js declarations looks actually simpler)&lt;p&gt;i have seen lately that people move over to browserify, and some say it represents the future of frontend development: i was wondering what people who did the move thought were real advantages for browserify over require.js.&lt;p&gt;disclaimer: let&#x27;s remember the context: code that goes to production, not small testing projects.&lt;p&gt;thanks for your inputs.	2014-05-01 20:56:09 UTC		1	0	[]

6826889	ssl without ca hack	# intro
to safe money and still have some security one can use following hack to use ssl without ca possibly hacked by nsa or others publicly paid but endorsing private interests.<p># how to
## 1) generate self-signed ssl certificate
for that you can use openssl or some other tool. check duck duck go or start page or evil google.<p>## 2) buy special domain name
use domain name in following format:
ssl-subj-key-id-$ssl_subj_key_id.com,
where $ssl_subj_key_id should be one of the ssl certificates parameters called subject key id or ski, which according to rfc3280 [1] is essentially sha1 hash of public-key of your cert.
it is necessary to divide hash using &#x27;-&#x27; into two strings to shorten the domain name.
### example
ssl-subj-key-id-a3b8cd018b99d899323-32659ac89d98bb8988d.com<p>## 3) inform your users
unfortunately not only the domain name is crazy long you also have to educate every non geek user how to check that the certificate is ok.
they have to be instructed to go to the details of obtained certificate and find the ski in the cert and then painfully check the hash with the domain name they got from you.
however if the source of the domain name is not vunerable to man in the middle then this method on the other hand increase little bit the security since this forces everyone to check the authenticity first time they visit the site.<p>## or later just buy signature of ca
and increase security even more.<p>## references
[1]  http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.ietf.org&#x2f;rfc&#x2f;rfc3280.txt<p># btw https:&#x2f;&#x2f;gnunet.org is gonna be big!

while 1 : sys.stdout.write( &quot;&#x2f;&quot; if int(random.random()+0.5) else &quot;\\&quot;)<p>pl&#x2f;sql - not really one line but possible - first time i&#x27;ve used put rather than put_line:
declare i number; begin for i in 1..10000 loop if round(dbms_random.value)=0 then dbms_output.put(&#x27;&#x2f;&#x27;); else dbms_output.put(&#x27;\&#x27;); end if; end loop; dbms_output.new_line; end;<p>haven&#x27;t done java yet!
lets see some variations in the languages you usually use.	2014-03-27 11:18:24 UTC		1	1	[]

2239658	ask hn: an idea for a dispersed library of alexandria	from wikipedia: the royal library of alexandria seems to have been the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world.<p>today:
i live in an area surrounded by many universities and students. i have a ton of books at home and i am sure so do the others around me. but i don't know what books they have and they don't know what i have. it is hard to share books and it would be great to be able to share them and get to know people who have the same reading interests as you...<p>solution:
people can upload the titles of their books and create an account with a zip-code. with the zip-code when people search for a book they can see who closest to them has the book that they need. they can request to borrow it etc.<p>tweak 1:
getting people to upload a list of their books can be tricky. one solution would be for them to take a high-res photo of their bookshelves and using ocr to identify the books. i did a mock trial on my bookshelf and it worked ok<p>tweak 2:
search results could be anonymous. you could request it and the person you requested the book from you could see who you were and decide if they wanted to share with you.<p>would love to hear if people think that something like this would work? if people would want this? have you wished that sharing books was easier?	2011-02-19 19:16:26 UTC		1	2	[]

3559080	ask hn: what would you do?	i'm a (first semester) junior studying computer science. i took last semester off to work with lift (funded by &#38; partners with the obvious corporation), and that was an amazing experience. i figured since i was halfway done with school and this much invested, that i would return back and finish up my degree.<p>and then i started taking calc ii.<p>i've been to tutoring 3 times/week for the last 2 weeks, worked through more than the assigned homework questions, and visited my prof for help, but i'm just not getting it. by not getting it, i mean i failed the first two quizzes and recently got below a 40% on our first test.<p>unfortunately, this is the 4th to last math class i'd have to take if i wanted to get my degree in cs. so, i've been thinking about changing to entrepreneurship with a minor in cs, or re-taking calc i this summer to prepare me more for calc ii (although that would push back my graduation date... and cost much more).<p>i'm interested in hearing if any of you have had similar experiences, or any thoughts on how i should go about this?<p>i ask because what got me the job with lift (and a job this summer with rdio) were my side projects. with how heavily math-based our cs curriculum is, i'm worried i won't have any time to put into side projects and still get above a c- ("passing grade") in all of my classes.<p>i would appreciate any help whatsoever - thoughts, comments, concerns, etc. my contact info is in my profile, but i'd love a discussion to be started here, so others that may be going through the same thing can learn from this as well.<p>thanks, hn.	2012-02-06 20:38:23 UTC		1	3	[]

2971204	ask hn: validate idea - twitter client that filters your stream	hello hn,<p>help me decide about my product idea. i'd like to make a twitter client that is able to do two things:<p>- filter stream noise "i waked, i ate" etc based on ml methods<p>- show you most popular discussions that your followed people are carrying (by means of my super secret algorithm), popular discussions based on topic etc. that you normally loose in a sea of noise<p>- maybe even organize your tweeted links under some taxonomy, or the tweets themselves, make graphs about what you tweet, etc.<p>are these ideas on par with twitter client development laws? should it better be a plugin to a popular client (which?, i never used any!)? would you find it useful? how should i monetize it? should i make it a web service? anyone doing the same? are these things profitable?  can twitter cut my string afterwards?	2011-09-07 20:13:06 UTC		2	2	[]

1383894	ask hn: how do i sell some code that i wrote	a few years ago i quit my day job and started using my savings to build a product mostly aimed at companies. for some reason or another i had to stop doing that after only managing a (minor) sell.<p>i still have all the source for the product, and over the years i'm always thinking of getting back to it, but for one reason or other i have never done it. this piece of code works very good, but the web frontend needs some work to expose all the info of the backend and some cosmetics changes.<p>so my question is: how could i go to find someone interested in buying this code ?<p>there are a few companies already in this market space so i know there's a need for this sort of product, and my code could be used to maybe add extra capabilities to an existing product.	2010-05-27 15:24:50 UTC		2	2	[]

4794208	how i got 300+ hn points posting a 5yo+ link that made the front page for 20hrs	i thought i'd share my story about the link i posted the other day, free vms of windows to test older versions of ie (microsoft.com).  i never realized this link would be worth 300+ hacker news points, but i thought the story around it might be interesting enough to share.<p>i was working on a client site that required the use of ie 7 to test a particular bug. i had installed virtualbox in the past, but after doing a fresh install of os x i was trying to avoid that whole process.  in fact i was even considering installing the old, old version of ie 5.5 that was actually released for the mac platform back in the stone age.  so i went to google and searched for "ie os x" and found this: 
http://samvermette.com/256.  this was the first i heard of microsoft releasing free vms so i thought, "hey cool, i'll share this on twitter".  i posted the link, @stroughtonsmith retweeted it and before i knew it i had retweets and stars coming in at a consistent clip.<p>through the retweets came a single mention pointing me over to https://github.com/xdissent/ievms which was quite useful for my case.  knowing the original article was published in june of 2011 i knew this wasn't new information, but i figured i'd post the link to hn anyway. i figured somebody had to have posted it in the past, so i might get a duplicate link error or something.<p>well that didn't happen and immediately it started to get points and comments, very helpful comments at that.  i chimed in a few times in the beginning and got bonus points for a couple of my early comments.<p>so a few things i learned from this: hn doesn't necessarily reward new, cutting edge information, chiming in early to a trending topic is worth a fair number of comment points, and you learn a lot more about a topic than you do posting a link to twitter.  finally i found hn points aren't worth anything toward my profile.  i got absolutely zero visitors to my website and i doubt anybody even clicked over to my profile to see who i am.	2012-11-16 15:40:13 UTC		2	3	[]

3371245	ask hn: coffeescript used in open-source javascript libraries?	there is a high likelihood that this question my erupt in a flamewar, but it's not intended to, so if you do choose to participate, please try to keep it civil.<p>so far, we've seen several arguments for and against coffeescript:<p>https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2011/12/jargon.md#readme<p>http://www.codethinked.com/a-case-for-using-coffeescript<p>http://userinexperience.com/?p=732<p>etc.<p>from my experience and all the arguments presented by both sides, cs appears to be an excellent tool when put in the right hands and used in a well set up development environment that has been tailored for coding in coffeescript.<p>the choice to use coffeescript or not appears to be as much a religious war as emacs vs. vim. most arguments boil down to taste, and in some cases the social contract regarding tools that you've established with your team.<p>the question i have is if coffeescript in open-source 
javascript libraries is a net positive or net negative for javascript. i can see arguments for both sides, but if the stakes aren't discussed i can see a potential tragedy of the commons where there are increasingly two versions of every javascript library, the one written in javascript that receives few contributions from those who spend most of their time in coffeescript and those written in coffeescript that receive few contributions from those who don't use coffeescript and haven't tooled their environment to work effectively with it.<p>despite the contentiousness of this issue, i'm curious to hear what others think.<p>please leave your personal preferences at home (your dev env) and try to only discuss the pros and cons of coffeescript being used in open-source libraries and the impact is has on our community.<p>social issues, community issues and language evolutions are fair game. discussions of syntax preference should be avoided.	2011-12-19 21:36:43 UTC		3	2	[]

292958	ask hn: do you have a business plan?	i know, i know, we're all supposed to be agile, iterative startuppers, building something quick, and then being flexible enough to recognize and capitalize on every opportunity that presents itself...<p>pg says<p><pre><code>  "don't worry about making money. making something people like is much harder". 
</code></pre>
dhh says<p><pre><code>  "ask yourself: how can i build something that i can charge money for?". 
</code></pre>
neither suggests a formal business plan, as far as i can tell. i know everyone here has at least a vague idea of <i>how they might</i> be able to make money. but does anyone here, who hasn't launched yet, have a written business plan?	2008-09-02 18:25:26 UTC		4	2	[]

10138120	ask hn: native development proxy for mac	when developing api-heavy apps i am using a mix of charles proxy and burp suite to listen on and manipulate http calls. both do the job very well and are really powerful in my opinion. while not missing anything feature-wise both are java-based and seem to negatively affect my system stability, are rather slow and quite resource hogs even on my reasonably powerful machine. i tried to find some native implementation that would let me listen on http from e.g the browser, simulator and devices, let me throttle the connection and manipulate requests &#x2f; responses but did not have any success. is anyone here aware of an app that roughly does what i outlined while being not java based? price is not so much an issue.	2015-08-28 22:11:48 UTC		4	4	[]

4775653	ask hn: good places to learn ui/ux?	hi hn! long time lurker, first time poster.
i'm a 22-year-old in the greater boston area, slowly working my way through college.
i'm trying to build some sort of ui/ux degree, or, as i've recently taken to calling it, human interface design. i want to approach the subject from multiple angles at once: from a coding perspective, as a designer, and with respect to the psychology of perception and interactions. i'm genuinely very interested in this.
unfortunately, the university where i'm currently enrolled doesn't have anything like that, so i'm forced to look elsewhere for help.<p>really, i suspect that the best thing for me might be to find an internship where i could observe and maybe even assist someone doing this sort of work. i have some (limited) experience coding (java, js, html, etc.) and doing design, and i've been working at a smallish startup for almost the last year, essentially doing whatever needs doing, so i'm comfortable with that culture, as well.<p>my questions for you:
what're the best resources, online or otherwise, to learn about interface design?
what's the best <i>way</i> to learn? do i build this major? find one elsewhere (at another school, for instance)? self-teach? etc.<p>thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for your help!<p>tl;dr need help figuring out how best to learn how to be a ui/ux designer.	2012-11-13 00:50:27 UTC		8	3	[]

2558387	show hn: how hn helped us pay for our wedding.	so my fiance and i are addicted to hacker news and we have learned a lot about startups on here. we had an idea for a startup that would have taken a lot of time and resources to build but thanks to hacker news we have learned about people like eric ries, steven blank and the whole customer development strategy.<p>we decided to build the mvp for our startup to see if there was a market for our original idea and also raise money for our wedding. we shaved off all of the crazy features and launched https://www.crowdbundle.com/<p>hacker news taught us to build a mvp and make sure there was a market first: by getting people to make purchases so far we have been able to validate that we are providing something of value and the right people are being targeted.<p>we learned you need to charge money from day one when you are bootstrapping. this was an easy decision because we want to know if we are providing something of value to the right people. if people are willing to actually take out the credit card and pay us for something then we can measure how valuable they find our product.<p>we learned about social hooks for making a product or service go viral. we all know push marketing is not very effective but personal recommendations are. that is why we have integrated twitter and facebook into the checkout process. if someone is willing to let us tweet or update the facebook wall on their behalf to show a personal recommendation for our product we now have personal recommendations towards their friends. to promote this activity we built a system that gives major discounts for such behavior.<p>if anyone has any other suggestions to help validate our mvp please let use know. :-)	2011-05-17 23:18:34 UTC		8	12	[]

6505170	ask hn: landed my first freelance job, how should i price the project?	i recently landed my first freelance job based off a little side project that i had on github.  i&#x27;m not a professional developer, i just do this as a hobby in my free time.  it&#x27;s serendipitous that i have a few months off between jobs and i&#x27;d like to make sure i don&#x27;t make a rookie mistake in pricing this job and setting up the contract.<p>the work is machine learning algorithm development and then integrating the solution into the client&#x27;s existing infrastructure.<p>a few questions:<p>* what are the pros&#x2f;cons of an hourly rate vs. fixed price?<p>* anything to watch out for in how the contract is structured?  e.g., provisions about intellectual property, dealing with changes in requirements, or spelling out what deliverables are required?<p>* what kind of padding factor do you apply to your estimates of hours to complete a feature?<p>based on some other things that i&#x27;ve read, i&#x27;m leaning towards pitching an hourly rate with an upper limit.  for example, quoting a high-end price of $x and charging by the hour, giving them the savings if i can implement it in fewer hours or (hopefully not) having to renegotiate if it&#x27;s significantly more complicated than i envision.<p>any advice would be appreciated.  if someone has a boilerplate contract that has worked well for them in the past, i&#x27;d love to see it.  thanks hn!	2013-10-06 19:41:59 UTC		11	8	[]

a little over 5 months ago, i left my job at motionbox.com. motionbox ended up getting bought by snapfish who had no interest in keeping any of the pro users (people hosting commercial content). so, in order to not screw over those customers, and to make a bit of money, i decided to build a comparable service and migrate over all of the users. we just started migrating users on last monday and things seem to be going well. we have about 150 users as of today.<p>so, if any of you need cheap commercial video hosting, you know where to go!	2010-08-09 20:41:47 UTC		15	6	[]

1883608	an open letter to apple computer, inc.	apple computer, inc.,<p>i have watched, with a certain amount of surprise and agreement, as the nerd elite have rallied in response to your announcement of the mac app store. i will summarize their concerns here, for your benefit: first, if you ever decide to distribute software <i>solely</i> through the mac app store for apple computers, independent software producers will not have an easy way to distribute their software on their own terms. second, a lot of software licensing requires that it be redistributable, but if the only way to load software onto a machine is through a third party, that licensing is not satisfied even when the software is free of charge.<p>that's it. that's the whole reason that people are upset. other people can talk about various other issues with your approval process, but they would frankly get over it if there was an assurance that it will always remain as easy as it currently is to install software on a mac outside of the app store channel.<p>to be honest, your assurance would probably not mean very much. apple made it very clear that they would never make a netbook, and now we have the new macbook air, which absolutely meets the requirements to be described as such. this is but the last in a long string of what i will generously call misdirections.<p>i have a solution which will, however, satisfy the nerds and make them happier than you have likely considered possible. it's a solution that will lessen the load of your approval team, not cut into your revenue streams, and lower your bandwidth and infrastructure costs. i'm asking you to harness the power of open standards and the internet, something that you have spoken in favor of a number of times, but in a slightly different light.<p>open your app store protocol. allow people to host their own app store servers. provide a single, buried configuration dialog that allows people to add the urls of these servers. don't even worry about payment, because the nerds want to distribute their software for free. when you have done this, you win.<p>of course, it would mean one more dialog, one that would likely be very confusing to some of your users. but then, i might consider buying another mac or 50 over the course of my life, and i am fairly confident that there are others who feel the same way. please don't underestimate how many of your customers care about their computers.<p>thanks very much for your time,<p>chris rhoden	2010-11-08 19:23:41 UTC		22	23	[]

1761010	ask hn: what are the necessary skills for the "business person"?	i have been mentoring several startups recently, and helping people build their prototypes/betas. i want to put together a more formal program to help recent grads get their first startup off the ground. i have a laundry list of things that a programmer needs to know how to do, but i am coming up short on the exact skills needed by the business guy/gal. from my personal experience there is no shortage of things that they could/should be working on, but i am not sure what the most critical things that someone coming out of a business program would need to learn to operate in a beneficial manner in a startup.<p>just to clarify, i don't believe the business person in a startup should ever think of themselves as the boss, or the idea person, etc. eventually they may grow in to a ceo / captain of the ship type role, but initially they need to focus on very practical things such as finding customers, getting feedback, potentially pitching to investors. even more practically perhaps they should be answering customer emails, doing the bookkeeping, etc?<p>i would love to get a list of the actual skills and day to day things that someone who is not a programmer can be doing to help a tech startup get off the ground.<p>thank you!	2010-10-05 19:17:16 UTC		24	15	[]

633873	ask hn: is twitter lost on me?	hi all,<p>i do not want to burst the twitter love-fest bubble but am i the only one who feels twitter is aimed at a pretty narrow demographic?<p>this demographic i would split into two:
1. people who have a lot of time on their hands to read tweets or add their own. for me this means mostly students and those between/without jobs.<p>2. companies/individuals trying to link themselves with this hot new trend for profit, monetary or otherwise. a win-win situation develops as twitter's success can drive people to a company/individual and the company/individual will drive people to twitter.<p>why this post i hear you mumble?<p>for me personally, i do not fall into the above demographic. i have a full-time job which takes up all of my focus/attention during the day. i do not have time or feel compelled to check a website/twitter client constantly to read new tweets or post myself. and, to be honest, i already have plenty of things to read/do when my mind does need a wonder in the evening/weekend (yes hn et al, i am looking at you).<p>are there others out there like me?	2009-05-30 17:25:30 UTC		38	44	[]

2100342	ask hn: please give us feedback on our (anti-social) tool thinkery.me	alex and i built this tool (http://thinkery.me) because we were unhappy with existing apps like evernote, delicious, historio.us, pinboard.in or other software on the market. every tool we examined needed too much work to organize your stuff or does only one thing.<p>we wanted an app that extends your brain by:<p>- making it super fast to add new things, urls, todos, just throwing everything at it that is in your brain<p>- automatically extracting relevant content like text, audio, video, images (using oembed but also scraping the page identifying the relevant content)<p>- quickly finding your notes with instant-search<p>- keeping things private or making them public (to share them on twitter, facebook)...<p>my public things: http://thinkery.me/nader<p>example of extracted page (truncated due to copyright reasons, private things dont get truncated): http://thinkery.me/nader/4d2ec7f67477595c14000000<p>example of oembed content: http://thinkery.me/nader/4d245b10747759f448010000<p>we're not perfectly sure what direction to take. what we're sure of is that this needs a working mobile version but for the rest...would you rather focus on making the app more social or add features like:<p>- assigning things to / inviting other people (@-syntax?)?<p>- dragging'n'dropping of images into it?<p>- create filters so you can only display private / public things?<p>- extracting even more content by aggregating similar things?<p>- automatically retrieve tweets you favorited?<p>it would be awesome and very much appreciated if you gave your thoughts, feedback or posted any bugs you encounter. also say if this is a tool you would use or what is missing so you would use it.<p>looking forward to it!<p>ps: there is a delicious importer in case you want to try that out: http://thinkery.me/delicious.php	2011-01-13 16:37:19 UTC		49	34	[]

1994608	leaning tower of padre island, texas (real estate disaster)	this should be the poster-child for what went wrong with housing in the last few years:<p>$125m for a tower built on a beach undergoing erosion. after the building started leaning noticeable and settling unevenly, the developers decided it cheaper to just demolish than try to fix it. (cost to fix: upwards $25m and the bank was unwilling to fund it anymore)<p>a video of the demolition: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlce2n54b9s<p>the ironic thing was that the body of the building were very solidly built with great excess of rebar. the central columns were almost solid lengths of rebar with a little concrete thrown in. if they had only built the foundation strong enough as the rest, that thing could have stood solid in a mega hurricane.<p>an article about the subsequent cleanup job (the only thing that went well in this affair): http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/14222144-1.html<p>and what it should have been:

8394211	ask hn: help becoming a one-man 'micropreneur'	i&#x27;m a recovering freelancer that recently picked up &quot;start small, stay small&quot;* from a thread here on hn and it really resonated with me.<p>i have been freelancing very informally over the last few years but i find myself totally unable to progress. my contract work has fizzled out and i haven&#x27;t been able to get the energy or passion together to replace it with more. i&#x27;ve gone through numerous cycles of trying to love freelancing followed by total burnout &amp; disillusionment. put simply, i feel like i&#x27;m stagnating.<p>i&#x27;m a good all-round web developer and communicator so i would like to draw on this and work on my own stuff. i love the freedom of freelancing and i can&#x27;t see myself working for somebody else (nor would my cv allow for it at this stage). due to unfortunate family circumstance i&#x27;m living back in the family home which gives me the opportunity to try things while still living rent-free so i&#x27;d like to grasp that.<p>i&#x27;m sure there are many others here on hn that are making their living via their own software so i&#x27;d love to get some advice and resources to help get me motivated and broken-in?<p>- for those who didn&#x27;t have breakaway successes upfront, how did you get started and, in particular, motivated?<p>- how did you generate ideas and then focus on them?<p>- how did you fail? what ideas didn&#x27;t work and how many of them did you have?<p>- what resources did you use? lectures, classes, sites, books, blogs etc.?<p>* http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.startupbook.net&#x2f;	2014-10-01 13:41:45 UTC		1	0	[]

3630902	ask hn: how to build a better how-to site	hello hacker news, big fans of you guys and ycombinator, of course. i would like the help of the community on a project i'm starting... still at the beginning, but will keep you posted with the progress.<p>i'm building a how-to website in croatia. there's very little competition in this space and a lot of demand by searchers for these kind of articles, so i figure that starting a professional site is ideal.<p>i already have essentially "howto.com" in my language, so domain naming is not a problem.<p>here are my plans for the website:
- hire a hick-ass design firm and spend 5-10k to have something sexier than ehow or wikihow today
- pay freelancers u$3-5 (a lot more here than in the us) to write articles that have more than 1k searches in google or that users ask us to (what's the fastest way to do this?)
- have edit buttons on every page so that user can add content (it will have to be approved by us initially)
- do standard seo stuff and build profiles in major social networks, spending some money to build up facebook page<p>i want help on ideas to build the best (and most profitable, obviously) how-to website in my country.<p>should i buy out my competition, transfer their articles to my website and increase their pageviews by my better domain, seo, design and marketing?<p>do you think i need angels like yc to mentor and invest, or should i just put my money (like 50k) and run my site myself?<p>ehow/wikihow/etc. readers and users, what major flaws do you see on the website? how can i make my site better?<p>i appreciate the feedback. thanks a bunch,

3076009	sr. web application engineer opportunity	centro's technology team is building web applications for streamlining digital media planning. our apps are built with sproutcore, ruby, rails and postgres, but you don't have to be an expert in those to come work for us: we're looking for talented developers and designers with experience building great web applications in any language. extra credit for lisp or smalltalk experience, as we find these languages correlate with the type of folks we enjoy talking to.<p>centro is the #1 company on crain's 2011 "best places to work in chicago" list, and for good reason: developers get an annual training budget to allocate as they see fit on conferences, classes, books or anything else they can talk their manager into. fridays are "build something cool" days, where you can go off-sprint and work on whatever you think makes our products, processes, or development environment better.	2011-10-05 15:21:28 UTC	http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?bj=o5rSVfw3&s=Reddit	1	0	[]

1349078	ask hn: a good reference to ms office automation, please	hello! i know that the web is littered with questions on this matter, but i still haven't been able to apply the answers i can find to my situation. i hence kindly beseech hners to share your wisdom on this rather outdated issue.<p>i realize there is vba, but i always disliked having the program/macro living inside the (say) excel file, with the resulting bloat, security warnings, etc. i'm thinking along the lines of a vbscript that works on a set of excel files while leaving them macro-free. now, i've been able to "paint the first column blue" for all files in a directory following this approach, but i need to do more complex operations (charts, pivot tables, etc.), which could greatly benefit from the additional tools found in vba.<p>for this specific example knowing how to remove all macros from all files after processing would be enough, but all suggestions are welcome. any good references? (+) any advice on how to best approach <i>external</i> batch processing of excel files and its office cousins?<p>thanks!<p>(+) even if the reference is, "ask in this other website: _____."	2010-05-15 00:59:09 UTC		1	1	[]

3565256	askhn: is there a way to defeat snail mail?	background info: ---<p>i have been wanting to move away from snail mail correspondence. i do e-bills whenever i can, opt for electronic w2s etc. i detest snail mail, its a waste of paper, it makes things messy, and it takes up tons of actual space/time etc sorting thru and keeping records.<p>i also travel a lot, so often, i will return home to find a bunch of mail in my mailbox, which will likely take up precious time i could be spending on more pleasurable tasks such as hitting my head on the wall.  as "every problem is an opportunity", i figured out a solution.<p>at first, i wanted to have a wifi enabled mailbox with a built-in scanner, so the mailman would have to insert standard size envelopes into a slot which would then open that piece of mail and scan the letter, upload the document to the web and shred the paper version.  my lil way of fighting the "mail" establishment.  after some searching, i come to the conclusion that, i have neither the time, money or mechanical engineering expertise to build such a device.  (although. if you're a gifted mech-e and can build such a system, i'm all ears).  i did a little google search of "smart" mailboxes, and the "smartest" solution i found was a how-to article on life hacker, which alerted you on your iphone when you mailbox at home was opened.  i still needed a better solution.   i keep getting dinged by insurance companies and all those evil snail mail sending entities because i don't go thru my paper mail every day (or week, or month for that fact), so i desperately need a solution.<p>back on earth, i seem to find a solution that's bound to work.  i asked someone to bring my mail in periodically, open them and scan them on a scanner which is in the kitchen in my absence.  i figured it shouldn't be too hard to find a relatively "smart", wi-fi enabled,  all-in-one printer which can directly upload to the web (e.x. to google docs or shoeboxed).  i spend hours looking for the right device, and i finally get an hp 7510, which is supposed to support hp's new "printapps" concept and per their website, scanning directly to google docs from this printer should be a breeze.  alas, upon getting the printer, i realize that the google docs application isn't really there in their "app market".  all the available apps generated more useless paper artifacts which would only add to my mail clutter.<p>i just spent over an hour on the phone with hp, to see if they could tell me whether apps are for specific printer types or not.  only problem is that their customer service/tech support is worse than the half assed device i ended up buying.<p>it all seems so stupid to me.  i mean, heck it's not rocket science. wifi enabled devices such as this should at least be able to send scanned data to the web.  it's absolutely something hp can support, but i get the feeling that they're choosing not to.  if people are all about digital documents, they may be afraid that they'll loose printer customers.  so, they include these "shitty"  print apps, whose main purpose seems to be to generate more useless paper.  i'm so frustrated that something like this doesn't always exist.  it's 2012 for cryin out loud, we should've been able to do this since the advent of wifi.  it seemed doxie go wifi would be capable of handling the task.  but by now, i've had it up to my eyeballs.<p>question(s):
--------<p>does anyone know how to hack the new hps, so that i can put my own, more useful software on it, which lets it communicate with and upload directly to the cloud?  at this point i'm really frustrated, i could buy other scanners which also boast this technology, but i don't want to go thru hell to set it up.  anyone work one of these hp apps?  i would also deeply appreciate any advise you can give on how to tackle this situation.  shouldn't something like this be already exist?	2012-02-08 05:38:17 UTC		1	2	[]

3445350	ask hn: where do you find data on a market's size w/o spending a fortune?	i'm working on my startup and pitch. one challenge i have is finding trusted reports on the size of the market that i want to sell into. in my case, it's law enforcement technology. i've researched different analysts, but they charge thousands for their reports, and i'm not even sure if their report really has the data that i need.<p>any suggestions on how to find this type of data for a reasonable cost? i'm not looking for minutia, but a breakdown of spending trends by municipalities and the federal government would be a decent start. i suppose this should all be public data, but that doesn't mean its any easier to coalesce.	2012-01-10 02:25:23 UTC		2	0	[]

5094590	what really caused aaron swartz's suicide?	i'm surprised that nobody has talked about what really caused aaron swartz's suicide. i don't want to play armchair psychologist here (i'm not a psychologist first of all, and i have never met or talked to aaron). nevertheless, there are some possibilities that, despite extensive discussions on hn, have not yet been voiced.<p>first of all, it's clear that while the lawsuit against aaron aggravated the stress he was feeling (a completely normal reaction), the lawsuit by itself should not have caused such an extreme reaction. there are many people in the world who face such situations (and much worse), and while incredibly stressed, the vast majority of those individuals do not kill themselves.<p>we can also see from aaron's blog entries, going way back, that he had been suffering from episodes of severe depression for years. he had even talked about suicide in some of those blog posts. whatever aaron had been wrestling with, it was already there before the lawsuit happened.<p>reading his blog posts, watching his interviews, and listening to people who knew him well, what emerges is a person who was incredibly driven to fight... for something. it seems like that everything in his life was a gigantic struggle. the details don't matter as much. the spread of free information on the internet, while a noble cause, in my opinion was simply the fight that aaron's spirit landed on. if aaron had not been involved with computers it would have been something else. where did this fighting and struggling come from? could it be a symbolic expression of a huge amount of anger?<p>i also found it curious that aaron had been so driven to achieve and prove himself from such an early age. i read that at the tender age of 14 he was already out in the world interacting with people much older than him. there are a couple ways to look at that. one is to be impressed by his precociousness. the other is to ask -- why the hell was he doing that? there's nothing wrong with achievement. but why wasn't he being allowed to be a regular kid as well?<p>another thing i found curious is that in all his blog posts about his struggles with various psychological and physical problems, he never mentioned anything about a support system. he seemed to be quite lonely with his troubles. some of his friends wrote in their own blog posts after his death that he often rejected them and would isolate himself for months on end. again, where did he learn to do that? where was his natural support system? people who grow up with a lot of support and caring around them would not be struggling alone with such demons.<p>the reaction from his family struck me as very odd as well. first, it was his uncle who confirmed his death, nobody from his immediate family. and the only statements we heard from his father were angry statements that tried to blame the government for his son's death. his father's statements contained only anger. not even compassion for his son.<p>i think that the key to aaron's inner psyche is probably somewhere in aaron's past. this is someone who was incredibly hurt at some point in time, and he was never able to come to terms with that. he probably wasn't even aware of it.<p>aaron strikes me as someone who was abandoned very early on, left to struggle for himself. where were his parents through all this time? the most important lessons to be learned from this have nothing to do with prosecutors, mit, jstor, or attorney generals. it has everything to do with aaron's abandonment. if anyone should be doing soul searching it should be his parents.	2013-01-22 00:05:48 UTC		2	1	[]

2265472	ask hn: torn between product and by-product. what to do?	we've been rather busy since early 2010 working on a technology (project) requiring significant amounts of r&#38;d effort.<p>of late, it reached a (<i>very interesting</i>) stage where it started spinning-off small (and some not-so-small) by-products, like there's no tomorrow!<p>(those who're interested can seen some of the by-products below:<p>http://www.rapidefs.com<p>http://iploc.info and http://iploc.info/api)<p>a recent off-shoot of this work <i>gifted</i> us with an idea the commercial potential (and the whoa! or golly! factor) of which can easily make the primary project pale into insignificance.<p>if we move forward with this (the latest by-product), we'd almost certainly have to sort of ditch the original one or, at least, put it on a back burner for a long/ish time.<p>as the sole owner of the company, i have pretty much a totally free hand in making decisions but i'm not really able to make up my mind on this one.<p>i'm turning to you all for your opinions/suggestions. what would <i>you</i> do in a similar situation? please let me know.<p>ps. i've not mentioned specifics of either project for the sake of brevity. if you need more info in order to opine, please ask. :-)	2011-02-26 13:23:14 UTC		2	9	[]

8920194	re: yesterdays post on cli tools being near 100x faster than dedicated systems	i built sentences from &#x2f;usr&#x2f;share&#x2f;dict with a small one line script i made.<p>i have as `final_data` as a source file with a bunch of strange sentences in it.<p>$cat final_data | wc -l
	 1501920<p>so, a little more than 1.5v million &quot;records&quot; in the file.<p>and let&#x27;s time the operation:
	$time cat final_data | wc -l
	 1501920<p>real	0m0.063s
	user	0m0.052s
	sys	0m0.043s<p>thats some speedy stuff.  keep in mind, i am running this on a mac os x yosemite macbookpro (15-inch, mid <i>2010</i>), 8 gb (self upgraded from 4gb) 1067 mhz ddr3, 2.53 ghz intel core i5, so by no means at all a speed demon.  there probably literally are now faster phones on the market.<p>i imagine, were i to drop two ssd&#x27;s in here the second in the cd tray slot and worked the source and destination data from each drive so they are never combating for read and write access, this would be sped up a ton.  or i had a ssd array.<p>next up, lets drop off the cat and work right away with the `wc` application.  if sure get blazingly faster:<p>$time wc -l final_data 
	 1501920 final_data<p>real	0m0.059s
	user	0m0.044s
	sys	0m0.015s<p>faster in every regard.  just for fun, lets pump a grep call in there and see how much it speeds up, slows down, who knows:<p>* remember to clear your terminal scroll back when looking at large data like this, or set the threshold to a lower value. until i did, mac is x does not like multi-megabyte text files.<p>wow, that was significantly faster than i thought:<p>$time grep &#x27;\.&#x27; final_data | wc -l	
	  1501920<p>real	0m0.705s
	user	0m0.712s
	sys	0m0.035s<p>and, lets do it how some things sometimes happen, but they are just one off&#x27;s:<p>$time cat final_data | grep &#x27;\.&#x27; final_data | wc -l 
	  1501920<p>real	0m0.766s

1873992	ask hn: feedback/advice on an ec2 based startup	i am hoping to get some input for the minds here at hn. my startup can be found at: http://labslice.com. it's a solution that allows you to use ec2 for the distribution of thick or thin client applications to customers (ie. send your customer a hyperlink, and it will automatically launch a fully accessible vm for them on a timed-lease). the idea can be extended to anything where sharing of vms is desirable: training environments, test and lab systems etc.<p>one problem i face is that i currently require a user's aws access keys (web service keys) to be able to manage their environment. this tends to confuse people at sign-up. i'm wondering if it's a smart or risky idea to give short term trials using my own ec2 aws environment, or if i should focus solely on those who already know a lot about ec2.<p>thanks. se.	2010-11-05 17:17:06 UTC		3	3	[]

1700357	ask hn: mentors and mentoring	i'm just starting out on a project on my own but in an area i have little knowledge of. so having a mentor would help me tremendously in navigating the treacherous waters of getting an independent project off the ground and achieving some measure of success.<p>however, i'm not sure of the protocols of taking up a mentor and the entire mentoring process. what is it that the mentors hope to achieve in return? is it the satisfaction of teaching the ropes to a newbie, some form of monetary compensation or perhaps some amount of stake in the venture/project should it succeed?<p>edit: also pointers to how the mentoring process works would be really helpful. i.e. how does the interaction take place, to what extent should one rely on the mentor and even follow the advice when viewpoints differ on say a particular point.	2010-09-17 06:57:53 UTC		3	4	[]

8605554	godaddy forwarding service failure case	i&#x27;ve recently run into an issue with godaddy in which i&#x27;d like to share with the community so that others don&#x27;t share the same experience.
we have a setup that consists of a domain hosted on godaddy in which we have forwarding to a www subdomain which is a cname that points to another domain.
so it&#x27;s like this foobar.com forwards to www.foobar.com and www.foobar.com points to baz.com via a cname.
if a url exists such as foobar.com&#x2f;some%3aelse godaddy will fail in forwarding it and respond with... &lt; http&#x2f;1.1 302 found &lt; cache-control: max-age=900 &lt; location: &#x2f;site.aspx?aspxerrorpath=&#x2f;some:else
after numerous calls to godaddy tier 1 and tier 2 tech support they have come to the conclusion that it can&#x27;t be fixed and that we should look elsewhere for a service that fulfills our needs.
this is a very common setup for aws elasticbeanstalk installations so i&#x27;m just giving a warning to the community in case anybody runs into this issue.	2014-11-14 02:34:36 UTC		4	0	[]

5445254	ask hn: how can i read old blogs?  what happens when google reader shuts down?	i'm interested in finding a convenient way to read through the old archives of a blog, especially when the blog's website may no longer exist.  this introduces a number of issues, especially in light of the upcoming google reader shutdown.<p>1. how can one reliably compile a feed for an old blog's archive, since the normal rss feed only contains the last 10 or 20 posts?  (see [1] for an old buggy solution using google reader.)<p>2. the internet archive should maintain most of the information somewhere, in principle, right?  will the accessibility of old blogs take a large hit when google reader shuts down?<p>3. how can i read through old blog posts in a nice way that allows me to check off what i've read, mark good posts, and browse more easily than by slowly-loading pages which show all the posts in a month?  (see [2] and [3] for inconclusive discussion on the web apps stack exchange. note: i asked [3] in 2010.)<p>in my utopia, all closed blogs are eternally associated with a unique rss or atom feed that can be dropped into a reader, allowing the user to browse it just like a current blog.  closed blogs are like books, and recommending a closed blog to a friend is as easy as giving them the relevent rss feed.<p>does this already exist?<p>[1] http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/06/reconstruct-feeds-history-using-google.html<p>[2] http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/5810/how-can-i-re-read-an-rss-feed-from-the-beginning<p>[3] http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/6194/whats-the-best-way-to-read-through-the-archives-of-a-blog	2013-03-26 18:46:43 UTC		4	0	[]

7986133	show hn: curv - a wearable camera	this is a hardware project that i&#x27;ve been working on the side. it&#x27;s a wearable camera (don&#x27;t roll your eyes yet) that captures events from a first person view. the difference between this and other wearable cameras is how it&#x27;s worn. i used a makerbot to print the enclosure and bought a spy cam and gutted it to fit inside the enclosure. the device sits snugly on top and around your neck. it looks more like lg&#x27;s around the neck bluetooth headset. anyway, my reason for placing the camera there is that your neck experiences the least amount of shake and movement. and also because of the location and size of the device you can pack a much bigger battery. the whole motivation behind this camera is being able to passively record videos throughout your day in an unobtrusive manner. i know there are privacy issues regarding this but for me personally, i would like to capture events like while i&#x27;m traveling abroad or playing basketball. activities where having a place to mount a traditional camera is impractical. here are a couple videos with the prototype. what do you guys think?<p>shooting around bball - https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=m6ikydhtmpw<p>gun range - https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=-bi0tja8jvc<p>random walk - https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=f2usbtarzbw<p>ride in a lambo - https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=8unnz2finmi	2014-07-03 22:06:41 UTC		5	1	[]

3238560	i'm looking for a ruthless non-technical cofounder - american only.	i'm looking for a ruthless non-technical cofounder - american only.
basically, i got this idea, and now a beta. i need a ruthless douchebag mba. (consider the word douchebag as payback for people calling us "techies")
jokes aside. i need you to pitch stuff to retailers, cafés, restaurants and etc. 
and at the some time do some actual work on your end.
i'm also only looking for people in the us because of https://stripe.com/ - needless to say i'd avoid using paypal if i can.<p>i could use in-app purchases, but not ready to give up a 30% cut when we won't be so profitable at the start. though we are not losing any money (unless paying apple the 30%) also funding is not necessary.<p>i got the backend done and the ios client.<p>gimme a ping.
good comment!<p>we need vendors who want to sell their items on our platform. and then accept payment digitally. pretty much the most i feel like saying now. it's not that i am fearful and my billion dollar idea (hah!) is such a secret that barely i know about it. it's just that i'd like to say more to people who are sick of their jobs as consultant (moi) and want to move into a more product based work. a startup.<p>ps. not looking for product people, designers that only do photo shop or product people with photoshop skills. 
also this post is actually serious, i am looking for a us based sales person so i can use stripe in my app. and you can do your part... part-time for now.

487281	ask hn: please review our startup - timzon.com	dear hn,<p>we went live a little while ago with http://timzon.com, a site currently focused on private collaboration using video.  the concept is to enable threaded asynchronous video discussions between a group of individuals.<p>&#60;elevator_pitch&#62;
the office is virtual yet effective working relationships require knowing each other.  while face-to-face time is ideal, companies are cutting down on travel... business challenges and complexity have outgrown traditional collaboration like email, phone and video conferencing.  phones can't show the subject matter of a discussion.  email is impersonal and easy to misinterpret (an emoticon doesn't get the message across) and business video communication is only real-time which doesn't solve the time zone challenge.<p>however, since showing or demonstrating something is often the only way to successfully collaborate, a better solution is required.
&#60;/elevator_pitch&#62;<p>you'll notice that it's entirely free at the moment; we're on the freemium plan and are working on the "mium" part.<p>any and all feedback on http://timzon.com is highly appreciated.<p>thank you!<p>tony and jerome (timzon)	2009-02-19 14:44:58 UTC		10	9	[]

5664334	ask hn: founders, what would you tell yourself at 15?	i've been invited to do a talk tomorrow to a group of 15 year olds about startups. this is something i want to commit a lot of time over the coming years to do, and tomorrow is my debut.<p>scotland, where i live, has an incredible history of invention, but the days of scottish engineers and inventors changing the world are in the increasingly distant past (even dolly the sheep has been dead for 10 years).<p>it has never, for example, produced a software company of note (other than maybe owl for those who know their hypertext history). i'd like to see this change, and my hunch is that if you can plant some seeds in the minds of enough smart 15 year olds, then by the time these kids are 20-25 they are going to be way better placed to do great things.<p>in some places (i.e. sv) this can happen serendipitously through interactions with cousins, sisters, neighbours, etc. who are in the industry, but when the ecosystem is so well hidden (as it is here), most kids just don't know about this stuff until much later on (i.e during uni).<p>anyway, i've got quite a good bunch of slides pulled together and i speak fairly well at these sort of things (its no steve jobs commencement address, but it is ok).<p>however, i wanted to round the talk off with a bit of a discussion about ways to put themselves in the best position to do whatever it is they want to do, even if they don't know what it is yet.<p>any thoughts on this would be most welcome...	2013-05-06 19:46:51 UTC		11	15	[]

9559246	warn hn: resize of digital ocean instance corrupted filesystem beyond repair	careful with resizing on digital ocean...<p>a recent resize of a digital ocean instance corrupted the filesystem beyond repair. support have offered me a $80 credit and offered to restore from a backup.<p>you should probably snapshot your instances before resizing, or migrate to a new instance manually.<p>(thankfully i&#x27;ve built a replacement box from ansible in the meantime.)<p>the upgrade process appears to have involved copying to different hardware across the network, since the resize operation took over 15 minutes. that copy seems to be incomplete, which led to a completely unrecoverable filesystem.<p>on coming back up, the system displayed &quot;doroot does not exist after resize&quot;. running a filesystem check scrolled tens of thousands of e2fsck &quot;fixes&quot; for a period of 12 minutes.<p>as expected, the end result of that is that all &quot;files&quot; on the filesystem were in &#x2f;mnt&#x2f;lost+found with random names, and the data in them no doubt corrupt too.<p>digital ocean support does not appear to be able to re-copy or review the previous block device to determine the source of the problem. they also don&#x27;t appear to have logs of the resize operation.<p>sure - it&#x27;s always possible the filesystem was irretrievably corrupted before reboot - but i think it&#x27;s pretty unlikely. given that i&#x27;ve not been doing things like &#x27;dd if=&#x2f;dev&#x2f;urandom of=&#x2f;dev&#x2f;vda1&#x27; on there, that would probably indicate a hardware fault on their side anyway.<p>it&#x27;s worth noting that i rebooted the box successfully a few minutes before the resize, so a (journaled) e2fsck ran at that point. the filesystem was at least useable a few minutes before the resize.<p>(ticket #633210 in case anyone from digital ocean wants to investigate.)	2015-05-17 08:42:38 UTC		17	1	[]

324485	ask yc: feedback on our startup/application	http://www.onista.com<p>on october 2nd we (i and two of my friends) released the alpha version of our dreams, ideas and execution called onista. we are extremely excited to release it in open alpha with tons of hard-work behind it. i and two of my friends completed this version  in part-time (completely moonlighting) and now we feel that it is ready to get feedback from expert folks. so far we have informed only our friends/contacts so we can get feedback and iterate from there.<p>onista is an auction-less social marketplace where people can buy and sell products. onista is an amalgam of ebay, priceline, lendingtree, alibaba.com, and linkedin. onista allows instant price negotiation and enables buying products without searching.<p>here is quick summary of onista features,<p><pre><code>   1. auction-less format
   2. instant real-time price negotiation resulting in instant gratification for consumer
   3. buyers can buy products without searching and hunting for products using request for quotes and price quotes model like alibaba.com
   4. free listings for sellers
   5. sellers get open access to qualified sales leads and targeted product placements
   6. support for multiple payment systems (paypal, amazon etc..)
   7. a social network to build trading communities and mitigate the propensity for fraud
</code></pre>
please visit http://www.onista.com and enjoy the onista experience.
to understand more about onista, please do not forget to watch our demo video by clicking icon demo video on right-bottom corner of onista index page. alternatively you can also watch this video at http://www.vimeo.com/1594866<p>please provide us feedback about how we should improve onista. any feedback is welcome.
to give you an idea on what kind of feedback you can think of, (but again, any feedback will be appreciated)<p><pre><code>  * what is your first impression of the home page and also other pages?

  * what was confusing and what was not in entire site

  * what is complicated to understand, and how we can do it better?

  * would you use this site to buy or sell products? if no, why? what can we improve so it appeals to you? if yes, would you invite your friends to join?

  * we understand that we have lot more functionality for alpha version. does it help or it confuses you more?
</code></pre>
we also need your much appreciated help in spreading the word. if you find onista useful, please let your friends know by becoming member and inviting your friends from http://www.onista.com/invite.php<p>if you still reading this portion (meaning onista is little bit interesting) then please list some products to sell. our initial goal is to get many products listed because unless there are products to sell, the site would not be very useful. if you need any help in listing products, onista team can also help<p>thank you very much in advance,	2008-10-06 00:37:00 UTC		17	43	[]

941606	ask hn: i'm looking for a technical co-founder/partner.	i read hackernews almost daily, and i always enjoy the articles and the discussions about startups, software and code.  so, i'm hoping that there might be a similarly minded hn reader out there who is looking for their next big thing.<p>as a preface, i've had a lot of software developed, but i've never worked full-time on software with a co-founder/partner.  much of this is new to me, so i would definitely be open to comments or ideas about the way i'm performing this search from other members of hn, especially about the responsibilities i've listed below.<p>the offer : in one sentence, i'm looking for someone to work with me to build a software as a service business based in japan.  i'm experienced at it sales, running a business and managing people.  i have a large network of contacts in japan, and webnet it has a large 'built-in' active customer base that are interested in software that provides value to their operations.  webnet it is still my main operation, however i plan to spend a large portion of my time on this project once i find the right technical partner.<p>here are some basic guidelines that are important to me :<p>- skill sets.   i am not a coder.  i have plenty of experience on the it infrastructure side, and i've been running an it business for 7 years, but i have no coding skills beyond basic scripts, basic php/mysql and html.  i'm hoping to find someone who is passionate about coding, and has either the experience in creating saas systems, or the periphery experience and the ambition and ability to create this level of application.<p>- the idea.  i have a number of ideas based on software i've developed and our customers requirements, but i'm open to discussion.  i see this as something we'd generate and agree on together.<p>- personality and capability.  i imagine we'll be spending a lot of time working together, and as a result, personality and attitude (and a sense of humour!) are paramount.  this goes both ways - you need to be comfortable and happy working with me.  i don't really mind about your background.  i don't place too much stock in degrees and certificates.  i'd be much more interested to hear about your personal software projects, your personal wins and your work experiences.<p>- compensation. i'm open to ideas on compensation structures. if we get as far as discussing compensation, we can work out a fair and reasonable structure based on who you are, what you want, and what you can contribute.  naturally, "i want a large base and no revenue sharing or company percentages" is a very different conversation from "give me a place to sleep and x% of the company".<p>- how we work together.  i imagine that at the start, we'll discuss our ideas over skype.  i'll show you examples of the software i've designed and developed, you'll do the same for me.  we'll put together a basic arrangement, and we'll do a couple of small projects to get an understanding of how we both work.  when this goes well, we'll see if we can agree on a basic product road-map.  if this goes well, we'll put together a plan to launch, detailing responsibilities and milestones.  by this stage, we should have an agreement in place.  work begins.  within a few months, we'll need to be spending a good amount of time working together.  as such, i'd like for you to be willing, happy and able to move to japan.  as we get busier and as we acquire customers, i'd be hiring more developers and support staff, most likely working under you.<p>bio : like any relationship, or perhaps even more so, the co-founder/partner type relationship is based on trust and understanding.  as such, here is a brief biography to give you an understanding of who i am.<p>my name is jason winder, i'm australian, i've been living in japan for 8 years, and i run a business named webnet it that provides it services to foreign companies in japan.<p>introduction : i was lucky enough to get a 2nd hand clunker computer when i was a kid.  for the technically curious, it was a x8086 with a green tv as a monitor, two 5.25 floppy drives, no hard disk and about 128k memory.  i grew up breaking, fixing and learning from this computer. from the experience gained from this pc over the years, i landed a job working for a large company out of high school.  i then found work at a smaller company in australia, then i moved to japan.  i worked for various it companies for a couple of years, then i started my own company, webnet it.<p>webnet it : i didn't go to university, but i love learning.  i started from a blank slate in regards to entrepreneurship.  i've built up a consulting business by learning incrementally about business, sales and marketing.  during this process, i designed software and systems that automate mundane tasks, and assist us doing things like generating quotes, invoices, sharing information with our customers, and many other things. through this process, i've discovered i have a passion for developing software that helps people perform complex tasks both simply and efficiently.  i'd like to build on this and develop useful software to sell to people.<p>side note : my main pc these days is an apple 15" macbook pro. i built my home pc myself, it's an intel core2duo 3.06ghz running windows 7 with 2x24" monitors.<p>you would be responsible for<p>the technical and architectural infrastructure, initially all coding, eventually managing a small team of coders, brainstorming ideas, and creating a product roadmap with me.<p>i would be responsible for<p>sales and marketing, funding, general hiring and management, accounting, brainstorming ideas, and creating a product roadmap with you.<p>i imagine these responsibilities will evolve over time, however i think it's important to do some initial general planning on expectations and responsibilities.<p>if this describes you and your situation, or if you have any comments or thoughts, i would be very happy to hear from you.  please contact me at jason@webnet-it.co.jp.<p>thanks for your time reading this.<p>jason<p>tl;dr

1972001	beware self-funded startups: failure can haunt you for a long time	after years of success and decline, i'm stuck with over $150k in debt
when we didn't bring our expenses down as fast as our income dropped.
it didn't help that not everyone on the team was exposed equitably to
our debt instruments (all personally guaranteed, such is the only way
in a new company). i had better credit, and even though i own a
smaller part of the company, my credit lines were the ones that got
expanded (which i didn't even know was happening).<p>after stripping expenses to the bone, the business might slowly pay
off it's bills, say after ten years or so. it does have millions of
users after all. which means that this debt will haunt for years, and
i can't just leave it all behind, i'll have to deal with maintenance,
etc, for the foreseeable future.<p>my business partners bought homes at the peak, so between the business
and home, bankruptcy is looking like their option (i was not so, uh,
unlucky in my timing and have equity). either way sucks.<p>and now i'm looking to do something new. and while failure might be
rite of passage in startupland, hiring someone with such unrelenting
financial pressure is not really likely, is it? and the credit report
problems (business cards get switched to personal cards when not paid
on time, and guess which ones of them all didn't get paid on time?
yeah those with my ssn) will cause problems with a corporate job, as
credit reports are such a big thing in hiring these days.<p>lesson learned: get investors; share the wealth, share the risk.<p>so hn: what on earth do i do now?	2010-12-05 17:27:08 UTC		31	53	[]
321484	ask yc: i just got laid off, and i have some startup dreams.	some background: i graduated college a little over a year ago with an economics ba. i have the start of a career in game development; i did level design and scripting on a work-for-hire console license, which went six months from contract to ship. (not a sane schedule.) there was stress, long hours, a month of working weekends, but i'm fine now; and the game shipped.<p>since then the company hasn't gotten new gigs to support its staffing, so they had to let me go. both the founders said they'd have me back in a heartbeat; i can probably find a job in gaming again with some time. i'm also working on some open source game tech ( http://gamesc.sourceforge.net/ ) - if i had to point to one technical skill i'm best at, coding is probably it.<p>however, starting a startup intrigues me more than game projects, and this seems like the time to consider it seriously...but although i'm in the bay area, i don't have connections in the startup world, and i really want to tap into that experience. also, being deeply into games, i'd like to stick to that topic for business ideas. i don't know if i could buy into any old web app. working on any old game is better, but only a little bit. i'm really keen on finding something innovative to do in the sector(business-wise) and a team to do it with; something that's really disruptive. i think it's possible. but i don't think i can do it alone.<p>i guess my question would be: what would be the right steps to take, to meet the kinds of people i want to meet that would work together on this kind of startup? staying in the industry <i>might</i> be the way to meet the people i need. but i'm not convinced it's the best, or the only option.	2008-10-02 06:22:10 UTC		32	29	[]

5991332	tell hn: my first protest	i&#x27;m 27 years old and i&#x27;ve never really been bothered to protest before. sure, i&#x27;ve volunteered. i&#x27;ve participated in political campaigns. i&#x27;ve signed petitions and written my congressmen. i&#x27;ve voted. but nothing had ever felt quite so bad to me that i needed to march. other people would take care of that, as they always have, and the system would fix itself.<p>something&#x27;s changed. a little over a year ago today i enlisted in the army national guard. in a week i head to sd for &quot;phase 1&quot; of officer candidate school. (i don&#x27;t purport to represent the military).<p>perhaps the reality of putting my life on the line for our country has made me take political change more personally. of course, the past decades&#x27; worth of restrictions on our freedoms hasn&#x27;t helped. i&#x27;ve seen many comparisons here between warrantless spying and past oppressions, or with other states&#x27; far more terrible security apparatuses. &quot;it&#x27;s really not that bad.&quot; &quot;it could be worse.&quot; these all feel like false equivalencies.<p>we, of all people, should recognize the staggering, unpredictable impact that technology will have on our lives in just the coming decade alone. given what we know about the accelerating pace of technology, are you really comfortable giving the government – any government – free reign over all your data? do you want to set that precedent?<p>i&#x27;m no longer convinced that the system will self-correct. i see things coming to pass that make me worry for our collective future. i worry that if i don&#x27;t step up and say something, these worries will be completely brushed aside.<p>today i march. and i feel like it&#x27;s the best thing i&#x27;ve done since i took my oath of enlistment.<p>join me: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.restorethefourth.net&#x2f;protests&#x2f;	2013-07-04 16:26:11 UTC		50	1	[]

3417252	ask hn: are business podcasts a waste of time?	there seem to be dozens of podcast sites about business and entrepreneurship. i hate to call anyone out in particular, but just a few examples:<p><pre><code>  stanford's technology ventures podcasts
  mixergy
  this week in startups 
  etc.
</code></pre>
i've spent hundreds of hours watching these shows, and to be honest, i don't think i've actually learned anything. i'm starting to think that business is best learned by <i>doing</i>, not by endlessly consuming startup media. which is a shame, because i really enjoy watching the above mentioned shows.<p>anyone else feel the same way?	2012-01-02 20:44:26 UTC		1	0	[]

-give it away totally for free and try to make money from ads
or
-give it away for a limited time/limited extension and force them to be paid or leave<p>if it is paid, how to adjust pricing?

6322650	cvv codes without autocomplete attribute	whenever i submit a form with cvv codes i wonder about if the company is storing cvv codes.<p>i went to mydomain.com to update my cc and their form has a cvv code that doesn&#x27;t have the autocomplete=&#x27;off&#x27; attribute so my browser remembers the cvv number.
i opened a ticket to let them know.<p>mydomain.com:
&quot;cvv number is your additional protection to ensure that your credit card information is not being used fraudulently.&quot;
i replied - that is my point.<p>mydomain.com:
&quot;if you still feel cvv number is in the account seen please get back with screenshot of the page.&quot;
i replied - no, then you&#x27;d have my cvv code with is supposed to be private. (their ticketing system doesn&#x27;t allow screenshots either)<p>mydomain.com:
&quot;yes, the cvv number is not visible for the customers due to security reason.&quot;
i replied - it&#x27;s not pci dss compliant to store cvv codes, it may even be illegal.<p>mydomain.com&#x27;s legal response:
&quot;i wanted to personally take an opportunity and confirm that we do &quot;not&quot; store cvv information, nor do we store the entire 16 digits of a credit card.&quot;
i replied - how do you charge my card without the number?<p>mydomain.com&#x27;s legal response:
&quot;at this time we have no immediate plans on making specific changes to our billing submission forms as you have requested&quot;<p>it makes me uncomfortable using a company that doesn&#x27;t understand the internet to hold all of my domains. if you have suggestions of other domain registrars please comment. i am thinking of migrating.	2013-09-03 18:17:24 UTC		1	0	[]

7454206	feedback: how can i improve my app for college students?	hello hn,<p>i spent the last year working on my first ios app for college students. the app allows them to easily connect with other students nearby who are selling what others might be interested or buying what others may have for sale. i decided to take a different approach than before (previously with a website), this was i was able to build things in such as in-app private messaging with push notifications- so students no longer had to give out their private contact info. i&#x27;ve been testing this app out in one market (ohio university) and had &quot;decent&quot; traction. if you were in college what types of things would you look for in an app like this? i still need to build things in such as search filters &amp; work on the design, but before i spend anymore time or money on it i have to ask myself if this is even what the market wants.<p>if you&#x27;re a mobile developer or have an app what are your thoughts on the market? there&#x27;s a % of the market that graduates each year, not to mention theres a seasonality to this market as well. should i focus on a more lucrative market to justify my efforts?	2014-03-23 17:41:19 UTC	https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycampus-buying-selling-at/id703261109?mt=8	1	0	[]

6211559	ask hn: where/how do i learn very basic api skills?	i am learning to build software since this january. now i know the very basics of css+html, some javascript and c#&#x2f;.net. enough to create from scratch, publish and sell a very simple saas (in my case, the first &quot;s&quot; could stand for &quot;spreadsheet&quot;, so simple is my service).<p>i learned with codecademy, treehouse and try and error with the enormous aid of stack overflow. but now i want to create a very simple site using a api. and i can&#x27;t find the right place to learn it. i mean, even codecademy have this thread, but everywhere all api learning resources look aimed at more advanced developers.<p>there is no basic tutorial on how to do it. i mean, very, very basic tutorial, telling me how to establish the connection, where to write my code with the get&#x2f;post&#x2f;put&#x2f;delete, what the hell restful means and if this is something relevant to my basic code or just a theoretical base if you to go further down the road.<p>so i wonder, do i have to be a proper javascript developer to even start learning api? i am not a proper c#&#x2f;.net for sure, and still could build a simple logic with try and error. i guessed i could do the same with api, am i wrong?<p>ps: i already have a project in mind, i want to build a tool using the api of hnsearch: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.hnsearch.com&#x2f;api so i want to learn generic api development, not a specific one.	2013-08-14 14:09:01 UTC		1	1	[]

7957761	ask hn: mobile devt or web devt first?	wanted to have some views on which one to build first if a web app has both?<p>feature wise it would be like a simple list type of app (you could think of it as something that looks like hn) which is neutral to the platform, i.e it doesnt really matter in terms of user experience whether usage on web or mobile.<p>i have read that some people advocate using web application versus mobile development because its much easier to identify and solve problems and bugs, easier to write codes and build up a more scalable system. also, mobile has more updates and crashes. ruby on rails for example can allow for both web&#x2f;mobile especially with css bootstrap.<p>on the other hand, some say mobile is easier because you have things like html5 which allows for cross platform codes as well as being easier to build. one can just use javascript, css and html to bash something from say phonegap while on sqlite.<p>i have not arrived at anything conclusive and im quite new to programming. i did look up how guys on both platforms built (such as instagram, not because they are famous but they reveal their stack publicly :) ) but again no great insights either.<p>any thoughts on the pros and cons, suggestions and questions i need to ask myself? help is much appreciated! thanks!!	2014-06-28 08:23:59 UTC		1	1	[]

5952120	ask hn: crossroads for a programmer	i&#x27;ve been working for a company for a few years. it&#x27;s not bad. i&#x27;m responsible for deciding what technology and platforms we use for projects. after working in the place for a year, i was pushed up to the lead developer role, running a team of 6 devs and 2 interns. i&#x27;ve enjoyed getting the opportunity to mentor young programmers and sharing new ideas with one another.<p>this year, we were divided in to client work and product development. i was made the technical lead for the product development team.  no one was brought in to lead the client work, so i did that too.<p>early 2013, a bunch of client work came in. everyone was allocated to complete that. after we finished that, more arrived.  we couldn&#x27;t find any new hires so we were all kept on the client work.<p>in march, the boss was getting agitated that we haven&#x27;t been able to get on with building the product, so, our project managers freed us up and we had a three hour chat which listed the basic requirements.<p>this week, our marketeing exec and i was brought into a meeting with the investor to discuss a marketing plan. the meeting was out of the blue and it was the first time our marketing exec had an opportunity to discuss such a strategy. our boss and the investor could not agree on whether the product was b2b, b2c, etc. then they had a heated discussion about what the product was actually trying to achieve.<p>since february, i&#x27;ve been stuck on client work, or supporting existing projects, new hires and catching up on work that was left unfinished by aprubt leavers. we can&#x27;t keep new staff for any more than six months.<p>the company is successful in client work but there is no consideration given for time needed to spec and build the product. the product has no direction or vision, everyone has their own idea about the aims of the product.i&#x27;m on the verge of leaving as all my concerns are ignored.<p>any advice, tips, suggestions, would be much appreciated.	2013-06-27 13:25:56 UTC		1	2	[]

1922967	startup feedback - eventhomes.com	hi,<p>hoping to get some feedback on my recently launched startup - eventhomes.com. we're a "airbnb" for homeowners near major sporting events who want to rent their home for people attending the event.<p>www.eventhomes.com<p>background:
in 2004 the ryder cup came to my city in bloomfield hills, mi. i was in high school at the time and came up with the idea to create a site after speaking with a few home owners who had amazing properties on the golf course. i launched the site after taking pictures of a few homes in the area by going to door to door explaining my idea. i promoted it by creating a real estate listing on ebay for a ridiculous price of $1,000,000.00 (i knew at the very least the price would get people to click on it). the site ended up getting quite a bit of traffic from this but it was eventually caught by ebay and taken down (minor setback). the next thing i did was email every local news station in my city and i ended up getting a interview and a story about my site on the nightly news. after the story air'd i had hundreds of homeowners emailing me and i could barely keep up. two weeks later i got a nice letter from the pga's lawyers demanding i take down my site because the url contained their trademark "rydercup". since i was in high school, i didn't know what to do and ended up taking the site down and moved on. i always knew in the back of my mind i would try again.<p>with the new site, i decided to cover every major sporting event in the us and created a more generic name "eventhomes". we currently have over 200 homes available for the 2011 super bowl in arlington, tx.	2010-11-19 21:57:22 UTC		1	2	[]

9796217	ask hn: is this the correct next step in life?	i&#x27;m currently a senior biology major at a state school on the east coast.  lately i&#x27;ve been unsure of the next couple of moves to make, and seeing how this community is the most intelligent i know, i would like to gain some input.  i get decent grades (3.2 gpa) and i like my classes however i have not found that one niche i really love.  i have also began glassblowing, which is off topic but at the same time is a growing industry. ive been considering moving to california for a few years.  there, i would hone in on my glass skills (many more artists on the west coast i can learn from) and hopefully begin to pay off my student loans (over 120k in debt, and glass pieces can take 1-15 hours to make and range from $60-2000), save some money by growing my own medicine legally (i spend about 100&#x2f;week at least on it), and also getting a job wherever i can in my field working a minimum of 30 hours a week.  also i would be prepared to wait tables or anything else if i needed to. i was thinking of doing this and experimenting in a few different fields of biology until i found the subject i really loved.  my question is does this sound like a feasible path? or would i be better off working 2 jobs back here on the east coast trying to pay off my loans.	2015-06-29 03:09:18 UTC		2	1	[]

 - cascading style sheets
 - internet protocol / dns
 - uris / http
 - client side scripting
 - html ii - basic web apps
 - ajax
 - server side scripting
 - content types / data exchange
 - browsers
 - state &#38; local storage
 - privacy
 - security<p>for me, it feels really outdated. anyone can read documentation! do we really need thousands of graduates who know how dns works and do not know rails/cloud/mobile? and many modern topics are completely missed:<p>- jquery, other javascript frameworks
 - web frameworks: rails, djnago
 - cloud (aws, gae, ...)
 - mobile web: iphone/android/ipad
 - social apps...
 - payments
 - overview of apis (e.g. facebook, google, yql, twilio, paypal, google maps...)<p>what's your take guys? what should / shouldn't be in "web technologies 101"?	2010-07-08 01:09:39 UTC		2	5	[]

1522922	ask hn: to launch or not to launch	i've been working on a b2b saas billing site for almost a year now, we never officially "launched" it - but signup has always been open to south africans only. with just local users the business model has already proved profitable.<p>the question i'm stuck with now, is do we launch it internationally as soon as possible (after a couple days work with timezones and currencies) or do i wait till we're better equipped to deal with the traffic and growth.<p>1. we're a very small team at the moment, we're trying to hire urgently but unfortunately the task of finding top notch developers locally is more than a little challenging. a big concern is if its popular it is unlikely we'll be able to scale quickly enough (support wise, and service wise) -- our plates are pretty much full as it is.<p>2. i've been following the "move fast and break things" philosophy. i've achieved very rapid development (i'm the only developer), but it has come at the cost of occasionally broken parts of the site (generally for less than an hour). with &#60; 500 users this hasn't been a problem, but i'm assuming it will be once we've launched internationally. also 'service standards' in south africa are far worse than the rest of the world - which means our current users are generally far more forgiving than we expect international users to be.<p>3. i'd like to wait for the api to be ready (another post on that later). i've been working on an experimental api that i believe is pretty "cool" (you can browse it and test it out with a standard web browser)<p>has anyone here ever launched too early and regretted it? vice versa has anyone wished they launched earlier?	2010-07-16 23:28:43 UTC		3	1	[]

5487926	show hn: my weekend project  applicantchatter	i did a bad thing. i copied the business idea of someone on show hn.  deskanything - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5454844  - allows job applicants to ask questions of the employees of the hiring companies. it’s a great idea. i copied it for lame reasons; their idea wasn’t implemented, i needed it now, their plans didn’t match my needs, and it seemed like a fun weekend project.  so, i went ahead with it, and now it’s done.<p>my apologies to the deskanything guys.  if you want to join with me, let me know.  applicantchatter is on github, so you can always run with it.<p>my project is http://www.applicantchatter.com, a site which allows job applicants (or potential applicants) to ask employees questions anonymously.  employers sign up and add employees who will receive emails when a new question is posted.  employers will get a link to the “ask a question” page.<p>anyone with the “ask” link can post a question.  there’s a captcha to control spam, but otherwise it’s open to anyone with the link.<p>when a question comes in, the employees get an email with a link in it.  the question can be forwarded to the right person to answer.  anyone with the link can answer the question.  since anyone can answer, the answer has some anonymity.<p>my use case is the company i work for.  we have a great work environment, and i've been looking for a way to advertise that when hiring.  we're hiring an integration applications engineer soon (i'll post the link to the job description when it's available) and i built applicantchatter to use with it.<p>questions?  ask me!  http://applicantchatter.com/ask/the_ogranized_noses	2013-04-03 18:15:27 UTC		3	4	[]

470251	ask hn: finding a contractor to set up our server	i'm working on a software as a service app, and my co-founder and i are confident in the app itself, but not so much in our sysadmin abilities.  in order to feel comfortable taking people's money, we want to be confident that our server is set up correctly to handle the expected load and is secure.<p>this isn't something we want to trust to what we can pick up from reading books, articles, and tutorials on server administration -- we'd rather hire someone to do the initial server set up, and ideally find someone who could be around on a once-in-a-while contract basis to fix any issues that may crop up.<p>so the question is, how do we locate and evaluate such a person?   has anyone had experience in hiring a sysadmin on a contract basis to do some one-time set up work?	2009-02-06 20:03:23 UTC		3	13	[]

  consultant: uneasy if not doing billable work, keen to get billable work
  
  asked to work with awkward or outdated technology
  developer: moans that the client should move to a better technology
  consultant: understands the values it gives the client and does it
  
  asked to do something beyond their skill or knowledge
  developer: not possible, not doable
  consultant: can be done, but give me more time to find out how
  
  asked to do a variety of tasks
  developer: not very keen, only wants to write code
  consultant: happy to: code, design, test, support, do meetings, team lead, manage customers, etc...

4340304	ask hn: review this startup idea	this idea popped in my head during work today. i was hoping hn would a) tell me if this is viable and b) let me know if anyone is doing this right now.<p>i'm a business student going into my senior year of my undergrad degree. i'll be moving to silicon valley next year and after having internships all year for startups in ny i'd like to take a swing at things myself. i don't have a tech co-founder so i've been focusing on ideas that would not be insanely expensive to outsource, like the following idea.<p>i was thinking how my friends have a pretty difficult time shopping for their girl friends for anniversaries and special holidays like christmas. i also observed how my own girl friend gets really excited over random gifts i give her during circumstances when i'm not in trouble or when it's not a special occasion. yet guys don't really remember how little things can make their partners that much happier.<p>enter a new service. a paid, monthly subscription service where men signup and answer a questionnaire regarding their girlfriends/wives favorite things and tastes. a customer would receive one gift a month matching the inputted data. if he didn't like it he could send it back and not be charged for that month. the gift could even come wrapped for an additional fee. the mailing would include a non-descriptive return address so if their wife/girlfriend found the box it would just look like he purchased something off of amazon or another retailer.<p>during the beta phase i'd probably purchase from retailers based on the inputted preferences. and then eventually workout deals with wholesalers when i can purchase on a mass scale.<p>the key problem this startup would be solving is men's difficulty for shopping for their partners. it would allow men to avoid spending time shopping for random, "just because" gifts. and while they would still shop for their own personal christmas/anniversary gifts, this service would provide an additional gift for these occasions.<p>what do you think?	2012-08-05 01:47:57 UTC		4	11	[]

10110566	ask hn: with oil prices falling how is it that gas prices have stayed up?	i remember hearing something recently about federal laws preventing the export of crude in the us and so we stockpile it here which drives down the price. apparently, the same rules don&#x27;t govern refined products and so we can export lots of gasoline which is keeping the price of that up. is any of that accurate?<p>thanks.	2015-08-24 15:40:22 UTC		5	6	[]
5503831	ask hn: how can i make my resume better?	here is a link to my resume: http://imgur.com/0fsrjzi<p>for every 10 jobs i post this to, i get one response. for ever 5 responses, one phone interview comes out of it. for every 10 phone interviews, i get one invitation to interview in person. in the past year, i've had maybe 6 or 7 in person interviews. not a single job offer. i have completely no idea why i have such a hard time getting s job. i am at a point in my ife where i think it is time for a big change. i am considering hanging up my programmer hat. as much as i love programming, there is something i'm missing that is preventing me from doing this as a job. people always repeat on here and other software communities that if you are a programmer who has even a very very very basic grasp of engineering that people will literally throw job offers at you. i have to beg companies to hire me, and i get nowhere. i'm starting to put two and two together. i much not be a programmer with a modicum of skill.<p>what i want to know: when you look at my resume, what do you see? do you see someone who appears to know how to program? do you see anything that i need to badly change about my resume? most pf my experience is writing code by myself. the majority of my experience is on personal projects. my job history is very patchy (i havent been really employed since april 2012), so i have left that out.	2013-04-06 15:22:37 UTC		5	7	[]

2906281	ask hn: help hn, i'm being overpaid, can't build startup	long-time hn contributor, throwaway account, for reasons obvious.<p>i seem to found myself in a cosy local maxima problem: i'm currently getting paid a $1200+ daily rate, for building what is essentially a crud app, at however many days i like (statistically around 3-4 day per week, can do more, or less, just as long as products get shipped), working from home.<p>this seems like an ideal position to bootstrap a business from; however, i find myself in a strange lack of self-motivation which i usually had: all my senses are coming up blank.<p>to recap, my primary motivation with building businesses from scratch came from my aching pocket (cash); secondarily, the usual 3 creative motivators: autonomy/mastery/purpose. currently (and for the foreseeable future), all of these are satisfied (working from home, using whatever tools i see fit, on a project that will make a couple of million dollar difference for the client). challenge level is low, but that by itself doesn't lend itself to working on business problems specifically (eg. some machine learning ideas has a much higher challenge+reward rating).<p>i'm currently studying investing to figure out how to make the best of this situation long-term, and outsourcing for getting additional leverage. none of these are satisfying my intrinsic motivation of building high-impact online businesses -the core purpose i've been working on for the past 6 years.<p>is there something wrong with me? am i being maladjusted for still trying to achieve the same goals, but for obsoleted reasons? have you been in a similar situation, and if so, what was the correct way out?<p>thanks for reading.	2011-08-20 09:53:39 UTC		6	4	[]

- adding a new ssh key will now prompt for your password
- we will now email you any time a new ssh key is added to your account

5861066	what's a "normal" decline in benefits?	i joined a startup a year ago, getting the &quot;standard&quot; benefits: stocked kitchen, equity, good health care, unlimited vacation time... obviously these benefits were meant to make up for things like salary shortfalls.&lt;p&gt;since then, the benefits have declined, two of which i&#x27;ll speak about because they affect me the most. i&#x27;m curious whether this is normal, or whether it&#x27;s a sign of something worse.&lt;p&gt;weeks after my hire, we switched from a good health care provider to a much more annoying one (won&#x27;t get into details). slowly but surely the kitchen has gone from fully stocked to having a couple of things (was: fresh fruit, cereals, nutrition bars. is: yogurt, milk, oj and maybe bananas). the good coffee is gone, replaced by your average supermarket coffee.&lt;p&gt;how much of this is normal everyday life over the course of a startup? when i take a step back and review my past year, it definitely feels like the company has taken a big step backwards in this respect. the work is still interesting, and most of the people are great, so i enjoy that, but i start to feel a bit disappointed in the way the company is being run in a day-to-day fashion.&lt;p&gt;is this even something to bring up to anyone at the company? i don&#x27;t want to be a malcontent, but at the same time, i start to feel a little less of a bond with the company. i start to lose that feeling of &quot;hey we can&#x27;t pay you a great salary, but we&#x27;ll make it up by doing our absolute best in these other areas.&quot; i start to feel a bit taken advantage of, actually. it feels like death by a thousand cuts, or the whole &quot;boiling a frog&quot; thing. is this a normal part of the ebb &amp; flow of a startup? first raise money. then increase benefits to hire&#x2f;retain the best people around. then the money starts to disappear, so the cost cuts start. then raise more money, rinse&#x2f;repeat. or is this something more desperate?	2013-06-11 11:50:04 UTC		7	5	[]

8405550	student with over 600 spare hours is looking for cyber security project ideas	hello everyone!
i am a student who is finishing a masters degree in cyber security and digital forensics, and to complete my course i have to develop and submit a project by the end of the second semester.
originally, i was planning to develop an automated platform for internal penetration testing that runs on raspberry pi, but unfortunately for me, scoutbot was released (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;lansec.net&#x2f;project&#x2f;scoutbot&#x2f;) which means that my project idea is not unique anymore.
because of that, i am looking for another project idea and hopefully - you can help me.<p>what can i offer you? over 600 hours of work dedicated to the project by a student who is hardworking and eager to learn new things.
although i am not a programming guru, i have some skills in c#, java and python.<p>what am i looking for? a project idea that is related to cyber security (and it would be perfect if it is directly related to penetration testing since that is the career i pursue). 
i am still interested in using raspberry pi, so maybe someone can suggest me something related to it?<p>i will also be grateful for links to places where i could look for projects.<p>thanks.	2014-10-03 13:59:26 UTC		7	7	[]

6165278	prism could cost us cloud computing industry $22-$35 billion over 3 years	itif: &quot;given current conditions u.s. cloud service 
providers stand to lose somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of the foreign market in the 
next few years. indeed, some foreign providers are already reporting their success. 
artmotion, switzerland’s largest hosting company, reported a 45 percent increase in 
revenuein the month after edward snowden revealed details of the nsa’s prism 
program.17 and the percentage lost to foreign competitors could go higher if foreign 
governments enact protectionist trade barriers that effectively cut out u.s. providers. 
already the german data protection authorities have called for suspending all data transfers 
to u.s. companies under the u.s.-eu safe harbor program because of prism&quot;	2013-08-06 07:24:47 UTC	http://www2.itif.org/2013-cloud-computing-costs.pdf	8	2	[]

1861319	y we did not submit to y combinator	1. 10% arbitrary evaluation of equity arrived at via a pre-determined valuation of $6000(ave) is simply bs unless the ip is considered worthless upon consideration.
2. desperation does not equal success. when you sell-out, you have already sold-out. (ie the period enlightenment before sell-out) so no matter how successful you become, you will always have these $6k partners stymieing the proceedings from there-on-in.
3. middlemen are the problem with free-enterprise not the solution. they cunningly present themselves as the solution to the very problems they create. if you need one, you have nothing of real value.
4.ycombinator, despite their claimed virtues, are trying to control tech startups through simple avarice. they don’t control the end-user so they actually control nothing unless you submit to their bs.
solution: don’t sell-out.
persist.
if you build it, and they want it. they will come.
ycombination is a construct best ignored by the serious players.	2010-11-02 17:11:19 UTC		8	6	[]

7918280	ask hn: teenager with an idea that i'm passionate about, should i pursue it?	hello everybody! a quick background about me, i&#x27;m a 17 year old interested in programming. recently i thought of an idea for a web&#x2f;mobile start-up that i&#x27;m really passionate about. i&#x27;m hesitant to disclose the full idea at this point because if it really is a good idea there are people on here who have far more resources and talent that could potentially build it much quicker than i could. basically, it&#x27;d be a website&#x2f;apps that i believe could greatly aid the treatment of mood disorders.<p>why am i passionate about that? well, i&#x27;ve dealt with serious depression over the past few years that has almost taken my life. if the service that i want to create had existed i think my treatment could have been far more effective. in any given year about 10% of the us population (at least among adults), suffers from a mood disorder.<p>however, even though i&#x27;m very passionate about this idea, there are some major obstacles involved. namely, my service would need to be hipaa compliant in the us. the more i&#x27;ve read into that process the more i&#x27;ve been discouraged. ultimately after i build an initial version of the service i hope to run a kickstarter, but i&#x27;m not sure how i would go about achieving the funding i would need to run the site in production. i&#x27;m estimating the cost at a few thousand in the first year alone, potentially more depending on the popularity achieved.<p>so this is where i want opinions, if you had an idea for something that you believed could potentially benefit many individuals&#x27; lives, would you pursue it regardless of the obstacles, costs, and time involved? i guess in my mind this could be my chance to change the world, and i don&#x27;t want to miss out on that, but i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m being realistic.	2014-06-19 21:02:21 UTC		11	18	[]

1371767	ask hn: what this fact means about twitter (and web-startups in general)	twitter is a successful web service. perhaps, i can say it is amazingly successful, this is nothing to be argued about.<p>yet, it seems to be the only popular web service which require installation of third parties and sometimes desktop applications to power-use it. that is, using gmail within your native mail client (via pop/smtp) is nothing comparing to the gmail client itself. same applies to youtube, facebook, friendfeed, and any other one you can think of.<p>those services are all shipped with a well invested web client that evolves and renew itself once in a while. twitter.com on the other hand, is becoming a mass, or perhaps useless, if you want to follow more than 25 people. tweetdeck seems to be far better client than twitter.com<p>this support pg's claim that twitter is a protocol, not just a web application or a web service. as such, we can treat it as torrent or any other protocol/hub.<p>but the point i am trying to make is that we might should look at web startups from different angle. in an era which everyone is willing to move into the cloud, perhaps one should focus about infrastructures and apis and not on a rich client development, leaving the clients and apps to the echo-system which would built around the core service.<p>i refer to twitter.com as a demo application for the twitter capabilities, and not the the "twitter". this distinguish between twitter and twitter.com is astonishing to me, and i would be glad to hear more opinions about this.<p>love you all,<p>tzury	2010-05-23 04:12:20 UTC		30	17	[]

801208	ask hn:  am i crazy?	so i just graduated college in the spring and i have about $1500 in savings that i could spend on the deposit + rent/moving expenses for an apartment somewhere and continue looking for a job, but something in me is telling me there's a better way.  i have a plan, but i want to see if you guys think i'm crazy (if hn thinks it's too out there, then i know i'm off-base) or if i'm going to need more money or what.<p>i have known for some time that there's something different in the brain of an entrepreneur that changes the way they see the world, and i want to find out what that is.<p>so i want to set out to find entrepreneurs, either through appointment or serendipity, and spend a little time with them.  just get to know how they decided to do what they do, what keeps them going, what their hopes and dreams are, etc.  i posit that there's commonalities to be found there and a lot of insight to be gained from those commonalities.  my contacts are somewhat slim, and it would probably be reasonable to spend a few years building up more, but something tells me now is the time to do this and it's getting harder and harder to ignore.<p>i spent some time as a freelance writer, so i believe i can make the result compelling and interesting.  but there's a lot of things i need to work out, and this is where i need your help:
- do i have enough money to do this long enough to produce anything of substance? (numbers at the end of the post)
- how should i publish this?  it could be a blog that i update regularly, an ebook that i put together as i go, a physical book (leaning away from this for many reasons) or some combination thereof?
- can i somehow monetize this as i'm working on it so as to extend my trip?
- how should i pitch the project to potential subjects?  free publicity?  altruism?<p>numbers:
a trip from chicago(where i live) to ny, boston, new orleans, austin, sf, seattle, back to chicago is 7695 miles.  i'm thinking $700 for gas, oil changes, and some other tune-up stuff before i leave/along the way.  if i eliminate the west coast, this drops to around 4000 miles, if i just do sf and seattle (this is probably what i'll end up doing) i end up with around 5000 miles.<p>i have no aversion to couch surfing, sleeping in my car or camping, all of which i've done plenty of.  with around 5 days of pure driving, i can spend a month doing this at just over $20/day to spend on food/bribery.<p>my hope would be to get around 15-20 case studies of at least an hour or so interview time, plus maybe shadowing and secondary interviews.  though this is flexible.  i think this would be enough for a worthwhile product.<p>so.  am i crazy?  should i do it?  suggestions?  volunteers?  donations...?<p>also, you can email me at alex |at| mohrslaws.com	2009-09-02 21:59:00 UTC		89	92	[]

2382948	ask hn: building a better audiobook website/community	fellow hackers:<p>i'm currently working on a new project in the realm of audiobooks to expand my business (american consumer news, llc). the site will have a heavy focus on content (best sellers lists, landing pages for audiobooks, reviews, a blog section), but i'd also like to have some social elements to the site (without it turning into a niche social network).<p>what we've got done so far can be seen at http://www.audiobooktopia.com/<p>the question that i'm wrestling with is what social features would be useful.<p>the ideas that i have so far are: 
- the ability to create lists of audiobooks and share them with the world (i.e. "matt's top five lifestyle business books")
- the ability to write reviews of audiobooks and share them publicly. 
- the ability to keep tracks of books that a user has read, would like to read, etc.<p>are these features good/useful social features? is there something else i should be doing in addition/in-place of these?	2011-03-29 15:25:56 UTC		1	0	[]

5162599	managing customer service at fast growing start-up	hi guys,<p>i have been facing the challenge of managing the customer support at my small but growing start-up (300 customers).<p>right now i am working with zendesk to handle all the incoming emails/voicemails on a daily basis. it's a pretty manual job right now with lots of personalized emails and not a lot of automation. once a couple of categories/macros have been created i am confident that it will do a pretty good job at getting through the daily inquiries. however, i would also be interested in incorporating/working with customer feedback in our business and was wondering what kind of tool you guys use for that?<p>could somebody share its experience with facing this task? which software do you guys use, how do you organize customer service and how do you make it scalable?<p>would be awesome to get some input from you!

9609203	ask hn: how do i decide what area in my field (cs) to enter?	tldr: incoming junior with two years of university left, so limited time for projects&#x2f;research&#x2f;grad school applications, but endless forks in the road: web development, network and systems, machine learning, software development, etc. where to go?<p>---<p>if you were once halfway through university, had a variety of interests and only an introductory knowledge of your field, how did you decide which option to pursue for the rest of your life?<p>for example, economics grads, how did you end up in labor economics? history grads, how did you decide on 7th century middle east? cs majors, how did you know you wanted to study complexity theory in grad school?<p>reasons for asking:
1. with two summers left before i apply to grad school or for jobs, i want to focus on 1-2 things i can pour all my effort into.
2. it&#x27;s really uncanny listening to classmates who know exactly what they want to do. makes me feel like i don&#x27;t have a plan.<p>from all the courses i&#x27;ve taken so far (the usual discrete math, algorithms&#x2f;data structures, a programming in c++ course) have told me little about what i enjoy. i read a few posts on machine learning and while they were for a lay audience, i really enjoyed them. the trouble is that a. i don&#x27;t know enough about all these emerging fields to pick 1-2, and b. i have interests outside cs as well (history, writing) and i&#x27;m not sure how to reconcile these.<p>i know i shouldn&#x27;t be looking for an &quot;aha!&quot; moment. but going into junior year with no real idea is scary.<p>any advice - anecdotal or not - is welcome. thanks for reading!	2015-05-27 03:42:13 UTC		1	0	[]
5726347	the best thing you can carry in your pocket: a digital local friend in any city	reviews are typically about food, movies, or books. you don’t think to review the small moments that make up your day. these seemingly insignificant but frequent raves &#38; rants, such as the long line at starbucks, or the short wait time at the apple store, make brief appearances in your life yet bring out memorable reactions. sooligan is a real-time social search platform where users can find &#38; share thoughts or feelings regarding local experiences and moments. we capture raves &#38; rants of locals in any city, at any time.<p>we just created this app, let us know what you think!<p>remember: you're not a hooligan, you're a sooligan. and together, we can make local search cool again :)	2013-05-17 19:44:09 UTC	https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sooligan/id589006615?ls=1&mt=8	1	0	[]

7639991	from developer to co-founder: please advise me	hello everyone. (assuming this ever gets seen and read!) i have a situation where i need some advice. my scenario is that 2.5 years ago, i created a business from a side project. it&#x27;s anti-piracy software&#x2f;service, and it&#x27;s got a relatively sophisticated back end -- spidering, automation, scaling to large data sets, etc). it&#x27;s a fully functional, revenue-generating business. growing very quickly, in fact.<p>but because of how i developed it as a side project, i have no ownership share, i&#x27;m not a co-founder in a legal sense, in other words. it&#x27;s just a company that was spawned during my free time, at the parent company i work for (a very small, private company, in case you were wondering about which one).<p>i&#x27;m attempting to get the president of the parent company i work for to restructure the anti-piracy business in such a way that i have some kind of co-foundership or ownership share. she claims we would have to implement a complicated (for tax purposes, etc) esop system, which costs 30 to 50 thousand dollars annually, just per regulations, is what she told me. so that&#x27;s out. plus that&#x27;s not co-foundership, which is what i&#x27;m looking for.<p>so maybe my question is: is anybody interested in seeing some very interesting numbers, having a very interesting discussion about an anti-piracy business, and possibly looking into a future venture? maybe that&#x27;s my question: who do i approach about that? i don&#x27;t live in the bay area.... and i haven&#x27;t, in the past, been especially familiar with start-up culture (aside from reading about it on here =)), or the methods of starting a small technology company.<p>thanks!<p>j	2014-04-24 13:06:55 UTC		1	0	[]

1398858	ask hn: crazy idea #12539: smart rss to email gateway	has the following been done to your knowledge and if not what do you think of the idea?<p>rss is one more 'inbox' you have to monitor. some people on hn are working on improving rss by applying bayesian filtering to rss feeds to pick out the items that you are most likely interested in.<p>i'm a little bit old-fashioned in a sense that my email inbox doubles as my to-do list. the reason for that is simple, email is something i'm going to have to deal with anyway, so i send myself one-liner emails with a [todo] header in the subject so i can easily sort them.<p>rss would add another input queue to monitor, and that's why i have so far stayed away from 'readers', instead i just have a very limited set of sites that i visit.<p>but even then you have to filter out the items that you are interested in.<p>how about tying in the idea of very smart rss filtering so that that the stream gets reduced to manageable proportions (with caps on the number of messages per day and so on), and gateway that in to a periodic digest to your inbox?<p>that way you only have to monitor one stream for events.<p>crazy ? or useful ?	2010-06-02 18:21:50 UTC		1	1	[]

6514790	breaking tor	i recently read an article about the nsa trying to break tor. they seem to have a lot of problem with this. if you really wanted to look at all the tor traffic in your country as a government, this should be possible.
you should be able to do this with a type of mitm attack. you could advertise all the tor relay agents ips inside your isps to point at your own servers.
you could either try to setup 3500 tor relay agents or a more practical way would be to get one server to act as a relay server for all.
either way you should be able to read the transmission both ways unencrypted without problem if people don’t use pre shared keys.

2454699	wanna build a "best of hn/insert-feed-here" daily feed? or it exists?	i love hn but i don't have time to read the 1,000 new posts and thousands of awesome comments every day. i'd love to have a program that, say, every hour looks at the posts from the last x hours and selects the one that was commented on or retweeted (or most-something by whatever metric) and then posts that one post to an rss feed/page/twitter. so i can just get the, say, 5 best posts per day. or something like that. this system could be expandable to use for any rss feed (i.e., i want to subscribe to, say, andrew warner's friggin' awesome twitter but he posts so much, i just want to see his best post per day!). i would love this system and i'd help build it, market it. we can open source it! would this interest anyone? or does anything like this exist? it would be a fun project! :) thoughts?

5491517	show hn: export/embed a dropbox folder as a gallery	hi all.<p>i'm working on a small web app that lets you export/embed any dropbox folder as an html gallery.<p>some technical details: the app requires full dropbox access, but this is only to get a list of folders and navigate through them. no files are stored on my server, everything is done through dropbox and your browser. the whole things is done in javascript/jquery using the "official" javascript implementation of the dropbox api (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdk).<p>usage: after logging into dropbox and connecting the app, choose a folder with images you want to use. after it's loaded, you can either save the gallery inside the app's folder in your dropbox (generated files will include time and date of creation) and optionally download the html file directly from dropbox or click the embed button to get the html code.<p>you can see a more detailed how-to with screenshots at www.fourtonfish.com/dropshowgallery/howto<p>the app is in a pretty early stage, but i would like to start getting feedback and make sure the core of the app is working. i plan to add customization options for the gallery, different styles etc.<p>direct link: www.fourtonfish.com/dropshowgallery<p>a note: i don't think this should be a problem yet, but just in case: while the app is in development mode, only 100 users can connect to it (5 slots are already taken) - this is a dropbox limitation.<p>i would appreciate any feedback on the app (design, functionality etc).<p>thanks in advance, have a great day everyone :)	2013-04-04 07:55:43 UTC	http://fourtonfish.com/#dropshow	2	1	[]

1. a good developer (i have started to talk to a chinese developer who is asking for $5000 for ios app) 2. a great ui&#x2f;ux designer ( i have a friend ready to do the work for $1000 but i’m kind of a perfectionist and don’t really see him do a good job) 3. and most importantly, trust in working with a person i don’t know in china with the probability of my intellectual property being stolen. i am a very trusting person in life. not in business.<p>i could potentially safe guard the core functionality from the developer in china, and have another developer complete it. however, i do foresee some issues with integration of both modules. i’d rather have one developer to work on it from the start. maybe even partner.<p>even if this idea of mine is stupid, i’d still want to give it a shot. i was looking for places that i could meet like-minded people around la, but haven’t found any lately.<p>what would you guys suggest?	2014-12-11 20:20:14 UTC		2	5	[]

937458	ask hn: why do you want to be an entrepreneur?	when i saw this question, my first thoughts were as follows.  looking at these, not sure if they're exactly on point, but they sure do reveal a bit about my thinking.<p>* when i see a problem, i can’t help but fix it.<p>* inefficient processes piss me off.  i instinctively start thinking of better solutions.<p>* i love shortcuts and using system to my advantage.<p>* i get a kick out of being resourceful and coming up with duck-tape solutions.<p>* i enjoy doing a different thing each day and look forward to challenges and crises.<p>* i want to make the calls – more than that, and i want to be responsible for any bad decisions.<p>* i need to make a difference in the world.<p>[see also: http://euwyn.com/2009/11/12/why-do-you-want-to-be-an-entrepreneur/]	2009-11-12 10:05:27 UTC		4	2	[]

65329	my yc idea:  user-created-language	what if we could communicate beyond words?
the idea is fairly simple. creating a database of images for each word. for each word in the dictionary their will be images (that best describe it) uploaded by users. now someone can write a a letter and most of the words, if not all, will be converted into images and sent to the recipient who can also decipher the message after attempting to read it.
i want to create a real interaction in messages. one that goes beyond words. 
to make it smart, i will use the a ycnews voting style for each image. <p>btw, i can use one more hacker<p>	2007-10-09 17:07:34 UTC		4	23	[]

959992	ask hn: what to do about our latest app store rejection?	like many iphone developers we've had a fair selection of problems and rejections on the app store, but i'm not here to complain about that. i'd more like to hear suggestions on what we should do next...<p>background:<p>as a project to learn objective-c we decided to remake an old flash game we'd made several years ago that had been popular at the time. the game is basically "simon" (remember the flashing lights sequence) but tapping cgi bikini covered women on their behinds, in the memorised order. as you go through the game you win various awards which are represented as playing cards with photos of women in bikinis on them.<p>we've been rejected for several reasons over the last 5 months, some of which were without any given reason, others for reasons where one may disagree with them but you can at least see where they are coming from. (e.g. tapping women was considered violence aginst women, so we changed it to a feather tickling them, which was also considered derogatory - we now have a set of drums in front of each and they just dance to specific "beats")<p>having gone through all of these rejections including one reviewer who called us and told us that if we changed it from the feather tickling to drums then we would almost certainly get approved, we have now been rejected again. this time because one or some of the award cards can be seen as "objectionable content".<p>the images we use are all pg13 at the absolute worst, but we've rated the app at 17+ in the app store. as usual there are apps already out there with far worse images but that isn't really an argument we can put to anyone.<p>an email back to the review team asking which cards were considered objectionable was met with a copy and paste from the t&#38;cs (section 3.3.14).<p>as this project was a learning experience that has led on to other work and projects it's not been a complete loss and we never expected to get rich from it, but it has been a frustrating experience (one we've not had with our other apps, all of which are non-adult themed.)<p>we're staying positive and looking at the options
do we:<p>a) keep trying to appease the different reviewers we get assigned who have different levels of judgement. we feel like we are working in the dark though.<p>b) just take out all the awards, leaving a game that tbh isn't unique and certainly not worth selling<p>c) try selling via a jailbreak site such as cydia, might this harm our relationship with apple down the line?<p>d) put large semi-sarcastic "censored" text over each image and release it as a free game?<p>e) not waste any time on it and ditch it?<p>f) something else?<p>thanks for any input	2009-11-24 21:32:46 UTC		5	1	[]

3107049	ask hn - do we really need recruiters?	say one gets paid $75 an hour, out of which the recruiter keeps 10-15, which works out to 20-30k a year.  they use questionable tactics (many of them), treat the very programmers/designers that bring them money badly.  other than pushing resumes and making a few phonecalls to arrange interviews, in most cases they don't do anything else.<p>in other industries like housing for example, brokers do quite a bit of work (at least, much more than recruiters).  even they don't take 20% of the billing rate, hour after hour (my broker charges one month rent, sometimes even less, when he helps someone find an apt).<p>why do we still need them?  isn't there any way we can at least reduce our dependency on them?	2011-10-13 13:12:18 UTC		6	3	[]

6904888	ask hn: how do i start/run a company without being resident anywhere?	i&#x27;m pretty much always traveling, so i don&#x27;t have a fixed residency. my parents own two apartments in two different parts of the world and i also have a large family spread across the world who i frequently visit - usually not staying in a country longer than 2 months. i&#x27;m 19 years old, eu-citizen and developed a saas app which scaled rapidly to about 7k&#x2f;mo revenue in about 6 months. i ran the whole thing illegally, which was pretty stupid i know - hence i took it offline while i decide how to structure the business&#x2f;accounting side of things and also rewrite the code to be more scalable&#x2f;automated. my questions are:<p>in which country should i form the company? ultimately i want it to be fast and simple (aka electronic), countries like the uk and singapore have all-online and quick company formation.<p>what&#x27;s the best way to automate accounting? i was looking at xero.com as they provide an api which i can use to automate customer invoices and handle payment processor receipts - which brings me to my next problem, how am i supposed to open a business bank account without a real proof of address&#x2f;residency?<p>where am i supposed to pay my personal taxes?	2013-12-14 06:29:25 UTC		10	6	[]

243920	ask yc: finding a co-founder(s)	i've been out of school for almost a year and a half now, working as a financial analyst for a large finance/accounting firm in los angeles.  i've known for quite some time that i won't be truly happy working for a large company and that entrepreneurship is in my blood (no one in my family works for anyone else).  i also spent two years in college doing sales for a small web services/software company and got a lot of exposure to the development of a saas solution and the web as it relates to small-to-mid-size businesses.  i spend a significant portion of my free time researching the web, writing mock business plans, and trying to develop ideas that i have.<p>but the one thing i continue to struggle with is finding someone else who wants to form a startup.  i work with some very smart people, but the problem is, their whole game plan is built around climbing the corporate ladder, whereas mine couldn't be more opposite.  so what is the best strategy for someone like myself to find a trustworthy, hard working partner to form a startup?  i fully respect what programmers/engineers/hackers bring to the table and i feel that i would compliment those skills very well.  i also have a pretty good understanding of the web and wouldn't consider myself one of those "pie-in-the-sky" business types that are responsible for that stereotype.  i'm just a guy looking to build something cool, solve some problems, and maybe make enough to quit my day-job.  sorry for the long post, but what are your thoughts?	2008-07-11 19:44:30 UTC		19	34	[]

572932	ask hn: programming language power and 10 years to mastery	i've been thinking about the intersection between the variability in programming language power and expressivity (as discussed by pg in http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) and the 10 year (or 10,000 hours) road to expertise.<p>i’m around year eight of hacking away professionally and bumped against the dramatic power differential in programming languages when i primarily became a database developer.  i started "thinking in sets" and found that i was much more effective.  sql got more work done in fewer lines of code in a simple way than hooking up my j2ee java junk via jdbc in more traditional programming.  but it took the direct use of sql for a couple of years before the experience pushed my coding to the next level.  much of this benefit was due to the fact that the apps i worked on were really data driven and "fit" the relational data model well, coupled with the fact that i was in a role that allowed me to do architecture design and low level implementation.  and tear the design and implementation apart to do it again after finding all the nuances in the app and data.<p>the switch from imperative programming languages to a declarative programming language to take advantage of sql has made me curious about lisp and functional programming.  i have an idea for a web app and i’ll use it as a vehicle to test out lisp.  worst case, i pick up a language that purports to have almost mystical powers (all hail the mighty macro).  best case, a nice startup could grow out of the project.  but the real point is to get real hands-on experience with a more powerful language than the standard c, java, perl, and sql stuff i’ve already done.  plus, i’d hate to miss out on some key part of a hacker’s personal growth over that 10 year march . . .<p>that’s a lot of background to get to two simple questions.<p>do any of the hn readers have any tips or advice on speeding up the transition to "thinking in lisp"?  i’ll probably be hacking away using practical common lisp and on lisp as my guides (sicp is probably somewhere in the mix).   have any of you followed a similar path as you head towards a decade of hacking and did the lisp (or other fp language) dance grow your skills in a big way (ie, now i’m a faster developer in general or better algorithm designer or communicator of code ideas)?  it would be great to hear specifics.<p>thanks.	2009-04-21 20:25:43 UTC		25	42	[]

2224098	ask hn: i need advice. major problems with my business & co-founder	hello hn,<p>first off, i'm a regular hn member with 4-figure karma (if it matters). i'm at a loss and need advice.<p>i am the technical co-founder of a 5 year old company with $2m in annual revenue and 5 f/t employees. over the past 18 months, i've become increasingly at odds with my business partner. my partner already has a relative working for us, then last year brought in a "designer" who is a close, personal friend and gave this person free reign on redesigning all of our print and web properties. problem is, this person is a traditional graphic designer with no web experience. my design skills aren't superb, but i know ui/ux basics, how to measure and test things, seo fundamentals, etc. my partner has basically given this friend an executive marketing position.<p>our traffic has been flat for a year or more. our sales are down slightly. instead of hustling, working on seo/sem, learning analytics and a/b testing, good product and customer development–basically all the things a non-technical co-founder should do–my partner and collegue waste countless hours dicking around with pointless design aesthetics or useless networking events. over the same period, my partner has had personal issues as well (left his wife).<p>last year, after some conflicts between myself and this designer, i told my partner this person had to go. he agreed but never followed through. when i pressed this issue, he simply claimed this person is "too valuable". since then, we argue constantly. maybe i'm wrong, but as i see it, a year + is a long enough "experiment" ... this person is doing nothing to improve sales, there's a major conflict of interest, and should go. with my business partner, we might be past the point where the damage can be repaired. there is definitely no trust on my part.<p>we each own 50% of the company and are the only board members. in multiple meetings with an attorney, i discovered that our company has no deadlock provision for resolving major decisions. even more interesting–i never signed the buy-sell agreement in our corporate papers (he did). so, technically, i could sell my stake to anyone at any time–but he can only sell his shares back to the company. other than an outside company acquiring all or half of the company, the only other option would be for me to move to simply dissolve and split or sell the assets.<p>there is so much technical knowledge about the business in my head, that i'm fairly certain it couldn't function well without me (at least not without a solid transition period).<p>what to do? i have a family and the company has treated me well financially. but there are a lot of things i still want to do startup and entrepreneur-wise. do i give an ultimatum? can i shop my half of the company to others in the industry without alarming them?<p>thanks hn. you're a constant source of insight and inspiration.	2011-02-16 00:05:42 UTC		77	36	[]

7693954	ask hn: how can i find a mentor?	there was an hn thread a few months back about autodidactic programmers, and many people said that one of the most important things for a developing programmer is to have a good mentor.<p>i think i&#x27;d really like a mentor.<p>some things about me:
i&#x27;ve been coding for maybe a year, but i have a full time job so progress is not going as fast as maybe i&#x27;d like it to.<p>i&#x27;ve been doing python (a very small amount of c# as well). i&#x27;ve read an intro book, and now i&#x27;m reading a book that goes into more depth with oo. i&#x27;ve solved the first 51 project euler problems, many of them with relatively elegant algorithms. i have a love for elegant algorithms.<p>i&#x27;m not sure what to do next.
build a django app?
learn java and build an android app?
learn haskell?
learn c?
something else entirely?<p>i&#x27;m not locked into any particular field of programming yet - it all interests me.<p>if anyone feels like they would get any benefit out of mentoring someone like me, looking at my code and giving me pointers, giving me advice about what&#x27;s wise to learn, i&#x27;d really appreciate it.	2014-05-04 11:42:33 UTC		104	49	[]

1750941	facebook movie and ethical dilution of partners 	in the social network, eduardo signs a document that somehow allows the board to dilute his ownership to almost nothing.   what is that document?  does he just lose his board seat?  maybe some sort of veto right?  maybe the articles of incorporation specifically allow this?<p>issuing shares solely for the purpose of diluting one partner would generally be a violation of ethical and legal standards, as i understand it.  how would one protect himself from this without owning a majority?  how often does this happen?<p>i've heard of vcs "cleaning the cap table."  this sometimes seems justified, but who decides and how can it be done legally and ethically?<p>if the cap table is just temporary, and can be changed by the board through dilution, what meaning does it have?  however, if it can not be changed and there is a deadbeat partner, some sort of action like this may be necessary.  in facebook's case, as show in the film, i'm guessing they did this damn-the-consequences figuring they would pay eduardo off some day, rightfully presuming it would be cheaper than leaving him with a huge stake.  	2010-10-02 18:01:22 UTC		1	1	[]

5996834	ask hn: is there a way to reinstate a community page suspended by facebook?	recently (just past midnight (eest) on july 6) a community page on facebook belonging to &quot;ötekilerin postası&quot; https:&#x2f;&#x2f;facebook.com&#x2f;otekilerinpostasi was suspended. the reason for this is not clear at the moment. this page was extremely useful for disseminating information during the events that unfolded in turkey over the past month or so. this community was founded to act as citizen journalists and did so superbly. as many members of the hn community may know, the events are not over (e.g. there were multiple detentions today, the construction of underway passage is being continued despite a court order for stopping it, a demonstration is planned on saturday in taksim square etc.), so this suspension will cut off a very valuable news source for many people. does anyone here know how to go about to reinstate this page?	2013-07-05 21:29:34 UTC		1	1	[]

3030531	ask hn: how to find an interesting internship?	hello hn readers,<p>i'm a french student currently studying computer science in dublin (trinity college), and i would like to know if you have some tips to find &#38; get a good/interesting internship during summer '12.<p>for the record:
- i enjoy mainly c/python programming but i would be happy to learn something else (like functionnal programming for instance)

5247176	todombo.com - todo dashboard with widgets instead of todo lists	hi everyone.<p>i want to describe an idea of todo dashboard. everyone knows about todo websites like rememberthemilk.com, todoist.com and others. in our opinion, this approach lacks expressiveness, and it would be great if you could write down something like "meet bob at 8pm" and system understands who bob is and that 8pm is actually 20:00.<p>this brings us to the idea of widgets - cards that represent different types of tasks like meetings, deadlines, notes, bookmarks etc. and dashboard on which these widgets can be placed.<p>depending on a task type widget has different representations and functionality, but the main point is to show user information about his tasks not in plain text.<p>we have created a prototype of the application - todombo.com.<p>our current version supports only one type of widgets - simple cards with title and description. any feedback would help us a lot since we don't understand whether this idea makes sense to other people or not.<p>thank you.	2013-02-19 21:31:23 UTC		2	2	[]

-recommendations based on tracking your clicks.
-recommendations based on random reviews.
-recommendations from your friends.<p>you can spend countless hours surfing! since we love technology, we theorized that if there was a website that helped shoppers discover new products based on their own personalities, that website would solve the above problems. we also took it a step further by allowing the shopper to share their discoveries with others - thereby solving the problem of the bad gift.<p>with that theory and goal, mialio was born!

3849200	idea hn: qr inside video for ad's	use cases:
1. social:you are watching tv with friends ad is shown,u might want to know more about product/buy it.you just need to click with qr app.
2. crowd: you are at times square(or a place like that!) ad is shown u want to buy it.you can buy it/know it instantly.
3. no_cable:you are watching ad in a medium which does not have two way connection.
advantage for ad companies:
1. they can catch/track you where they cannot in general track.
2. they have something measurable
3. they connect with you instantaneously.
idea:
idea is to create a simple platform where ad companies will provide the link where they expect the user to land or create a page for their brand on the site and upload their video.qr would be generated based on the link and encoded in a video.all the traffic will go through our platform and would provide rich analytics.
need ur inputs:
1.is this a viable idea?
2. are there already companies that do it(i googled it couldn't find anything substantial)
3. what do u think? should i try working on this
criticisism is welcome :)	2012-04-16 20:19:38 UTC		2	3	[]

5778505	speed-up your project build without the tmpfs hassle	running all tests in my current project takes some time. with 26 gb of free memory, why not use it for something useful? tmpfs is one way to speed up the test execution. a common approach is to work directly in a tmpfs folder and backup your work to a folder on disk with cron. i found this setup a bit complicated and error prone. i never really trusted my own setup on boot time and with cron. now i use a much simpler setup that is not using cron at all.	2013-05-28 06:36:01 UTC	http://theyougen.blogspot.com/2013/05/speed-up-your-project-build-without.html	3	0	[]

2914523	ask hn: high-level languages w/static allocation	simply: i mainly develop for embedded systems (that must not use any type of non-deterministic memory allocation). for associated projects, i've started to use python quite a bit and have fallen in love with the tuple and list primitives built into the language (among other features). naturally, i <i>only</i> use c for the embedded work, and c++ is not used on our projects - and i am somewhat embarrassed to say i've only briefly fooled around with it.<p>my question is this: are there any embedded friendly languages that have some of the same high level features of more interesting languages (e.g., reflection, generic programming, first-class functions, extensive list libraries) that can be compiled without a runtime and strictly without any calls to malloc? are any of these even possible? i've tried sketching out possible solutions to this, but i suspect they may only work in very limited cases. thanks.	2011-08-22 23:03:03 UTC		3	2	[]

357138	ask hn:would you build or use such a service?	if you are a web developer then you have no doubt rolled your eyes more than once at a suggestion by some wannabe entrepreneur like me that you should work on his brilliant idea for equity. we all know what your answer was - naff off or some less polite variation of the phrase. that was certainly the sort of response i got.<p>so now i get it, you developers are the salt of the earth and your time is worth more than any half-baked idea could possibly offer. be that as it may, there is obviously quite some demand for this sort of thing and what follows is a suggestion for how both parties might meet half way.<p>so my idea is for a unique marketplace that brings people with knowledge together with people in search of it. i know there are many of these but this will have the following key differentiators or unique selling points:<p>1.  learning will be project based in that a pupil will be able to propose a project that they wish to accomplish and tutors will bid to guide them through it. my thinking here is that if i want to learn ruby on rails for examples, i may have a project in mind that i want to use it for. i am likely to learn better by working on a project but even more so if that project is my great and brilliant start-up idea. for pupils without project ideas or tutors that prefer to work with their own projects, tutors will also be able to define standard projects that they prefer to use in their lessons.<p>2. pupils and tutors will have the option of paying and accepting payments respectively in equity instead of cash or part equity part cash. the difference between this and the often frowned upon request to work for equity is one of time. it is one thing to be asked to work full time on and take responsibility for developing an application; it is quite another thing to be asked to guide someone through doing it. the difference as i say is one of time i think. the latter should take less time. the tutor will review the project, devise a plan for the pupil and prepare lessons or gather text or relevant examples for each lesson in the plan. basically, the tutor will tell the pupil what to do and offer text, examples and general guidance on how to do it. bids will include how long the tutor thinks the project will take, how much they will charge and how involved they will get etc.<p>3. the marketplace could also offer pupils the option of charging fees back to their employers who will in turn have the ability to approve or reject project proposals as they may want to insist on the projects being of some benefit to the company. this feature would not have to be available at launch if at all but it could help the marketplace gain traction. i envision companies becoming more willing to allow their employees to do side projects and gain knowledge in doing so, as part of their development plans etc. rather than actively market to enterprises though, their employees could do the job for you.<p>so what do you think? is it feasible, would you use it, will you build it (for equity?)? by the way, if you don't buy the pay by equity feature, what do you think of this as a cash-only marketplace? oh and one last thing, the marketplace will of course make money by taking a share in cash payments or a no-loss stake in resulting start-ups for equity payments.<p>so can we build it? yes we can!	2008-11-07 21:55:25 UTC		3	2	[]

<i>2)</i> we made that connection<p>he suggested we meet. my question: should i meet face to face with the ceo of my chief competitor? if so, how do i approach it?<p><i>pros:</i> could get his perspective on industry, have an interesting conversation, make a contact that could potentially help me.<p><i>cons:</i> may inspire preemptive competitive response. i'm not sure its good to alert someone before you throw a brick at them.<p>here are some facts that may or may not be relevant:<p>1) i have a prototype ready, have raised some seed capital and will be raising a bit more shortly. i don't expect to launch the product until at least february. the competitor site is well established with 20m uniques per month.<p>2) they address a different niche in the market, though we overlap some (think macy's versus patagonia). they've positioned themselves for a different portion of the market, and appropriately addressing my niche would cannibalize their bread and butter. but i'd hate to underestimate them.	2010-11-01 21:04:02 UTC		3	4	[]

up until now i was thinking whether i should publish it or not, but considering the fact that it's my b-day today (yeeehuu)...here it is (http://www.echoedd.com). hopefully, someone will find it useful.&#60;p&#62;i'm embarrassed by the design, part of the code. and a few more things.
i know, i know, not everything works, but it will - very soon, but even besides that feel free to be brutally honest and tell me what you think.&#60;p&#62;it's 6a.m. here. time to go to bed...&#60;p&#62;thanks.&#60;p&#62;mladen

2496627	airpush responds to privacy concerns, requires opt-in 	a few weeks ago airpush launched as the world’s first mobile ad network based on push notifications. in that short period, we have had over 5,000 android developers join the platform and developer satisfaction has been overwhelming.<p>over the past few days it has become evident that, despite satisfaction amongst our developers, some end-users have expressed concern about receiving push notification ads without their prior consent.  to date, we have provided developers with a permissions api to implement custom opt-in / opt-out procedures, but we have not made it mandatory.<p>in response to this feedback, we are modifying our sdk to require opt-in from all users prior to delivering push notification ads. the opt-in will appear as a dialog box upon initial launch of the app, and developers will no longer be able to build their own opt-in.  this change will be complete next week.<p>we regret that we didn’t launch airpush with this developer requirement, but we recognize the need to respond swiftly to feedback from the android community. we believe this change will address the concerns of users who don’t want push notification ads.<p>we look forward to continuing our mission of helping android developers achieve dramatically superior earnings via push notification ads.<p>sincerely,<p>asher delug

5120018	ask hn: review my startup, tagthebird	hi everyone,<p>i’ve seen how helpful answers to “ask hn” requests have been in the past, and now that i’ve released the first version of web i’ve been working on, i figured i would make my first post to hn to ask for some feedback from you all.<p>tagthebird is a site where you can do  some things that you can't do on twitter. i copy paste what we say in about us page:<p>we love twitter. we can follow interesting people, but sometimes we do not want to know everything they do in their private lives.<p>on tagthebird users can post tweets from twitter and tag them. users can indicate their interests and can see tweets that match them. this will eliminate "noise" and gives a new perspective: interests.<p>for example, if you like basket and video games, you can indicate this on tagthebird and by clicking on my interests we will show you tweets related to basket and video games.<p>tagthebird gives you the chance to find interesting tweets from users you do not follow.<p>you can see top voted, most commented and most retweeted tweets of the day, week, month, year and all time.<p>you can vote for tweets and you can comment on tweets without having to answer to the author. more than 140 characters are allowed. you can paste a tweet link, an image link or a youtube link.<p>if you are a twitter user, you can know how community values your tweets through the votes, comments and retweets.<p>i’d love to hear what you all think. website is http://www.tagthebird.com/<p>thank you for your feedback.	2013-01-26 10:49:32 UTC		4	2	[]

1908361	a nice function for node.js and v8	i've started thinking about how best to implement a real-time chat server for my platform, and found this:<p>v8 + node.js + socket.io<p>awesome!<p>personally i'd rather be coding in javascript on the server than erlang ... and with google's awesome team behind v8, i think it can be fast enough to handle at least 10k users on one machine! (except of if you are parsing json ... there is a post about that recently, and i think the latest v8 might do it a little better.)<p>a lot of people are wary of using javascript though because you have to write lots of nested callbacks to do things in sequence. well to that i say, let me write a function that sort of does it for you.<p>after writing it, i thought i'd share it here on hacker news ... hopefully it'll help anyone who's writing in node.js<p><pre><code>  me.run = function(callables, onsuccess, onerror) {
	var k=0, len, ret;
	switch (typeof callables) {
	 case 'object':
		ret = {};
		try {
			for (k in callables) {
				if (typeof(callables[k]) === 'array') {
					ret[k] = callables[k][0].apply(callables[1], callables[k].slice(2));
				} else {

				}
			}
			if (onsuccess) {

however, we've never made any money with it and it has stagnated for about a year, in terms of development, because there aren't any incentives to continue to develop it.<p>i'm looking for options, because it's a pitty to just see it exist out of inertia and other people's interest.<p>what would <i>you</i> do with it?

744171	ask hn: edit history for hn comments?	i've noticed a couple of incidents recently of people editing their comments to preemptively respond to replies, and in some cases completely change the meaning of comments that had already been replied to, rather than continuing the conversation. i can't help but feel that this is a dishonest tactic of discussion, one that drives away those who aren't looking to score points.
at one point a comment that had been edited was marked with an asterisk. i also seem to remember that it used to not be possible to edit a comment once it had replies (i am not sure on that). and there has at various points been an informal practice of adding a tagline when an extensive revision was introduced describing the reason for the edit.<p>i know there is a timelimit on editing, which limits the scope of historical revisioning.<p>would adding a history of edits to a given comment make egregious revisions less likely?	2009-08-05 20:22:40 UTC		9	9	[]

6917748	the delusion of social networks	as an entrepreneur, who runs a logistics business, or for that matter, what you may call an &#x27;offline business&#x27;. i have deleted my twitter&#x2f;facebook&#x2f;linkedin&#x2f;goolge+ accounts.<p>i was expecting, i am going to bankrupt or out of business. but &#x27;surprisingly&#x27; nothing has happened.<p>i am not an old-fashioned guy, i am perhaps of the elite of &#x27;early adopters&#x27; just to put emphasis. the kind of guy, who always keep osx&#x2f;ios up to date, and would buy any app that appears here ;) just to summarize.<p>however to my astonishment, the old-fashioned way of getting things done and promoted is far more worthwhile than these stupid things. (social networks).<p>i am more able to put focus on my real job, and while still being better informed. there is no information overload. previously even though i was following 100 blogs on twitter&#x2f;facebook. but truth is, i would barely click any of the links. and i was being deluded, that since i am following all these cool websites, i will be better informed, and that information will help me somehow.<p>now i have bookmarked few sites, and randomly check them 1 or 2 times a day. i get to read couple of articles too which are worth my time.<p>as for social networking, clearly facebook is a failure, it&#x27;s just a show off and you would never know if your friends are actually in good shape and conditions. because everyone just would pretend, he is a billionaire and having the best ever time of their life. but sadly and mostly it&#x27;s not true.<p>you can never know it, until you meet them in person or at least make a phone call, fuck skype too. i don&#x27;t know but skype does not convey true emotions for reasons unknown, perhaps it&#x27;s internet related service, and people still pretend the same way as the do on other internet services like facebook.<p>finally, i am feeling much better and relaxed and more focused on my work. end.	2013-12-16 20:54:42 UTC		12	8	[]

2982818	ask hn: best practices for supporting extensions to your web application?	hey hn,<p>i'm currently modifying my b2b application to allow custom extensions.  after some futile google and so searches, i can't find many best practices or patterns on how to support this.<p>as a quick example, say my application has support for users (exotic, i know).  a company purchases the software and decides they want to store (and display) social security numbers.  any suggestions on how to go about storing custom data in the database?  suggestions on how they modify the app to display data in x spots?<p>i was thinking database-wise, either a column in the users table that stores all extended data, or else somehow update the schema itself.<p>for display, tons and tons of hooks might be the way to go...<p>anyways, i'd be grateful for any tips, hard lessons learned, documents, ebooks, really anything about this.	2011-09-10 23:50:14 UTC		13	8	[]

7464315	ask hn: was everyone's first web development experience extremely difficult?	i started reading hacker news about two years ago (freshman year in college), and i was instantly motivated to start coding. i decided to major in ee, and i&#x27;ve done well in my c&#x2f;c++ programming classes. i also picked up python and r for some work on personal projects.<p>however, almost all of my coding has been limited to the command line. although its been fun, i&#x27;ve been interested in designing a web-app for a while. some of the posts on hacker news make the process sound so easy, so i finally built up the motivation to start.<p>i decided to use python as a backend, since i know that language best. i chose flask as my web framework because it&#x27;s supposed to be one of the simplest frameworks for python. unfortunately, i&#x27;m struggling to understand proper file structure and basic features such as blueprints, forms, models, and controllers. most flask tutorials go over these terms too quickly for me to properly understand them.<p>i wanted to manage users on the web-app, so i needed a database. i picked sqlite. just like with the frameworks, i had to pick a solution without even understanding what the solution was doing. fortunately, sqlite and databases haven’t been as difficult to pick up as flask.<p>to control my web-app’s appearance, i picked up html and css. the tutorials on w3schools were nice, but i couldn&#x27;t imagine building an entire app manually. and then i came across bootstrap! it&#x27;s an extremely helpful framework, but again, it&#x27;s another tool i&#x27;ve had to learn.<p>one feature i wanted was interactive graphs, so i went to javascript. codecademy helped me with the syntax, and i eventually found the highcharts library. this has been the easiest tool to learn due to their comprehensive documentation.<p>learning these tools individually is tough. making them work together is even tougher. the posts on hacker news make the web development process seem so easy. was everyone&#x27;s first experience this rough?	2014-03-25 06:56:53 UTC		13	16	[]

2753397	the 76 minute mba	i am a recent mba grad currently working on an education start up.<p>this lecture was filmed in 2009.  i learned more from this (highly entertaining) video than from graduate school.<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmclxx5msc<p>the lecturer is peter schiff - most famous for predicting the dot com bubble and the housing bubble.<p>there are several themes in this lecture you guys may find interesting and relevant:<p>-sustainable businesses make decisions based on current and future cash flow.  real estate and tech are no different<p>-bubbles are predictable<p>-keynesian economics (low interest rates, stimulus, money printing, bailouts, subsidies, fannie mae and freddie mac) fuels bubbles<p>-the 'boom' is the problem, the 'bust' is the solution
-moral hazard (too big too fail) is not conducive to prudent, long term decision making<p>-when it comes to frothy markets, "this time is different" is not an advisable mentality<p>i hope this serves as an introduction to austrian economics and a wake up call to those who ignore the powerful effects loose monetary policy.	2011-07-12 03:21:07 UTC		17	5	[]

2937385	some thoughts about the hp touchpad	you know hn, after some thoughts, i think the media was behind the failure of the hp touchpad before it got discounted. i don't remember seeing hp market the touchpad as the "ipad killer", the media did. the public didn't feel like it was an ipad killer.<p>i now wonder how the story would have turned if they just mentioned it as just another tablet? hp touchpad would have been another tablet, another choice, like sony playstation 3 to nintendo wii. not a single news source would ever say, ok, nintendo just released console x the sony console x killer. they know in their right mind that they are just choices.<p>it's time for the media to put some thought about the message they are sending the wide public.	2011-08-29 15:00:36 UTC		1	0	[]

6438727	startup fundraising review	when i bought my first company (an existing franchise) we were shocked at the process from the buyers perspective. what people asked for, and what they were willing to take was not even close. we are not talking like houses or cars, that is piddly - more like a 50% swing.<p>we eventually found a resource that showed us p&amp;l numbers, sales prices and what it eventually sold for, on about a thousand small businesses. it validated what we were seeing.<p>which brings me to today, i am starting into the process of raising money for my startup and am wondering if such a resource exists.<p>how much money was the startup asking for?
how many angels did they talk to?
how many made an offer?
how far from the ask, was the offer?<p>does such a knowledge base exist anywhere?	2013-09-24 16:05:44 UTC		1	0	[]

2095264	subscribe to news sources with your kindle&ipad - doggy style	i would like to pick your brain and offer a hopefully useful service at the same time.<p>on http://readbeam.com/ i have cobbled together basically a hosted version of calibre.
this allows you to either request news sources manually or have them sent to you on a schedule e.g: get me the new york times every morning at 6 and mail it automagically to my kindle - like having your dog fetch the paper automatically.<p>the site is currently neither beautiful nor comfortable. please give it a spin and let me know what you think. please be gentle when requesting many sources on a frequent schedule, this is quite computing intensive and may bog down or crash the system. if the site is down please check back a few hours later. i have upgraded the instance but i know the hackernews effect can be brutal sometimes.<p>i chose to compile all the recipes on github.com (https://github.com/readbeam/recipes), for all git users out there, this may be helpful.<p>i am especially interested on your views about all the copyright or other legal issues i may face here. my current understanding is - basically - that the manual fetch should be ok, because one person is manually requesting a copy of a site - like when you request a site with your browser and maybe have an adblocker installed.<p>i hope the subscription service is legal as well, because not i am serving the recipes, but the user is. so my line of thought is: i am just offering a hosting platform with an api, you are programming it and doing something 'bad' (accessing e.g. the economist.com site, that is). so it's again you doing the scraping...<p>but i don't know if this holds water, please let me know what you think.<p>thanks for your time,<p>tom<p>p.s. for now it's mobi only, if there is enough demand, i will add epub support later.	2011-01-12 06:50:17 UTC		1	0	[]

4193315	ask hn: this is how google could make ios native mail app open links in chrome	okay, this is just an idea, and in the end only gmail people can implement this, but i wouldn't be surprised that some googlers are visiting hn every now and then so i thought i would give it a stab here:<p>so, everybody knows that apple doesn't (and likely will never) allow to choose a default browser on ios other than safari.
i am somewhat a fan of some alternative browsers like icabmobile and of course the brand new chrome (among some others) so it is really a pain to be dragged down to safari (which is still quite decent, don't get me wrong) every time you click on a link somewhere. this is especially true in mail.<p>of course, there are solutions when you jailbreak and i've done it before but this is not exactly mainstream, and you're back to square one whenever there's a new device that can't be jailbroken usually for months.<p>so i've thought about a different approach: you probably know about the bookmarklet trick that opens safari's current page in chrome (or others) by basically replacing the 'http' prefix by 'googlechrome'.<p>that got me thinking: what if the mail provider (say gmail) would apply the same trick to each link in the emails it serves to ios devices? you could choose in your gmail settings which default browser you want your links to be opened with and that would be it!<p>at the moment, ios devices point to the 'm.google.com' server but it sounds easy enough to use instead something like 'ios.google.com' to target ios devices only, with the modified prefixes.
and you keep the ability to easily manage your email as usual (archiving, using folders/labels, etc) the exact way you already do (which wouldn't be as easy by developing some sort of proxy server you would forward your mail to like some 3rd party notification services used to do).<p>i know, easier said than done, and i'm maybe overlooking some blatant issue (aside from apple being probably pissed off by the trick) but from my point of view that would be a cool way to bring back a bit of choice here...<p>your thoughts?	2012-07-03 09:56:10 UTC		1	0	[]

8470631	show hn: lectito, a speed reader for windows phone	i am a big speed reading fan, especially the idea of being able to use rapid serial visualization presentation (rsvp) on a phone.<p>the idea behind rsvp is that it takes a considerable amount of effort and time to move your eyes&#x27; focus from word to word when you are reading, especially on a phone where the font might be tiny. because of this you can increase immensely your reading speed if instead of having to move your focus from word to word, you focus on a point and the word changes at a certain cadence. typically, with some practice you can increase that cadence to numbers such as 500 words per minute comfortably, which is a lot more than what the average person can read and works brilliantly if you read light stuff (i wouldn&#x27;t use it for hard technical stuff, because you need more time to process the information for it to make sense).<p>i looked for speed reading apps for wp8 and found a few, but they required you to either copy&amp;paste the text you want to speed read, required the text to be in onedrive or that you&#x27;d copy the url of the page you wanted to speed read.<p>so i did lectito (it means reading in latin): http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.windowsphone.com&#x2f;en-us&#x2f;store&#x2f;app&#x2f;lectito&#x2f;c4f00daf-d815-4868-8e65-a55ae40708e2<p>lectito can be &quot;launched&quot; from internet explorer using the sharing option and it also supports pictures (it will display them and their &quot;alt&quot; text), which was another feature lacking in all the apps i&#x27;ve tried.<p>i&#x27;m still adding features and making stuff better in general. i&#x27;d really appreciate feedback in terms of features&#x2f;problems that the app might still have.<p>all of the code that is not ui related is pcl, so it isn&#x27;t too hard to port it to other platforms. i&#x27;ve chosen windows phone because that&#x27;s the phone i have now (lumia 920 and i really like it, especially the camera), and because i thought it would be the mobile platform where the market is less saturated.<p>thanks!

2615500	why to be excited for the xoon over the galaxy tabs	after doing tons of research on the galaxy tabs that are going to be released shortly i have already decided that the xoom is better and it's very simple why.<p>google is a great company who makes unmatchable software. i'm not saying samsung makes crap products, in fact i'd say all of the hardware manufacturers makes pretty good phones and tablets.<p>hardware producers, should produce hardware, and leave the coding to google. the galaxy tabs "features" software that samsung made. earth to samsung, you make fantastic hardware, you should spend more of your resources on better hardware and less software. if not, use those resources to make better drivers if you're so concerned with software. believe it or not drivers can make huge differences with user experience. anyways, i have yet to buy an android tablet and it will probably be a xoom because from the looks the hardware specs look roughly the same, the difference is that the xoom is untouched by motorola, which makes it a better tablet.<p>keep in mind i also know that the tabs will have 3.1 and the xoom is on 3.0, that's how strongly i feel about manufacturers touching software that they shouldn't touch.	2011-06-03 07:38:49 UTC		1	1	[]

7602632	ask hn: when can you call yourself a "successful entrepreneur"?	what makes an entrepreneur successful?<p>i struggle with this daily.<p>i started my career with a 9-5 job for 6 years in high-tech bioengineering sales.  while working, a friend and i worked on a blog, which turned into some info-products that have, to date, grossed about $500k (though my take-home over 4-5 years is more in the $100k range).<p>i quit my job after 6 years, and launched my own online product and sold 250 sales within 6 months, and the product continues to sell on its own...but i have only pulled about $12k from this product so far (though it continues to sell and grow each month with little effort).<p>while this was all going on, i also picked up several one-off $2k-$3k clients and generated about $20k over 2 years for these jobs.<p>now, i am trying to step my game up and get clients who sell products for $10k-$20k&#x2f;unit.  in my sales packages and copy, i want to say i am a successful entrepreneur, but i struggle with this on a psychological level.<p>first off, i am nowhere near my goals (that&#x27;s why i am stepping up my business to higher value clients)...so how can i really say i am successful?<p>secondly, my expertise in internet marketing has helped me sell services in the 2-3k range, and products in the $35-$100, but never something in the $10-20k range.  how can i seriously call myself a success if my successes don&#x27;t align with the idea of success i am trying to sell my clients?<p>maybe this is all psychological, but i would be interested in hearing the opinions of other consultants&#x2f;entrepreneurs...	2014-04-17 09:14:47 UTC		1	2	[]

3702804	what to do with my life?(study)	hi,<p>within 2 months i need to decide what i'm going to study for the next 3.5 years and probably be doing the rest of my life.
i want to choose programming, but it gives me that overwhelming feeling of never be able to understand it or keep up with the speed it's going. 
how do i know, if i  am able to be a good programmer?<p>i already did a "programming" education but it was so easy, that afterwards, i didn't had the feeling i learned something or was ready to work as a programmer.
the education i did is a lower education than the one i'm going to do, but i don't want  the feeling  afterwards that i'm not a programmer again ,because where i live this is normal the last education which you have before you start working.<p>so, what should i do, to find out if i'm cut out for being a programmer? and maybe other tips or things i should know before trying to start a career as a programmer?<p>and what about this: http://www.halfsigma.com/2007/03/why_a_career_in.html 
i got a bit scared reading it, but how true is it?<p>kind regards,<p>gup<p>p.s. a question for dutch people: which school do you recommend? (hbo)	2012-03-14 12:20:37 UTC		2	1	[]

1117062	ask hn: please re-review my webapp: playlistr	the last version seemed to be fairly well-received, but it wasn't satisfied with it, yet. since i last posted about it, i've made a few changes. the most obvious would be the interface. i'm not sure if anyone who commented on my previous thread has seen the new interface, but it's much easier on the eyes.<p>most of the changes are on the backend, but are ones i'm sure a lot of you would appreciate. i've added a proper admin panel, so adding new streams is a snap. (feel free to request some!) i've also made the playlists generate with titles, so they won't show up in your media player as a list of ugly ip addresses and hostnames. they also use crlf now, instead of just lf.<p>you may also login (link is under the logo) using your google account and your selections will be saved for you, then restored on your next visit.<p>http://playlistr.appspot.com	2010-02-11 06:23:46 UTC		2	1	[]

325425	ask hn: is there a state-by-state guide to ip assignment issues that affect startups?	i've been talking with some friends about doing a startup, but there's a concern about the potential ip minefield we might be encounter.  in short, one of us has a contract with a software company that makes an extremely aggressive rights grab.  according to the contract, all work done by this person, even outside of work hours and without using any company resources, becomes the property of the company.  this seems like it might be overly broad, but i'm not a lawyer and i know that the law varies considerably from state to state.<p>is there a resource somewhere online that discusses the issues in state ip/employment law for startups?  for example, i've heard that non-compete clauses are unenforceable in california, and a clause like that described above would be unenforceable in minnesota.  something like a table showing the differences would be great.<p>alternatively, since the usual response is "talk to a lawyer," can anybody recommend a competent yet affordable-enough-for-a-bootstrapped-startup attorney who could answer similar questions?  i'm particularly interested in the law for california, minnesota, and new york.  thanks!	2008-10-06 22:52:11 UTC		2	1	[]

2040245	advice for a computer science sophomore in college?	hi everyone!<p>i'm a sophomore in college majoring in computer science and math. i have always loved programming. i started programming in c when i was nine years old and over the years i've picked up visual basic, c#, java, c++, javascript, objective-c, python, ruby, elementary haskell and elementary erlang, and i learned perl back in the day which i've mostly forgotten.<p>i have not done much network programming. i have done cgi programming, but that was about six/seven years ago. i've done some socket programming and written (school) programs to do interprocess communication, which i understood and liked. i'm taking a course on client/server programming and another one on network security next semester, which i am really looking forward to.<p>i'm seeking advice on how to proceed with future learning. i've mostly done application (mobile and desktop) development, not much of web development. i'd like to pick up some web development this coming semester. since i know ruby and python, should i start by learning django and/or rails? any other suggestions on starting web development? i have a good understanding of html and css.<p>also, i'd also like to know how hard it is to pick up and be good (read: productive) in functional programming languages coming from a purely structured/object oriented background? i've been reading up on erlang and haskell, and i'd like to know your opinions on whether it's worth my time trying to learn them. what about lisp, scheme and other functional languages?<p>any help/ideas would be really appreciated.	2010-12-26 07:19:10 UTC		2	2	[]

2624596	ask hn: soon-to-be cs graduate. best resources for finding decent job.	i'm currently positioned to graduate from my cs major this december. it's from a state school and is abet certified. i really love to program and enjoy learning as much as possible about different coding techniques as well as getting really in-depth with the details around programming.<p>that being said, i'm currently on the lookout to try and find a job once i graduate. i'd like to have something lined up by the end of summer. i'm for sure planning to relocate (preferably to the sf bay area). i've been an entrepreneur my entire life, but am ready to trade that in so that i can focus on learning as much about programming as possibly without the extra headaches of running your own business. i've spent a lot of effort to learn and effectively use most of the web based technologies, as well as the standard desktop programming languages (c++, c#, java, etc.)<p>so far, i've been searching for jobs on dice and monster, searched through some on craigslist, and have been networking with anyone i know, and whom those people know, to find people in companies that would allow to get my foot in the door.<p>i've applied directly on some of the bigger companies web sites (google, apple, etc.), but am still waiting to hear something back. i'm married and have a young child, so some amount of stability within the company at the moment would be nice, but not absolutely necessary as i've survived this long without much financial stability.<p>any help / advice would be much appreciated.<p>thanks.

7974667	what problems are there to be solved for developers?	i&#x27;d like to start a side project, something targeting the developer community (because i think i have a cool domain name!)<p>this might not sound like a right approach. some might say &quot;you should know the problem already and you should be &#x27;living&#x27; the problem yourself!&quot;<p>yeah ok. sometimes you just don&#x27;t know because you just don&#x27;t know. :) plus, that&#x27;s why i called it a &quot;side project&quot;. something not too big to tackle on my spare time and hopefully solve a problem at the same time.<p>anyway, &quot;problems for developers&quot; is quite a large domain... i can think of<p>- recruitment (a number of discussions and ideas on dev recruitment)

2661429	are founders of profitable bootstrapped companies the free citizen model?	i’ve been playing around with this thesis for a while because it appears to me that not having intermediaries makes you free from:
1. the pressure of stakeholders
2. their unclear/unpredictable? intentions (risk?)
3. their politics and all sort of things that doesn't help you to stay connected with the audience (or at least not for the right reasons.)<p>when i think of founders of bootstrapped profitable companies i see people that can really express their ideas differently from other people. regardless what the law (and ultimately the constitution) say about everybody, they are effectively more free than other people.<p>some days ago derek sivers blogged about the “home” concept[1] and it made me think about this question. actually, his story is kind of an example of this model. then, when he asked for questions [2] i’ve asked him this one and he told me he’s <i>very</i> interested in writing about it (i hope he does!)<p>so the next thing i think about all this is the social role of startups for democracy. with more citizens like this one should have a civilization of more effectively free people.<p>this has huge consequences. startups of this kind are way more interesting than simple personal wealth creation.<p>do you guys perceive this too or i’m using too much imagination?<p>[1] "there's no place like home" http://sivers.org/homeless

4339134	open source 3d pie menus for unity3d	i've made free open source pie menus for unity3d! i'll write some documentation and more demos soon, and put it on the unity3d app store. here's a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smn1lq7qx9g here's the source code: http://www.donhopkins.com/home/piemenudemo/piemenudemo.zip&#60;p&#62;they're written in c#, and support text items, image items, and 3d object items too! i've tried to make it general purose and easy to build pie menus and integrate them into your own applications.&#60;p&#62;here's a silly demo, showing a set of simcity pie menus:
http://www.donhopkins.com/home/piemenudemo/piemenudemo.html&#60;p&#62;they have a full set of useful notifiers so you can tightly integrate them with your application to give rich feedback during tracking (for example, modifying the 3d menu items, or previewing the effect of the menu item and distance parameter in real time, making them more like "direct manipulation").&#60;p&#62;for example, to show how you can implement feedback like the sims pie menus with the head in the center that looks at the selected item, i've made a 3d object in the pie menu center with the webcam texture on it, so your head is in the center of the menu, looking at the selected item! (that's why the demo asks for permission to use the webcam.)&#60;p&#62;the pie menu and each item has a title as well as a description. one feature i've added is the ability not only to disable an item, but also to provide an explanation of why the item is disabled! (pacman in the demo is disabled, for example.) i wish other menus and widgets would do that -- it's frustrating when you can find an item you want, but can't figure out why it's disabled!&#60;p&#62;another nice thing about them is that you can either configure algorithmically with an api, or with json data (which makes it easy to make dynamic data driven menus downloaded from a server or database), or construct them in the unity3d editor out of objects (which makes it easier for artists to design them)!	2012-08-04 18:05:47 UTC	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMN1LQ7qx9g	3	1	[]

9014206	makeschool admissions policy: the beginning of institutionally supported ageism?	on their admissions and faq page [1], the following may be found:<p>&quot;what age do i have to be?<p>our typical student is aged 18-25, 18 is the minimum age (for legal reasons) but there&#x27;s no upper age. whether you have a cs degree and want to beef up your skills or you&#x27;re a high school grad and want to jump into your career, you should apply!&quot;<p>[1] https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.makeschool.com&#x2f;admissions<p>startups in the valley have a documented problem with ageism (sexism too, but let&#x27;s stick to one issue at a time for now). makeschool is not an employer, so the same rules about age discrimination do not apply for their admissions. they say that there is no upper limit for admissions. however, by explicitly providing an age range like this, it gives the impression that it will be difficult for older students to be accepted, and that they may feel out of place if they were accepted. it easily intimidates them from applying in the first place.<p>as makeschool is trying to position themselves as a kind of talent pipeline into the start-up ecosystem with their partners&#x2f;investors, this feels like the beginning of institutionally supported ageism in the hiring process. makeschool is funded and&#x2f;or partners with some of the biggest names in town, who also support a lot of other companies. if these companies start saying that they only take graduates from this program or programs like it... well, it all seems set up to exclude otherwise talented people discovered their love of programming or entrepreneurship after the age of 25.<p>i just really don&#x27;t like seeing a recommended age range on a program for which there is no practical reason to do so. people can learn a new skill at any point in their life, not just their late teens or early 20s.	2015-02-07 15:28:10 UTC		3	2	[]

2805729	ask hn: investment tracking web app	i'm a member of a private(you have to pay a fee in order to get in) investment forum, where entrepreneurs have the possibility to publish projects and the members can invest in them.<p>tracking the projects in the forum is difficult and messy, especially for the people who publish projects(they waste a lot of time looking trough different threads). this produces a lot of communication problems so i think the forum doesn't fit to do this task. some examples:<p>- it's pretty hard to measure things about the project.<p>- sharing private information.<p>- pending requests for information, confirmation...<p>- if an investor is interested in a project he has to post in a "project investors list thread". this always causes at least two problems: an investor forgets to add the previous entered on the list and someone has to fix it, some investors don't want to appear in the list, so they send a private message to the project manager, and then the project manager has to update the list.<p>so i'm thinking about building an app to solve this problem and i'd like to know if there are already similar apps in the market. i've made a search but i couldn't find something similar.<p>i'd also like to ask you what do you think about the idea, i'm improving the problems list and then i'll begin making some mockups before customer validation. pricing the app wouldn't(there are different ways to charge for the product) be easy but a nice thing is that i'll charge a minimum amount of the money a project receives.<p>thanks for your help and sorry for my bad english. please let me know if there's something you don't understand.	2011-07-26 02:33:33 UTC		4	0	[]

9285340	ask hn: how to find devs for feedback in london	i&#x27;m working on a new website builder, aimed at developers, and i wanted sit down with devs to get feedback (invite them for a coffee).
i talked to almost every developer i know and they all loved it (subscribed for free beta), now i wanted to get feedback from strangers.
i just moved to london for work so i barely know anyone here. i set out to talk to 100 strangers. with a pace of 1 stranger a week, it would take 2 years.<p>any ideas would be great on how to shorten this time.
if you are in london and would enjoy a coffee with me, that would be double great.	2015-03-29 16:10:36 UTC		4	4	[]

3188020	i want to get unplugged for 1 year (365 days)	lately it seems i been making myself inundated with too much information.  whenever i need to procrastinate, i will find myself web surfing or needing to read something.  i find myself, losing the ability to focus, think creatively, and be able to critically think effective.  it's like ideas are put into my head from surfing various websites and discussions.<p>i want to do an experiment to see what it's like to be unplugged for 1 year.  of course i realize i can't be unplugged from everything.  but i want to at least do the following.<p>1.)stop reading online news and browsing social news sites.<p>2.)stop going to any website, if it's not a website to either check my mail, pay my bills, or have a question that i already have answered.<p>3.)not buy an new electronic devices/toys, and not keep up with, same old when is this new gizmo coming out.<p>4.)not download/purchase any new software apps, music, etc.<p>5.)not try to research any new programming/database/web app technologies.<p>6.)not reading any books or magazines, unless they are direct reference materials for some problem i am trying to solve.<p>however i do want to<p>1.)keep up with my fitness goals.  i use gymgoal for the iphone, it's the best app i have found that works for me for body building.<p>2.)really learn the technologies i am interested now.  learn it so well i can start pointing out the flaws in each tool.
ios development, nosql databases (redis,hbase,mongodb, and cassandra),learning ruby,python,c,c++,erlang,javascript,x86 and arm assembly, truly well, build a web app using ror and nodejs, and build and server on local machines as well as the cloud.<p>3.)keeping up with/maintaining and building upon , relationships that i already have with friends and family.<p>4.)using whatever tools/software i have to the fullest,learning the minute details of each.<p>this for me will be an exercise in not only self control, but also how my view of the world will change if it does so.<p>i want thoughts to come to my head naturally; not being spoon feed through blogs, social web sites.<p>so i will keep track of this every day. i will bookmark this post and pretty much update for 1 year, every day.<p>----------------------------<p>day 0:	2011-11-02 17:50:01 UTC		5	1	[]

36587	the value of friend-raising	during my last trip to the bay area, i visited with foundread's carleen hawn. when carleen asked me what i was up to, i explained that i was buried in back-to-back meetings with folks around town discussing my current project, go big network. "are you fund-raising?" she asked, to which i responded: "no, i'm friend-raising!" i wasn't kidding. i was on a mission to make as many new friends as possible.<p>you see, our company's growth isn't only dependent on finding more cash; but it is dependent on us meeting more people. and frankly, i've always found "raising friends" is far more valuable than raising money.<p>the monetary value of a friend
for the sake of this argument, let's set aside the fact that true friendships aren't really about money. but in a business context we're probably not talking about true friendships at all. we're talking about building relationships with people who can help grow your business; put another way, people whom you would otherwise have to pay money to meet.<p>for example, you could take some of your vc funding and hire a business development executive to go out and build new partnerships on behalf of your company, and to extend to your operations with his or her existing rolodex of "friends." but, you'd be "purchasing" those relationships and deals x to the tune of about $100,000 in annual salary for the biz dev executive.<p>now imagine that this same biz dev exec is a friend of yours. instead of shelling out six figures in cash, he or she simply would make the same introductions for you as a favor. in this case, the value received is exactly the same, but the cost to you is zero.<p>so while many entrepreneurs spend most of their time ingratiating themselves with vcs in order to collaterally gain access to useful people, i figure out who those useful people are first, and then spend all my time trying to meet them myself.<p>this is what i mean when i say i swap fund-raising for friend-raising.<p>wait a minute! isn't that just "networking?"
okay, sure it is. it's networking. it's business development. sometimes it means pretending that the people i meet at a cocktail party aren't as important to my business as they are, and so forth. it's all of those things, but more importantly, it's recognizing that money typically buys relationships in an indirect way. it's also recognizing that the more relationships i build, the less money i need.<p>my friendship-development plan
you've heard of a "business development plan". it's a series of targets and milestones that execs use to grow their sales efforts. i've worked on bd plans for ten different companies, and in every case, it was ultimately about creating relationships.<p>when i realized this, i shifted my focus to the friendship development plan. i laid out all of the relationships that i would need to have x everyone from investors and advisors to bloggers and customers. then i created milestones or targets, focused on a few people whom i would try to build a relationship with along a specific timeline.<p>i divided the list of friend prospects into strategic categories. for example, i knew go big would need a voice in the blogging community, so i set out to build relationships with the folks at gigaom (parent of found|read), venturebeat, and techcrunch. i've now written for all four of these sites!<p>by simply picking up the phone and forging relationships with om, matt and mike directly, i avoided needing to pay some pr agency a $10,000-a-month retainer for the same benefit.<p>getting serious about friend-raising
most founders know that they need to network more, but they still don't do it. yet inexplicably, entrepreneurs happily devote countless hours to courting the gods of venture capital.<p>if you could take all the time and energy you've spent courting capital and express it in terms of "useful resources purchased," i think you'd find that getting serious about "friend-raising" is the more economical proposition.<p>your plan to build friends won't ever be as quantitative as a tradtional sales planxin which it is possible to tie new customer relationships directly to receivables. don't be so callous as to try to equate every new friend to a dollar figure (which is just weird). quantify it this way: as the total value of time and energy you save in terms of the fund-raising you no longer need to do_.<p>in go big's case, by taking all the time and energy that might have gone into fund-raising and refocusing it on building relationships ourselves with the media, customers, partners, and talent, we avoided taking a first round of capital. i can't say how much any one of these friend-relationships is worth in simple dollars, but i do know that we skipped raising what otherwise would have been a $2 million a-round. and go big did just fine.<p>of course, now that i've said all this, i'm probably get a bill from carleen. but it still will have been worth it.	2007-07-25 14:50:50 UTC	http://www.foundread.com/view/the-value-of-friend	5	1	[]

7439721	after business consulting, i want to get back into development. where to start?	after doing coding all through university, and then programming professionally for a few years, i decided to make a switch into business consulting.<p>most of this experience was all through linux using java, c, c++ and some 4gl work for mining companies.<p>i&#x27;m starting to get hungry for coding again, and am wondering what some of the better starting points would be for the type of modern web development employers are looking for these days.<p>this is not necessarily for moving out of consulting, but skilling up in areas that are relevant these days.<p>would it be correct to say these are the areas i should be looking into?<p>javascript&#x2f;html5&#x2f;css3

5081335	ask hn: how to not lose yourself in perfectionism creating a developer profile?	i guess i'm doing what most people did before the rise of blogs, github and social media. stuff whatever i wrote in some folder, have code rot on some hard drive and receive mail to my yahoo address ending in four numbers and just hope the interviewer solely relies on employment history.<p>that doesn't fly these days. maybe i'm taking everything too serious, but leaving some kind of mark on the internet seems so complicated and doesn't allow for experimentation. everything is connected somehow and often it's impossible to change things you're not so happy about.<p>i did a lot of commits and bug reports with throwaway accounts and mails. contributing things anonymous is still a good thing, but somehow feels wrong and doesn't add anything to how people perceive my skill or character.<p>here's one chain of thought:<p>"i should really put my code online. i set the maila dress in my git repository to "&#60;&#62;" but i can still change that now, but not later. well i can't use tomatonose384@yahoo.com but every good name is already in use, so what to do? maybe i should get a domain first. damn, every good name is already in use. but i can't commit now because people might end up relying on my commit history or even fork it before i can change it, if i ever come up with something better. forget about that first, what about my writings? static pages on github are cheap, oh wait we run into the same problem. and what if we ever move to our own webspace, urls will be doomed! well, could get some webspace, need a domain anyway. <i>hundred cups of coffee later</i> that domain sounds dumb, that one's taken...
think of a user name instead. that's what people might end up calling you and you need one on github. damn that's even harder! screw the whole thing, i'd rather write more code."<p>i don't know whether i end up as the artist who's parents find a lot of paintings in the attic after his dead and finds universal praise, or the one who's work just end up in the trash can. but that whole attic thing will definitely happen. it sounds crazy in a way.<p>has anyone else had that problem, or still has? what to do?	2013-01-18 22:05:18 UTC		5	2	[]
2992135	show hn: groupcommute.com - office carpooling made easy	this is my first attempt at a web app to service people that i don't know. this all start a couple years ago when i really wanted to organize carpools at my office but the software either was open to the public or cost lots of money to host for yourself.<p>after watching office hours with pg yesterday, i just thought, what is holding me back from telling people about this.. it is not as polished as i would like but it is an incremental job now.<p>group commute is a free service that allows office workers, those mon-fri nine-to-fivers, to easily create and organize carpools. the groups are invitation only, so you will be riding with people you know.<p>it works like this:<p>- sign-up via the "create group" link below.
- enter your details and the destination details (i.e. the office).
- we will send you a private link to invite your co-workers.
- your co-workers can join the site too, and we will match people based on their routes to the office.<p>please let me know what you think.	2011-09-13 16:23:02 UTC		5	3	[]

we believe in continuous regression testing. we are sure that continuous app validation reduces downtime and helps avoid disasters. qabot uses real browser and gets the monitoring as close as possible to real usage. at it's core, qabot is based on selenium, an open source web browser automation tool. when we say monitoring, we mean more than checking http statuses and response times, we mean continuous validation of web apps, of rules defined by you using selenium ide.<p>to get started you need an account and a valid selenium ide test case (*.html file). once it's uploaded we'll run it for you and notify if anything goes wrong.<p>url: http://qabot.net<p>thank you.	2013-03-07 18:32:53 UTC		7	6	[]

908645	splitting from my business partner - my journey in self esteem	this is the story of my personal journey and my relationship with my business partner.  our business is still alive and solvent, but i've moved on.  even though i'll be throwing away 2 years worth of work, writing off a significant amount of cash, and having to start from scratch again i strongly believe i'll be better off starting again.<p>the business partnership started off great.  we tried a few ideas (all of which could have been grown into something good i believe), and then we settled on our first (and only) real moneymaker.<p>we were from different backgrounds – he had the gift of the gab, was an amazing salesman in some areas, had experience and boldness.  he was bankrupt, but that was no problem as i wasn't borrowing money off him (warning sign?).  i was an intelligent but inexperienced techy, who needed a bit of a confidence boost.  the early days of the partnership worked out great as we complimented each others strengths and weaknesses really well.<p>we built this organically, never over-stretching ourselves.  i quit my day job, and my partner took the same wage as me.  he didn't quit his work as he had substantial financial commitments, but he could do his work outside of our business hours.  (warning sign?)<p>the friction started as we became a little larger.  we were pulling in $10-15k a month, but all of it other than our ramen wage got spent.  larger offices, unneeded staff, lots of advertising.  basically the money all went into making us look good, and saving our time.  a lot of the costs could have been saved by being us founders being more hands-on, and i always wanted to cut costs, but let most of the spendings go ahead.<p>our next project was to copy a franchise idea we'd seen that we could do at a fraction of the cost.  the only problem with this was that the franchise was a dud in the first place – it's so important to do your own research.  once we'd pulled the plug on this (never an easy decision), we moved onto our next project.  more frivolous spending, and here's the painful bit.  we figured we needed investment and a larger space.  my business partner borrowed a large amount, and i personally guaranteed a property lease which was a similar commitment.<p>as you may have guessed, we then set about spending all this money with great haste, only slowing  down as we ran out of money.  as this was going on, i was building the new business almost single-handedly, working ever hour i could.  eventually enough got to be enough.  i was putting my whole life into the business, i'd loaned it an additional money and forsaken wages so that i was in debt, and while i could see the way forwards my business partner was not bringing anything helpful to the table.  the last straw was money that had been promised as a loan to the business by my business partner went to pay for his personal spending.<p>it's now been 6 months since i quit.  the first month was spent working at a good speed, building a new business (that i ultimately never did much with).  the next 3 months were spent sat on my ass, and the last 2 months have been spent working for someone else.  if i were to go through another bad time like this again, i'd have bitten the bullet and taken a job much sooner, as i believe that it's this that really pulled me back onto my feet.  i'm now starting to get the fire back into my belly, and am ready to start my next adventure.<p>what i've learned from this is that i knew for a long time that the partnership wasn't right, and that the business wasn't going in the direction i wanted to take it.  i should never have let things slide and let my business partner take financial decisions i wasn't happy with.  the business would either have been much stronger, or we'd have split apart much earlier if i'd been stronger.  i should also have trusted in myself and my own ability much more, rather than deferring to my more experienced business partner or our advisers.  never let anyone else make the big decisions for you.  being an entrepreneur is about leading, about creating something new, and making something big.	2009-10-28 20:07:40 UTC		9	1	[]

2147590	netbeans discontinues rails support	the below text went out to the mailing list this morning. a sad day for rails...i've always felt thenetbeans support was top notch.<p>--------------<p>dear netbeans community:
after thorough consideration, we have taken
the difficult step to discontinue support for ruby on rails in the
netbeans ide. two main issues underpin this decision:
java se 7
and java development kit 7 (jdk 7) are the next major releases of the
java se platform, which oracle is committed to deliver in 2011. a key
objective of the netbeans ide has always been to offer superior support
for the java platform. to maintain that objective and capitalize on the
jdk 7 release themes--multi-language support, developer productivity
and performance--it is necessary that our engineering resources are
committed to a timely and quality release of netbeans ide 7.0.
second:
although our ruby support has historically been well received, based on
existing low usage trends we are unable to justify the continued
allocation of resources to support the feature.
as of january 27,
the ruby on rails module will be gone from development builds of
netbeans ide 7.0. developers who want to continue to use ruby on rails
functionality in the netbeans ide should please visit the netbeans ruby support page &#60;http://wiki.netbeans.org/rubysupport&#62; for
details on how to do so going forward.
we
remain committed to delivering a first-class product to our community
of developers and users, and we encourage your feedback on our mailing
lists and forums &#60;http://www.netbeans.org/community/lists/top.html&#62;, on twitter &#60;http://twitter.com/netbeans&#62;,
or by writing to us &#60;http://netbeans.org/about/contact.html&#62;.
thank you for your continued support of netbeans.

3591832	ask hn: i'm motivated to do my 10,000+ hours, but...	i need help!<p>i'm 24 years old and, fwiw, i've earned a bs with honors in computer science (summa cum laude) from a large public us university. software engineering is my career, foss is my hobby, and -- as my wife painstakingly exclaims -- something computer-related seems to be on my mind at all times. i've approximately 3 hours per weekday to myself, but i haven't yet produced anything of which to be proud. when i try to take advantage of my free time, i often feel what i can best describe as "hacker's paralysis": a hacker's inability to decide if his/her free time is best spent hacking or learning; e.g., hacking chicken scheme vs. reading sicp. (this problem is compounded by personal issues i'm working through[1], but that's off-topic for hn.) it kills my productivity and causes me to waste ridiculous amounts of time.<p>how do i break through this "hacker's paralysis"?<p>[1] adhd and ocd (which, surprisingly, have a comorbidity rate higher than what one would expect).	2012-02-14 21:16:03 UTC		10	6	[]

5593481	ask hn: company not paying salary on time, what to do?	it's been 2 months since i joined a local startup.
i joined the company at the end of january. 
for the first month, i got my salary during the very start of march, 
that too on forcibly mailing and chatting with the company.
now, for the second month it was delayed for 17 days before i got the salary. as an employee, i would want to quit the company based on these problems and would like to quit as soon as possible without serving notice period. 
now, i'm being threatened from the employer saying he can sue me for not serving my notice period. 
it states in the offer letter that,
"your services shall be terminable by either party giving the other two months’ notice. company may, however, reduce this notice period at its discretion by accepting basic salary in lieu thereof."
so, based on the statement the company can take the salary for the current month and relieve me, if i'm not wrong.
however, offer letter sent was sent to me as a soft copy to my mail during the start, nothing practically signed. even at that point, to get the offer letter from the company, i had to mail them constantly to get one.
so, the director of the company is using abusive words on me and threatening me for my relieving.
just wanted to know, what are the legal protection i can get?	2013-04-23 05:44:14 UTC		10	12	[]
3857869	ask hn: on finding ideas and "scratching my own itch"	hi hn, i'm trying to figure out what saas i'm going to build on the side. but as a self-funded single founder with no marketing budget, i want to go in a niche where<p>a) i will be the user and familiar on what the features will be and<p>b) i will have a chance to at least go level with the competition.<p>take a look at list i came up below:<p>1. collaboration (campfire, huddle)<p>2. project management (basecamp, pivotal tracker, unfuddle)<p>3. time tracking (harvest, simpletimer<p>4. invoicing (freshbooks)<p>5. accounting (freshbooks, mint)<p>6. crm (highrise, salesforce)<p>7. todo list (too many)<p>8. customer support/ticketing management systems (uservoice, fogcreek)<p>9. knowledge based site (uservoice)<p>10. online backup service. (dropbox)<p>i am familiar with these because i am a freelance developer and i have clients. however there are already existing softwares. what do you suggest? i'm afraid if i enter a niche that i'm not familiar with ex. "invoicing for architects" i will have no idea and i'll probably have no passion for it.<p>edit:
okay maybe not "passion for it" but "familiarity to it" because saas are really not fun projects are they?	2012-04-18 13:47:46 UTC		10	12	[]

unfortunately, governor brown has signed into law the bill that we emailed you about earlier today. as a result of this, contracts with all california residents participating in the amazon associates program are terminated effective today, june 29, 2011. those california residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to amazon.com, endless.com, myhabit.com or smallparts.com. please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned before today will be processed and paid in full in accordance with the regular payment schedule.<p>you are receiving this email because our records indicate that you are a resident of california. if you are not currently a resident of california, or if you are relocating to another state in the near future, you can manage the details of your associates account here. and if you relocate to another state in the near future please contact us for reinstatement into the amazon associates program.<p>to avoid confusion, we would like to clarify that this development will only impact our ability to offer the associates program to california residents and will not affect your ability to purchase from amazon.com, endless.com, myhabit.com or smallparts.com.<p>we have enjoyed working with you and other california-based participants in the amazon associates program and, if this situation is rectified, would very much welcome the opportunity to re-open our associates program to california residents. as mentioned before, we are continuing to work on alternative ways to help california residents monetize their websites and we will be sure to contact you when these become available.<p>regards,<p>the amazon associates team	2011-06-30 04:46:58 UTC		13	3	[]

1804779	ask hn: what is the best way to find out if your startup idea is already taken?	whenever i come up with an idea for a startup or small project, i inevitably have to hit google, the crunchbase, hacker news, etc., to find out if it has already been done and if so how well. this process is pretty hit or miss for me, though, and already i've built something i thought i had scoped out the competition for only to get sideswiped by some better funded or better implemented effort.  what's the best way to do this research, and would it make sense for there to be a web service out there that aggregated all the startups, weekend projects, side projects, dead pooled websites, etc. to make it easier to do market research for our new ideas?  i almost think a service that provided this information reliably is itself a good startup idea, but i just want to know what the general consensus is on it.	2010-10-18 19:25:30 UTC		18	16	[]
6650576	ask hn: should i leave my job?	i don&#x27;t have a cs degree. i taught myself how to program in my early 20s (i&#x27;m now in my late 20s). i started out in front-end web development. i got hired by a company about 2.5 years ago to be on their front-end team. i learned a lot, in the early days it was great, they gave me the flexibility to do some really interesting things (back-end stuff, i even got to create a shared memory project using the win32 api for our services to share common caches). they keep giving me front-end projects though. now i&#x27;m working on an android app for them, it&#x27;s going fine, but i am seriously bored to tears and i&#x27;m finding it more and more difficult to stay motivated.<p>i don&#x27;t want to be a front-end engineer anymore. i&#x27;m building a compiler in my spare time and that&#x27;s what keeps me loving programming. obviously i should be working in the back-end or os level. how do i make this transition? i have some things i can point to in my work experience to make the transition, but not that much. should i go back to school (i don&#x27;t really want to)? how can i convince another employer to hire me on to do interesting systems work for them without an engineering degree (i studied literature). maybe i just need a perspective change?	2013-10-31 22:47:38 UTC		19	18	[]

1685471	i'm an introverted hacker. i want to join a frat.	[nicefirstpost]<p>let's start here: i'm a college freshman, and introverted and sheltered as hell. i've always been a shy, timid, geeky hacker.<p>introversion-wise, i can't handle extended amounts of time with people, or large crowds. both drain me like no other. i've always been shy and mellow. sheltered-wise, i never party or get drunk or any of that.<p>but now i'm in college and i want to change. i want to be social and party and so on.<p>[b]so i rushed a frat.[/b] and i got a bid. (probably cause i look good more than anything else.) and tonight i went to the first meeting.<p>and here's the problem. getting in was easy because it was just an alumni panel and an interview. [b] but i'm not sure how - or if - i can get through the pledge process.[/b] i'm just so far behind everyone else: i'm not good in crowds; don't know how to act at parties; don't know how to drink and drinking games; don't know how to dance; don't know.<p>[b] here's my first question: [/b] do you think i can improve and should try to complete the pledge process? (it's not a hardcore frat, so there's no hazing and such.) or should i work on my social skills for a semester and pledge again?<p>[b] next question: [/b] if you guys think i should go for it, how can i "catch up" socially? what do i need to learn and how? (talking? being in groups? drinking/games? partying?)<p>thanky.<p>[/nicefirstpost\	2010-09-13 04:09:27 UTC		39	88	[]

1265465	ask hn: patterns for deploying webapp updates with no downtime	i'm interested in techniques that can be used for deploying new versions of web applications with no perceived downtime for end users, without having to disable writes.<p>i think i know how to do this while disabling writes: run two copies of the database (one replicated from the other), disable writes at the application label, separate the slave and continue to serve reads from the master, upgrade the slave's schema, "activate" the slave (essentially telling it it's now a master), point a new instance of the application running the updated application code at it and switch the http traffic over - then set the original master up as a slave to the new master and enable writes again.<p>first question: is this sane / best practice?<p>second question: if i want to do this without disabling writes for the period of the upgrade, what are my options?<p>plenty of sites seem to manage to deploy new features without noticeable periods of downtime or read-only mode, so presumably there are a bunch of patterns for dealing with this. where can i learn about them?<p>to clarify: i'm talking about updates that include some kind of modification to the database schema.	2010-04-14 17:28:58 UTC		60	19	[]

8326028	ask hn: quit my job. company coming after me	i moved my family from denver to the bay area to work for a medical device startup. the pay was very good. after about 4 months, i decided to part ways with them for personal reasons.<p>the timing was unfortunate as i quit the day after i received a performance award. i did finish up a major project before i quit though.<p>the day i announced my intention to quit, my manager asked me to reconsider my decision. after i stuck to my decision, he had the vp of hr talk to me. this was when things became a little unsettling. hr manager advised that i pack my belongings and leave the building before either vp a or vp b found out about my decision to leave. i was also told that i would not find any positions in the medical device industry in the bay area. towards the end of our conversation, hr lady mentioned that her mental state was transitioning towards anger. due to these comments, i thought it best to leave the premises as soon as possible. i cleaned out my desk (on a friday), stayed for a few more hours, transitioned everything that i could think of to other co-workers, turned over my keys and left.<p>i later found out from another pretty reliable source that the company has decided to make life as difficult for me as possible. other employees have been questioned of their interactions with me after i quit.<p>1. i need to discuss the issue with a good attorney if possible. i am really new to this area and don&#x27;t have any contacts. references are appreciated.<p>2. i was asked to return a 100% of my sign-on bonus. i am willing to return it. however, about 30-40% of that was withheld for tax purposes. do i give them the entire amount and claim the taxed amount from irs?<p>3. i know that most of the issues here would probably be best discussed with an attorney. however, i would appreciate hn advise as well.	2014-09-16 18:15:49 UTC		67	43	[]

3933579	today just feels magical.	"today just feels magical. what a wonderful day."  said my fiancé as she walked out the door this afternoon to take our son to her mother's house.<p>i am a weekend warrior, a wantrapenuer, a dreamer.  i am constantly tinkering with a new idea, or an old one.  striving for the piece of mind that i have finished working the equivalent of a life time's worth of work. i'm 2-3 weeks away from my first beta launch.<p>when today began, i was discussing with my girl what we were going to do today.  because she was concerned with me meeting my side project goals for the weekend, she thought it best that she give me a full weekend of free time.  i told her that i think we should do something fun today, even if it is just for a few hours. so we did.<p>this morning i went to a coffee shop and banged out code for about 3 hours. i came back and, my son (almost 2) and i, listened to louie armstrong, ella fitzgerald, and frank sinatra while maggie got ready for our weekend outing.  it was amazing to watch him fall into a trance listening to louie sing la vie en rose.  now we have video of him running around the apartment dancing to louie, something that i will never forget.  we went to market street, shopped, had sushi, and my boy played in the water fountain with other kids from the neighborhood.<p>we came home, william took a nap while his mom and i made a couple jack n' cokes and watched an episode of shark tank, drinking and joking the entire time.<p>some of the most valuable things in life can not be bought.  don't miss out on them or let them slip away because you are distracted.  if i had taken up the offer to spend the totality of my weekend coding, these memories would never have happened.<p>if you are like me, striving for more than a paycheck and full belly, i hope you find some time this weekend to create memories that you will never forget, memories that can never be bought.<p>good luck and best wishes of success to you and your ventures.  for me, its time to refill my drink and get back to grinding out the future that my family deserves.	2012-05-05 23:10:17 UTC		80	8	[]

8823760	ask hn: should i report my main competitor for pci violations?	it has recently come to my attention that my largest competitor (b2b saas in a niche market) has blatantly disregarded all pci regulations for close to a decade.<p>he uses a multi-tenant database, stores cc numbers in plain-text (full 16 digits, cvv and expiration date), and shows that data to the user, in plain-text, at the time of payment.<p>i discovered this in the process of helping a new customer export their data from the old system.<p>i&#x27;ve spent days debating the ethics of reporting or making this public. on the one hand, i&#x27;d be putting him out of business (and i&#x27;m well poised to scoop up those new prospects). on the other hand, he&#x27;s putting people&#x27;s finances at risk and i feel obligated to say something that the public may not be able to discern.<p>any advice would be greatly appreciated.	2015-01-01 18:48:05 UTC		118	126	[]

3564178	how do you deal with growing pains?	hello hn,
for the past 2 years, i joined a startup that looked to get into the retail mobile scene.  over the past two years, i've worked extremely hard for this company and helped develop several technologies for them.  for my hard work, they award me a percentage of the company for every year i'm with them and cover some expenses.<p>lately, i feel very disconnected from the company.  the work isn't is as fun or exciting as it was before.  my last project, felt unstructured and a lot of miscommunication occurred and deadlines slipped.  there was a project review, and as a lead developer they informed me that i'm not living up to their expectations.  i think this assessment was fair and they agreed that in order to help me grow, we should structure to my week and have weekly reviews regarding my objectives.<p>i want to ask hn, how do you deal with such growing pains?  sometimes i feel the founders say one thing but then do another. instead of helping me grow, i feel they're just to busy, and i look to my colleagues for help.  i've felt depressed with my work and the crazy hours.  sometimes, there's so much on my plate, i don't know how to deal with it in a prioritized manner, when everything is a priority.  i've felt as if doors have been closed to me that were once open.  i don't know if i've outgrown this company and it's time to move on.<p>thanks for listening.	2012-02-07 23:24:12 UTC		1	0	[]

3423789	jvm host - how to use custom truetype fonts with java, jsp or servlets?	our java hosting clients happen to require custom font for their dynamically generated images or reports. basically, there are 2 methods of making new ttf fonts available to your servlets or jsp - installing in jdk directory tree or outside of it. the methods and their variants will be described below in more details with examples. installation outside of jdk tree. this is preferred method as you can embed the font files inside your application (.war or .jar) and do not depend on what fonts are provided by the jvm your application is running in or underlying os. you can also place fonts in a subdirectory of your home directory. the fonts can be loaded on the fly. optionally - when you request the install on our side - we can choose to install the font system-wide so that any jdk can see it. example of a font already installed this way on our shared java hosting servers is bitstream vera that can be used (in a slanted variant in this example) simply by calling its name...	2012-01-04 12:12:17 UTC	http://www.jvmhost.com/articles/using_custom_truetype_fonts_with_java_jsp_servlets#.TwRCBuIC2Ko.hackernews	1	0	[]

443765	lead generation - customer nurturing using company website	hi,
engago technologies ltd. presents leadsexplorer.
www.leadsexplorer.com www.engago.com<p>best regards,
tom
engago technologies ltd.<p>company websites are failing to generate b2b leads
about 2 years ago we from engago technologies had the plan to develop an online web service for businesses. during the writing of the business plan we were faced with the problem of lead generation as this would rely heavily upon the website.
industry research reports that only 2 to 3% of all website visitors will ever register on an online form for a download, a podcast or contact a company directly for further information.  thus about 97% of all potential customers are lost upfront.<p>on the other hand most (7 out of 10) business deals start with an internet search for retrieving information and comparing products and solutions.
this means most potential customers will be looking around your website, but hardly any of them will contact you or will reveal their identity. this leaves you without any selling opportunity although the leads have visited your website.<p>during several discussions with friends and colleagues active in different business, they recognized having the same problem. this led to the conclusion of being a general problem for both brick-and-mortar enterprises and online businesses.
any company that has visitors on their website hardly generates any leads from their website as there is no identification of those visitors and the companies they represent.<p>after a market research on several existing solutions we saw room for improvement in features, functions and a higher level of company identification. thus we decided to tackle the problem of lead generation and customer nurturing by developing a solution that starts by identifying the website visitors by company name and provides additional information like language, geographic location, number of visits and visitors by company, the search terms used or direct access. the thumbnails of the pages visited indicate visually the interest in your specific products or solutions.<p>using the friends and colleagues as beta users, allowed us to adjust and improve the solution to their needs by adding functions and features like a weekly or daily email report of the visiting companies.<p>lead generation
the first purpose of the service is to contact (by cold calling or sending email) possible contacts within the visiting organization. these contacts are found using the internet data mining on the company supplied by leadsexplorer.<p>in order to keep track of you communications we have added a crm that is seamless integrated with the website and email communication exchanges. thus any visitor from any company in the crm is plotted on the activity chart of the company. the activity charts bring together the communications history and the visit history. this allows you to see and analyze the interactions and the reactions upon your communications allowing adjusting the message.
the activity charts also indicate the prospects that need more or less attention compared to their lead qualification valuation.<p>as email has become probably the most important communications channel in business, we have added the automatic collection and aggregation of the emails you have sent to and received from a company. thus all of your emails are neatly organized for every customer in the crm.<p>customer retention
generating leads and turning them into new customers is very exciting, but keeping your customers will normally bring more operating income, hence the importance of improving the efficiency of your customer retention.<p>1) as you can precisely follow–up on your communications and the reactions of your customers by the visits and their communications, it is likely you can improve your customer retention as you can measure the level of interest of your customers. 
you will be able to analyze: 
- if a message generated interest or not.
- if there is any sign of interest
- if there is an increase or decrease of interest
- how the customer reacts upon different messages and information.<p>2) if the company starts visiting again or even worse stops visiting, it is time for your account manager to call upon his contacts within the company. he is then armed with the information about the interests shown in your products or your solutions by the pages visited or re-visited.<p>leadsexplorer http://www.leadsexplorer.com
the leadsexplorer web service is applicable to large and small companies having a website that receives traffic, no matter how much traffic.<p>our view is that all online information:
- the website
- the email communications
- the crm
has to come together in one environment in order to increase your sales and your bottom line.<p>leadsexplorer is available in 2 packages:
- the basic version for discovery of the visiting companies allowing capturing information from the internet and export the data to a csv file (comma separated values) for further use in a spreadsheet, data base or a crm.
pricing is based upon number of monthly visitors and number of users.<p>- the combined solution with discovery of the visiting companies and a crm provides the seamless integration between your company website and your email conversations with your leads and customers.
pricing is based upon the number of monthly leads and number of users.<p>engago technologies ltd. http://www.engago.com

4997021	mobile first, right thumb navigation	to be more thumb-friendly, why shouldn't we consider placing navigation on the right? roughly 90 percent of the world is right-handed, so wouldn't this make more sense? the most easily swipeable area for righties resembles a rainbow starting from the bottom left arcing toward the top right of the screen. below that rainbow is a thumb/palm blind spot, above that rainbow requires a user to shuffle the phone in the palm and a thumb extension to reach. the taller the screen, the larger that area above the rainbow becomes and hence more difficult to navigate. even the smaller-screened phones such as the first-generation iphone, have this less-reachable area.	2013-01-02 15:09:53 UTC	http://fsm.bdconf.com/blog/mobile-first-right-thumb-navigation	1	0	[]

5766795	ask hn: how to unlock an out-of-contract verizon iphone 4s?	it seems that apple made it impossible for after sales verizon iphone 4s to be unlocked, while there are several sites that says they unlock verizon imei (including mine), the reality is that all verizon imei unlocking services is currently unavailable due to apple closing all the third-party verizon reseller accounts that allows verizon phones to be unlocked in apple's database, so currently everyone who paid the service is on the long waiting-list until such time that apple enable the account for unlocking. so i have a handful of angry customers which have demanded a refund, which i did refunded.<p>afaik, there is no currently working verizon imei unlocking service for iphone 4s out there, iphone 5 is not on the list because as you may know verizon iphone 5 is unlocked by default.	2013-05-25 09:34:46 UTC		1	0	[]

585551	innovations inspired by star trek	in the early years of the last century, a new generation of scientists was inspired by the mysteries of the world around them. einstein, bohr and others spent the rest of their lives engaged in a debate about the nature of the atom.<p>in the latter part of the 20th century, budding scientists had it far easier. they had star trek for inspiration. from warp fields to flat-screen tvs, star trek boldly took its viewers where no programme had taken us before. among those fans, of course, were the inventors, scientists and all-round boffins of today.<p>as the new star trek film prepares to land at a cinema near you, it’s time to take stock of some of those “far-fetched” ideas that we now take for granted.<p>now, could someone get to work on synthehol, please?<p>nec mobile<p>1  the flip-top mobile phone
for a generation that grew up flicking imaginary communicators and saying “beam me up, scotty”, the now near-ubiquitous flip-top mobile phone was the answer to our prayers.<p>2 the sound of automatic doors
the first electrically operated sliding automatic doors were fitted in texas in 1960. they ran on noisy rubber wheels. fifty years later, all of the world’s sliding doors open with a swooooosh. where do you suppose that idea came from?<p>3. flat-screen tvs, touch-screen computers, video-conferencing          
we laughed when we saw them. television sets could never be that small, computers could never be that responsive. in 2009, we’re all fighting over the latest half-inch thick sony and samsung lcds, then wondering how we plug our iphones into them. business types, meanwhile, are conducting transglobal negotiations in much the same manner as kirk did with the klingons.<p>enterprise shuttle
4. the first space shuttle
nasa called its first space shuttle (above) the enterprise, following a letter-writing campaign by fans in 1976. the ship was used in test flights but was never truly spaceworthy.<p>5. the transporter beam
although the original owes its existence to the show’s minuscule budget, that hasn’t stopped real scientists from trying to make one. in 2007, a new record was set for quantum teleportation, when data was beamed 89 miles from the island of la palma to tenerife.<p>6. the tricorder
dr mccoy’s original all-in-one medical diagnostic tool was designed by one of the unsung heroes of star trek, wah ming chang, who also came up with the look for the communicator. although no such thing yet exists, we take heart from the fact that every single pda on the planet looks like a tricorder, and from this news article, which claims that pdas can now be made to work as full-on medical scanners.<p>jet injector<p>7. the hypospray
you try and tell me that there’s no star trek influence in the final design of jet injectors, the special hypodermics used for mass immunisation programmes. go on, try.<p>8. warp drive
on the face of it, this is one of star trek’s most unlikely technologies. however, it does have roots in quantum physics, in which components of an atom do hop from place to place without, seemingly, touching a point in between (see the excellent book quantum by manjit kumar for details). yes, i know. it puzzled einstein, too. and it seems to have defeated nasa, whose six-year breakthrough propulsion physics program was cancelled in 2002. unless, of course, they succeeded. and fell through into a parallel universe.<p>blu-ray laser phaser! - free videos are just a click away<p>9. the phaser
yep, it’s the us military again, and they've got a big laser gun.<p>if you have more classic tastes, then you can take apart your playstation 3 and turn a plastic toy phaser into the real thing. just like the man in the video above.<p>cloaking<p>10. the cloaking device
according to a 2007 report at networkworld.com, purdue university engineers have created something that looks like a spiky hairbrush that has the ability to “bend” light around any object being cloaked. we are told to expect an invisible tank by 2012. above is how we imagine it will look in the dark.<p>for more on the new star trek film, head to the blockbuster buzz, or read the full times review.	2009-04-29 18:09:00 UTC	http://timesonline.typepad.com/technology/2009/04/ten-innovations-inspired-by-star-trek.html	1	1	[]
7049844	ask hn: ok, so what do i do now?	i’m in a bit of a predicament, so i’m seeking advice from the more business minded side of hn.<p>i do a lot of “experiential retailing” type of work for some big brands in nyc.  basically, informational type ipad apps that get embedded in store displays.  because the apps are similar to each other, i decided to create an authoring environment to build them.  i looked at adobe dps and magplus and designed&#x2f;built the authoring environment to work similarly.  you design the “app” in an adobe photoshop, press the publish button and voila you have an app.  no need for doing anything in xcode, etc.<p>so once i finished writing this authoring app, a light bulb popped inside my head and i thought, “why not use this for tablet magazines?”<p>i’ve been going back and forth between nyc and vietnam for the last two years.  so after i finished the authoring environment, i thought i’d publish a magazine using my tool as a means to eat my own dog food. sitting around a table with some local friends we iterated over a lot of ideas that we could produce cheaply&#x2f;easily.  we thought of a lot of ideas, but since most of my local friends work in the fashion industry, we settled on a fashion magazine.  it would mostly be media, little to no text, etc.<p>so, we’ve produced the first edition of our magazine and are about to publish it.  what started as an experiment, is now a very real thing here in vietnam.  our facebook page for the magazine hit 100k likes with an advertising spend of only a few hundred dollars.  this reaction has caught everyone by surprise.  we’re more popular on facebook than the four leading vietnam fashion magazines combined.<p>here is my predicament: i don’t know what to do with this tool.  i thought bootstrap it, but i think it’ll take a lot of cash to position it against adobe dps and magplus.  if i seek funding, i’d probably have to return the us permanently and abandon this magazine, which might be a hard thing to do if it proves popular.<p>any advice?	2014-01-13 10:38:50 UTC		1	1	[]

5874679	show hn: please critique my vocabulary building tool for japanese	i built a japanese vocabulary building tool that pulls words and phrases from popular media, like songs and tv shows. i would love some feedback on whether or not the concept resonates. you can check it out at http:&#x2f;&#x2f;lexicandy.com&#x2f; and follow us at @lexicandyapp.<p>i believe the problem with most pre made lists isn&#x27;t that you didn&#x27;t make them. it&#x27;s that the words are often completely disconnected from content you use regularly. a pre made deck of thousands of words sounds great at first, but then you realize using it is about as fun as memorizing a dictionary… because that&#x27;s essentially what you&#x27;re doing.<p>the idea is to break vocabulary building into small chunks, with the goal being to fully understand the material the words are being drawn from. so while you may not be fluent after learning all the words from, say, the first episode of honey and clover, you will be able to watch an <i>entire</i> episode in japanese.<p>you&#x27;ll get a free starter deck for signing up, so no one has to spend any money to check things out. but additional decks must be purchased at 3 cents a word. here&#x27;s why:<p>1. i want to be able to provide a wide variety of <i>accurate</i> content. that means hiring native japanese speakers to pull the words from the songs, videos, etc.<p>2. i want to be able to provide explanations for slang, cultural references, colloquialisms… all the things that make a language come alive. again, that means hiring native speakers to annotate.<p>3. i want to build more than the basic flashcard program that&#x27;s there now. most online language apps use gamification elements, but as an avid gamer i&#x27;m into actual games. i&#x27;ll need money to build both competitive and single player experiences.<p>thoughts? comments? suggestions?	2013-06-13 15:50:23 UTC		1	1	[]

2939023	how to unsell what you have sold during validation in customer development	some background:
a lot of startups follow some kind of customer development model or similar, where the idea is to iteratively
1. modify the product
2. try to sell it (validate it) 
until the business model seems to work. often it does not make sense to build a full version of the product during each iteration and sometimes even a power point presentation is enough, showing what could be built.&#60;p&#62;when you try to validate, you probably want more than one customer to buy. but what should you do if too few buy during each pivot/iteration. if you have signed the contracts with those who bought during previous pivots, you still need to deliver. having a lot of custom solutions to build at the same time as the real product will easily take up all resources.&#60;p&#62;what do others do? is it possible to somehow unsell what you have sold, or try to convince the old customers to take the real version instead, or is this just a risk that every entrepreneur has to live with?&#60;p&#62;thanks for your help.	2011-08-29 21:12:44 UTC		2	0	[]

1402026	ask hn: please critique my fb game	http://apps.facebook.com/whocutthedeck<p>first, sorry it's fb.  it was a convenient choice, but i'm not monetizing it at all.  second, i'm not collecting data.  if you crash out you might leave behind your fb id, first name and profile image url.  but that gets deleted if you leave normally.<p>in any event, i made this to play table top games (cards for now) with a friend leaving town.  i'm trying to mimic the experience of being there.  but since i'm a human, i want it to be cool, which means used.<p>but i think in it's current state it's not compelling.  does it need a tutorial? does it need avatars?  is it too hard to figure out?<p>in any event, if you just use it to play a game and it works out, i'd love to know about that, too :)<p>thanks	2010-06-03 18:15:41 UTC		2	0	[]

3826359	why we acquired fxcamera, the biggest android photo app	today we at bitcellar are excited to announce our acquisition of fxcamera, one of the most popular android camera apps in the world.  fxcamera is currently used in over 201 countries allowing people across the world to take pictures in a fun and exciting way. fxcamera turns your everyday moments into exciting, vivid snapshots.<p>http://www.thebitcellar.com/press/20120411.html<p>bitcellar's mission is to become a premier destination for your photos, by offering permanence (reliable storage) and ease of discovery (innovative search features).<p>japan is in the midst of cherry blossom season.  cherry blossoms have a special place in japanese culture for its fleeting beauty.  this year we see even more people photographing cherry blossoms with smartphones than ever before in favor of their digital cameras.  smartphones are rapidly catching up to high-end digital cameras in both features and quality.  more importantly, we are rarely without our smartphones and can take pictures at any time.  smartphones also allow us to easily apply a variety of effects for greater artistic expression adding a new element of fun without worrying about film capacity.<p>we want to take this one step further by eliminating the distance between people and their pictures.  we want to create a seamless experience that bridges the gap between taking photos and enjoying our rapidly growing personal collection of photos with storage and search.<p>fxcamera is one of the biggest global successes to come out of the mobile photo space.  users from japan only account for roughly 25% of the base while over half of the users are english speakers.  currently the app boasts over 15 million downloads and counting.  japanese brands are renown in the traditional camera market and we hope to carry on this tradition in the digital realm by making fxcamera more attractive to users.<p>through this acquisition, morifumi yamashita will be joining the executive team and continue to lead the development of fxcamera.  for more information regarding our upcoming service, bitcellar please stay tuned or sign up to be notified through our mailing list on our homepage.<p>--

2620573	ask hn: how to balance equity when the investor is also a client? 	dear all,<p>i've seen several examples of startups where investors exchange funds for equity, but what about when the investor is also a client for the new business?  you could just keep things separated, i know, but any other ideas to streamline the relationship?<p>would it be reasonable exchanging funds for services (instead of equity) in a saas scenario where the new service will reduce investor/client's existing operational cost?<p>many thanks for any insight.	2011-06-04 21:54:55 UTC		3	1	[]

8567623	ask hn: how lacking speaking and writing could i get a programming job?	 i have a ph.d. in math and four years in cs (i drop out of cs because i began to study my ph.d, luckly i was able to put together my studies in math and cs and publish some papers about complexity of algorithms in top rank publications (i got tenure in a good university). i can program in many languages, python, ruby, lisp, scala, javascript, mathematica, julia, r  and others.  but my main weakness is lack of experience  developing any big project. i don&#x27;t have a github account, it seems i am always learning and i, perhaps wrongly, believe that learning increase my opportunities more than developing, i have very little to show up for any prospective employer. also,  as i read english only sporadically and write a little bit, my speaking and writings skills are very weak.<p>what would you advice me to do to get better prospects to get a programmer job?  i would prefer to do it remotely but that seems much more difficult.<p>on top of that, i am not so young, more than 30.  perhaps you could suggest another kind of job related to programming?<p>as i have never worked with a team, i imagine there are many unknown unknown, so i don&#x27;t have any clue about how i would fit in any team.  one day i was reading about advice to be a good data analyst, and p. norvig words are etched in my memory: you need to have a lot of experience in big data analysis, it doesn&#x27;t matter what or where you studied, you need to have a lot of hand experience with big data.<p>perhaps is too late for me, to pursue this path and i may find a career outside of programming, but i enjoy learning and coding and i will try get a job in this field.<p>added at 17:51, madrid local time.<p>thinking about all the difficulties, it may be an alternative to think about creating a start-up, but now the problem is what kind of product or service can i&#x2f;my team&#x2f;, provide that is of real value? but perhaps this problem is bigger than the first one, is a bootstrap.	2014-11-06 16:07:16 UTC		3	4	[]

1737797	what’s the most commonly used framework for web development and why?	i've recently come across a problem that might be a problem for now, but can be a problem later, and that is choosing the right web development framework for a website project. i'm sure this happened to many of others out there, too.&#60;p&#62;i want to incorporate the framework so that the development is more efficient, easy to maintain, easy to scale, have full control in what you want to do and not too limited by the constraints of the framworkable, separation between front-end interface, business logic and data retrieval (i guess more dyanmic).&#60;p&#62;so first of all, i would like ask what is the most commonly used framework out there? and what is the advantage of using it over others?&#60;p&#62;and what about asp.net mvc, ruby on rails and yii? and any input on these three framework? thanks.	2010-09-28 23:55:51 UTC		4	6	[]

9072275	ask hn: newbie freelancer. what do i do with this opportunity?	i just had a potential opportunity fall into my lap and i&#x27;m not really sure what i should do to best capitalize on it.  i had a feature request opened for a project of mine on github where the requester indicated that he would be willing to set up a contractual arrangement to get the work done.  i&#x27;ve never done any contract work before, although i&#x27;ve been curious about it.<p>most of the advice i have read regarding freelancing seems focused on rather bigger gigs than this one.  my estimate is that it will take no more than a weekend hack session to get the requested feature out the door.  the entire repo is only in the 1kloc range.  on the other hand, i am certainly a domain expert for this particular niche.  since the client here is a developer himself, it seems clear to me that he is primarily interested in my domain knowledge.<p>given all of this, i have lots of questions; i feel a bit lost really.<p>* what would be a reasonable ballpark for this sort of work?<p>* what sort of contract would i need to set up?<p>* how do individual freelancers usually process payments?  paypal, or perhaps something better?<p>* the client is located in the uk, and i am located in the us.  how does that complicate things?  (taxes, etc.)<p>* is the effort worth it for a project of this size?<p>* are there good resources to learn these things and more about freelancing?  searching has yielded lots of blog posts full of contradictory opinions.<p>* how do i not make a fool of myself?  :)	2015-02-19 03:28:10 UTC		6	2	[]

2303496	ask hn: where could i find a co-founder that wants to change the world?	hey hn,
i am sick of the "quick buck" people, and people who want quick apps that dont change anything in our lifes.
i am a front end developer/ui/ux designer with a very solid startup and a solid direction. we are bootstrapped and are already profitable. in order for me to move to the next level i need a very smart technical co-founder to help me solve some serious issues. this is not another game app, location game or group messaging, its actually something that if executed right has unlimited potential.
please message me if you want to know more, i am just very tired of meeting people who are not really passionate about changing the world and just want a quick buck because of this mini bubble.
hope this message in a bottle finds someone.	2011-03-09 02:12:54 UTC		6	9	[]

1265562	ask hn: apps using sproutcore?	hey guys, trying to find a list of apps using sproutcore.  i put together a list using cappuccino here: http://www.cloudomatic.com/tag/cappuccino/ , saw that someone then search for sproutcore afterwards, which made me think of tagging apps with sproutcore would be useful.<p>ps- looking for real web apps that people can sign up for/use, not strictly tech demos.	2010-04-14 17:55:01 UTC		7	5	[]
4564241	ask hn: what services do people pay for online?	i'm curious to get some concrete numbers about what people are really spending on (as well as an idea of some services _you_ actually pay for online).<p>is there anything you pay for that is experimental/simple (something that a team could have made in a few days/weeks?), or are most things massive infrastructure plays (like pro accounts and extra storage for big-name companies)?<p>we're doing everything we can to stay away from ads (they're both annoying and distracting), but not sure what our best alternatives are.<p>thanks!	2012-09-24 12:22:40 UTC		7	13	[]
5874682	ask hn: is chrome now the standard for web developers?	i&#x27;ve been using firefox in combination with firebug for years and it seemed that most web developers are quite fond of that combination. but in the recent year or so the development of firebug not only has slowed down, but seems to be target of mockery.<p>i&#x27;ve been listening to a ton of podcasts this year and everytime the topics browser or development tools comes up people are talking about chrome. sometimes mentioning firefox with a certain tone that implies &quot;if you&#x27;re still using that old...&quot;.<p>i&#x27;m surprised. i like firefox as my main browser. but there is probably a connection between the development speed of firebug and the popularity of chrome&#x27;s developer tools. having two browsers running using only one of them to develop feels rather odd, but i feel like i&#x27;m missing out otherwise.<p>what happened that made firefox vanish out of the vocabulary of most developers?	2013-06-13 15:51:01 UTC		7	13	[]
5048132	why you shouldn't do what aaron did	hi,<p>tl;dr if swartz's death is triggering suicidal thoughts, you must understand that this will pass, and life will be worth living.<p>after seeing the impact of aaron swartz's death on the hacker news community, i am concerned about the werther effect (the tendency of a prominent suicide to trigger other suicides).  i hope i can help by sharing what i learnt through 10+ years of depression and recovery.<p>depression robs you of the ability to:
1. remember happiness
2. feel happiness
3. anticipate happiness
4. make considered decisions<p>#1-#3 make you miserable, but #4 is the killer.  bits of your brain actually shut down, and you run on pure emotion.  for example, when i was depressed, i was easy prey for offers like "4 for the price of 3 on this crappy overpriced chocolate" because i couldn't weigh it up.  all i could think was "chocolate: good.  4 for 3: good.  4 for 3 chocolate: irresistible".  but if you're running on pure emotion and your emotions tell you "everything sucks" well ... suicide looks like a good option.<p>so why didn't i kill myself?  somewhere in my guts, there was a stubborn belief that "this will pass".  you might even call it a sense of entitlement: "come on world -- you can give me something better than this!"  and you know what?  it did!  thanks to some wonderful people, and to cognitive behavioral therapy, i found a way to recover.<p>with the best 10+ years of my life lost to depression, starting from scratch in my 30s has been hard, but it's still a life, and i swear that life is worth more than you can possibly understand when you're depressed.<p>stay strong,<p>pitarou	2013-01-12 16:39:50 UTC		519	158	[]

5361805	looking for a designer co-founder	hi, my name is jared. i am 21 and just finishing up my junior year as a cs major. for the past 1.5 years i have been working on a side project called idealist, a collaboration tool. my time has been spent doing market research, building, and pivoting. i have learned some cool things along the way. i am confident that i have found a market to compete in full of paying customers. idealist is definitely not the first product to the online collaboration space. however, many people are still using e-mail to collaborate because they are unaware of better solutions. i would like to take idealist to the next step with the help of a co-founder.<p>so, idealist is a real-time collaboration platform. initially, i started out building a list-making tool. after some market research and talking with potential customers i learned that distance collaboration is a very common problem. in fact, many people are willing to pay a lot of money to improve their ability to communicate online. (see pg's frighteningly ambitious startup ideas)<p>so far i have built a web app that is somewhere in between launching and the prototype phase. you can actually sign up for it and take it for a spin at goidealist.com. currently the focus is on making lists, which i hope to downplay in future iterations. i have also developed an iphone and ipad app. the ios apps are unpublished for now because i am still tweaking the core of the service.<p>i am looking for a design-savvy co-founder who wants to try a startup. if distance collaboration is an interesting problem to you then drop me a line at cofounder at goidealist.com.	2013-03-12 13:59:31 UTC		10	12	[]

4070716	ask hn: twitter bootstrap for "everyone else"?	i'm thinking of using twitter bootstrap for a site of mine, but i began to have some doubts while looking at it: it's a fairly small font, and has small icons, and come to think of it, twitter itself is generally oriented towards the young and more technically savvy (the kind of people who know that it's really easy to increase the browser's font size).  sure, there are probably counter examples of someone's grandma being an avid twitter user, but i got to wondering if twitter bootstrap is a very good choice for a site very much aimed at "normal, non-technical people", who may also be a bit older than average, and not have the eyesight or patience to deal with something so small.<p>has anyone actually done any research into this that they'd like to share?  i know that it's in theory possible to resize it, but i'm a bit wary of how that would work out in practice.	2012-06-05 20:38:23 UTC		9	6	[]

430289	ask hc: suggestions on customers for this algorithm?	a few weeks ago, i posted "how to package this algorithm" at http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=389526<p>by then, i was thinking of building our own customer oriented software/web site.  after some in-depth discussions, we decided to focus on what we're good at, ie algorithm design and tweaks, and partner up with others to sell it.  so we built it into a paid web service called purifyr:  http://www.purifyr.com/<p>please give it a try and let me know what do you think of it.<p>here are some usage scenarios:<p>- semantic analysis processing: the value of semantic analysis is the ability to 'understand' a web page. purifyr could help to remove 'noise' contents to make the analysis work much faster and easier.<p>- printer friendly web: never waste paper and inks! by using purifyr to clean up the web pages first, you could print only what your users want. even better, you could apply customized stylesheets to keep all print-outs in a consistent look-and-feel.<p>- mobile ready content: mostly of today's web pages are for desktop monitors, not mobile devices. using purifyr to extract the content, you'd make any urls readable on mobile devices.<p>thanks,

immediate, high-density, high-accuracy information on their soil nutrient needs.  farmers can use this information to manage crop inputs, such as fertilizer, more efficiently, increasing yield while reducing costs and environmental impact.  these tools provide solum with a rich dataset of agricultural information that can be used to further optimize operations, and provide a data-driven, quantitative framework for best management practices.<p>our first products are shipping next month, and we're looking to bring on software engineers to develop backend applications to manage data generated by these systems, as well as a web-based frontend to allow customers to analyze and visualize their data.  this will form the basis of our long-term goal, developing analysis software to integrate our measurement data with additional inputs--such as weather, satellite imagery, crop yield, seed density, etc--to fully optimize agriculture operations.  we're a small team of physicists, mechanical engineers, and chemists working out of mountain view.  we're looking for full-time developers able to work independently and help us define everything from the ground up.  if you're excited to work with a cross-disciplinary team on a very big problem with a big global impact, email us at jobs@solumtech.com.  you can also contact me directly at white@solumtech.com.<p>justin white
co-founder, cto solum, inc<p>our development stack:<p><pre><code>  linux, c, python, and wx on our field-deployed measurement hardware

872816	hn feedback: shortcuts bookmarklets	hn: i wrote some bookmarklets called shortcuts that quickly show you all of the keyboard shortcuts for your browser without interrupting your workflow. if you'd like to, check them out! you can get them (and more information, including screenshots) from http://scottjackson.org/software/shortcuts<p>i'd love to get some feedback from the hn community -- there are definitely some websites that the bookmarklets don't work for (wikipedia is a big one, and i'd love to know why), so if you guys could let me know if the bookmarklets don't work for a site, that would be great.<p>plans for the future: make bookmarklets for other browsers (safari and firefox for mac os x only at the moment -- i'll do more if there's demand for it) and make the shortcuts window look less craptactular (i have no design talent. i think i'm going to need to find someone to help me css the shit out of this).<p>again, that's http://scottjackson.org/software/shortcuts	2009-10-10 02:07:24 UTC		2	0	[]

3210616	ask hn: good resources for beginning with f#?	looking for any good beginning tutorials for breaking into functional programming using f#<p>i'm choosing f# solely based on the fact that .net has been my bread and butter for a while now, and i figure my familiarity with the ide and platform as a whole would make it a good choice to begin learning functional programming. also, i can just get-going with it quickly, as i have .net and vs on just about every machine i own.<p>once i've got the basics down and can begin to "think" in more functional terms, i plan on migrating to another functional language (suggestions welcome).<p>although i understand some basic functional approaches (passing around functions as arguments, functions that return functions, lambda expressions), please go ahead and assume i need a "my first functional program" style set of advice.<p>bonus points if the tutorials can actually demonstrate real world applications of what they're teaching, but that might be a bit much to expect from a "beginning" set of tutorials.<p>thanks in advance!	2011-11-08 13:27:50 UTC		3	0	[]

2958779	an inventor's biological clock	the average inventor is more likely to be:<p>a) older - there is a higher incidence of inventors aged in their 40s to 50s who file patents; and
b) self determining - an inventor is less likely to be associated with a large firm or a university.<p>inventors do not have disproportionally more genius genes, but are highly motivated and therefore are driven to make a difference. studies of identical twins separated at birth indicates that creative thinking is:<p>a) less genetically based (estimated to be a one third contribution);
b) more learning based (estimated to be a two-thirds contribution) leading to creating confidence in the capacity to create.
what does the above profile represent? why are inventors generally older? is there a biological clock for inventing?<p>there are many exceptions to the above profile; however, perhaps we should consider maslowâs pyramid of hierarchy of needs.  this pyramid has basic needs at its base, such as food and shelter, and self-actualisation at the peak.<p>self-actualisation was coined by abraham maslow, a professor of psychology, who believed that focus should be on the positive qualities in people. maslowâs postulate was that, to be a fully formed self, an individual has to move from the potential of "what you can be" to realise what "you must be".  that is, you must fulfil your full potential. perhaps patent filing as a form of self-actualisation, since it occurs at a later stage of one's working life?<p>inventors need networks
to achieve self-actualisation as inventors, people need networks to form the basis of learning.<p>you and your hypothetical identical twin have the same ability, invention and background. however, the outcome is different if:<p>a) you stay in the shed tinkering, whilst
b) your identical twin communicates with many people from diverse backgrounds.
in the above scenario, your identical twin will have a better output. the difference within these results are realised within a week. thus, communication is critical to develop inventions.<p>what role can a patent have?
a patent helps an individual publish an identity as an inventor which provides the means to engage with a like community. the inventor then may learn from members of a like-focused community. this provides a basis for reflection for the inventor and growth for the inventive concept.<p>patents would therefore have a much greater contribution to both the individual and the community if patents were linked with communication systems.  should patent databases have communication links embedded? do patent databases have the potential to be the next facebook?<p>self-actualisation takes place in less than 1% of the adult population.  likewise, inventors are also a rare species.  could this be because the tools to aid invention remain hidden from a large part of the population?<p>patents, when taking the form of a communication means for invention, must become less impenetrable and more accessible. patents often remain hidden from like minded inventors because they speak in a language that is more typical of patent attorneys than inventors.<p>peer-to-patent - the new communication means?
the peer-to-patent systems implemented over the last two years were one step forward; however, their benefits are not yet realised.  further, the us implementation of the peer to patent project was concluded after two years due to the economic downturn. perhaps this can now give rise to a wiki-patent site to focus more strongly on communication of patent technology, rather than uncovering prior art for the benefit of the patent examination process. if you think this idea has teeth â maybe we could start one?<p>inventors are nurtured and the tools for nurturing should be developed to capture invention. maybe patent offices around the world could incorporate inventor communication tools and open their protocols to allow a web 2.0 site to flourish.	2011-09-04 04:02:05 UTC	http://blog.1place.com.au/2011/09/03/an-inventor%E2%80%99s-biological-clock/#more-1656	1	0	[]

3143780	do deals site work for software?	without mentioning my software here is the story of my experience with a recent promotion at a daily deals website for software.<p>i recently launched my software and have been making on average 1 sale per day. the price is around $100.<p>i have not done any heavy marketing yet and still improving the software so i am thinking what if i can sell my software at a lower price point, will it attract more users?<p>so i went to this deals website and found through previous testimonials that the best way to gain more if you could price it around $20<p>so cutting the long story, i decided to do the deal promo at 80% discount and the deals website takes 50% of the revenue. so for every sale i make $10.<p>since the deal was only for a day i thought of experimenting.<p>the deal went live @12 in the midnight. by the morning i woke up, i had 10 orders in my inbox.<p>since then every hour sent around 2-3 orders.
by the end of the deal time, i ended up with a total of around 30 orders.<p>now let us crunch the numbers.<p>my total profit on 30 orders = $300<p>my total profit on average on a regular day = $100<p>that seems a good decision right?<p>let us talk about the support time.<p>it took around 6 hours of my total day time (if you add up all the time) to monitor the deals page for customers asking questions and sending registration codes. yes there were lots and lots of questions from users and i was readily answering them.<p>so if i value my time at all and put it at $50/hr then the cost is around $300 worth of support time.<p>being self employed and working solely on the software gives me the liberty to tweak my hourly rate to zero and make me feel good about the deal or raise it higher and make me feel bad about it.<p>but the deal thing provided lot of insight.
- at low price point the software sells like fire
- users really want the software
- hopefully they will talk to their colleagues and buy more licenses 
- generate more traction<p>next time, may be i will do the deal at a little higher price point and see how it goes.	2011-10-22 16:28:02 UTC		1	1	[]

3337989	what do you think of this idea for a viral facebook app?	just read a techcrunch article titled:  "sean parker: "this election, social media will determine the outcome"
http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/09/sean-parker-social-media-election/<p>it got me thinking...  i'd like to see a facebook app that let's you choose and share which political candidates you would vote for along with your main reason for doing so. (this can be both on the local and national level)<p>only your friends would be allowed to see your choices (and only if they provide their choices as well).<p>there's a certain viral element to this. after you fill it out, it can post on your wall with something like:<p>-----------
who i'm voting for
"see which candidates john doe is voting for and why"
-----------<p>i feel like this is an app i would be excited to download and share.<p>what do you guys think?  anyone know of a similar app that already does this?	2011-12-10 17:43:03 UTC		1	1	[]

6861501	why opengl probably isn't the graphics api of the future and i hope it dies	i decided to write this blog post after seeing david rosen&#x27;s 2010 blog article on opengl vs directx linked here yesterday. it&#x27;s also been an ongoing conversation between myself and a few other programmers on twitter. to summarize: with amd&#x27;s recent announcement of mantle things are getting really interesting in the graphics api wars. this blog details why i think mantle <i>could</i> (hopefully) unseat opengl as the cross platform api of choice and why directx is better positioned to continue evolving than opengl is.	2013-12-06 15:27:02 UTC	http://inovaekeith.blogspot.com/2013/12/why-opengl-probably-isnt-graphics-api.html	1	0	[]

1390378	ask hn: looking for an interesting project(s) to eat up some spare time	i'm looking for interesting ideas/problems that i could spend my spare time programming solutions for. having been severely burnt out from a couple of start-up ventures that ate up 5 years of my time, i'm really just looking for something i can enjoy coding in the background of my life at a leisurely pace.<p>the ideal project would see me spending more time programming on the back-end rather than wasting a day fiddling with css, and having to spend lots time considering complex issues rather than doing lots of 'grunt work' coding, and ideally have no time pressures, as it's something i'd do for enjoyment, rather than trying to seek a monetary gain at the end.<p>any ideas people care to share? some interesting things i've thought of are:
   - a tcp/ip scripting language: basically an interpreter that enabled a user to work at the packet level quickly and easily using simple logical statements depending on what the receiver sends back.<p><pre><code>   - apache syslog: an apache module that sends access logs over syslog (i know there are ways to do this already, but you need to use a pipe to logger and that just seems like crud to me).

   - binary watermarker: something that watermarks executables that makes discovery and tampering extremely difficult (may not be possible, but worth a shot)

   - subversion plug-in to automatically perform static code analysis (may exist, haven't looked very hard).

   - web-based tool for getting yourself or your website/network vulnerability scanned over the internet.</code></pre>	2010-05-30 12:17:45 UTC		9	5	[]

10025210	ask hn: how to fix the headache of telephone haggling?	i wish corporations had their shit together, make it easy on the consumer, but often they don&#x27;t. calling institutions to resolve disputes or handle general maintenance issues is a big waste of time and pain in the ass. familiar with the long wait times when you call corporation x? it&#x27;s especially bad when your question&#x2f;problem is a thirty second (or less) fix&#x2f;solution for the corp. support personnel to provide, because it&#x27;s hugely frustrating to have to deal with waiting thirty minutes for something so simple. 
could a startup solve this? at least fix the easy stuff? 
could it save me the hassle of calling corp x when i need to: change home address, set up payment plans, resolve a charge dispute, request credit increase, change service, file a complaint, etc. etc. etc.	2015-08-07 21:48:11 UTC		2	2	[]

3601479	unity ceo backs kickstarter of code hero, a game to teach game development	today develop magazine's front page stories were: zynga falls 18%, unity ceo backs kickstarter of code hero a game that teaches game development with a code gun, and tim schafer raises $2 million on kickstarter.&#60;p&#62;well i am the founder of code hero in the picture, alex peake, and our kickstarter has blown up today hitting boingboing, techcrunch, thinkgeek and more blogs than i know what to do with.&#60;p&#62;tldr: try code hero and let us know what you think!
http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/primerist/code-hero-a-game-that-teaches-you-to-make-games-he&#60;p&#62;we've accelerated steadily every day since tim schafer raised his million in a single day, mostly because it lit a fire under us to push push push every way we didn't know we knew how to prove that a totally unknown indie can pull off a proportionate success to that of a legend like tim. now we're on track to hit the $100k mark as we have plenty more allies and aces up our sleeve for the media to roll out every day for the next 7 days. everyone in the game industry is talking about the end of publishers and i wonder how much this could be becoming true of other startups.&#60;p&#62;i've experienced twitter storms with my previous projects like http://www.tacticalcorsets.com but this is different, because these backers are downloading code hero and playing it and learning computer programming and talking to us about it!&#60;p&#62;schools have started installing it experimented with using it in classes. some people used it as a job interview challenge and want us to make a jobboss that will take custom challenges like this.&#60;p&#62;i was inspired to make code hero in part by yc and pg. i applied to yc at the beginning of the year, got interviewed, and didn't get accepted. the sleep-when-you-die motivation it instilled in me has been with me ever since. there's a lot i could say about what it took to get here and how buggy the current beta is since compared to what we're building now with our new team it is more of a tech demo, but i would love to know what you all think of it. i live in a noisebridge hackerspace-adjacent hacker house full of team members and cofounders of mine and from other startups yc and otherwise.&#60;p&#62;people obviously compare us to code academy, and they launched their first service in a form that was very similar to something we were close to releasing at the same time. i remember being depressed for a few days at having a tough competitor who i had to respect for their clean design. but then i felt more clear than i had ever before about what we do: code hero is not just a web app. we do something that has never been done before for a gamer audience that is 98% of young people.&#60;p&#62;i recommend code academy to anybody who wants to do web programming since we haven't added that  yet. we're building a video game that's going to turn gamers into coders and we start with the thing that got me and 86% of my hacker friends on the coding path in the first place: making games!&#60;p&#62;code is the new literacy, and we're all working on the same team by promoting that. i consider anybody who encourages code and science literacy to be an ally. code hero has a built-in web browser for doing wysiwyg editing and api referencing that could feature all kinds of other web-based educational tools in an upcoming version.&#60;p&#62;i'd love to hear from code academy's founders and everybody else in this space who wants to talk about our shared cause and the many possible approaches to it.&#60;p&#62;and most of all i'd like to hear from you what you think of code hero. we're aware of 0.192's flaws given that it is still just a prototype compared to what the team is building next, but you can play it and see from our plans on the kickstarter where we're going with this.&#60;p&#62;alex peake

1383231	ask hn: how to plan and manage a large web project?	hello fellow hn readers. i wonder if i can spare 5 minutes of your time, if i may please. 
i have a very large personal web project that i will be developing over the next 6 months. this project is much bigger then anything i've ever done before, and i am really struggling at the moment. 
i want to plan and organise my project in a efficient and logical way so when i hire/fire coders others, and myself can understand everything that is to be done. 
usually i just jot things down in a notebook, or write a to-do list for the smaller projects.<p>i am thinking of using a brainstorming application to help me with this, have each feature of the site on its own branch and then branch off of that with its comments/solutions. could you suggest any good applications for helping me with this? or is there a better way to plan ideas/solutions?<p>i also need to start looking at svn/cvs repositories as i have never used one before to manage revision control of a project. what is the best way to start with this? i have done a little research into subversion and git, but really i am clueless as to which i should learn/use.<p>the last thing i need is bug tracking, i usually just write down bugs i find in my applications in my notebook and fix them as and when. but seeing how large this project is, and the use of multiple programmers. i want to keep everything in one place, so we have an up to date list of bugs and a history of old bugs, should they give us trouble at a later date. what can you suggest for me?<p>i don't know if i have asked the right kind of questions here but i have a million things running through my head at the moment that i just want to manage and develop this project in a correct and professional way. 
if you have any suggestions on the planning, and management of a large web project could you please share them with me?<p>thank you very much for your time and i hope you have a wonderful day!	2010-05-27 11:01:41 UTC		3	6	[]

5555536	sqlalchemy: orm vs. core expression language	i'm in the process of writing a forum-like discussion component for a larger web application, and i am debating on whether or not i should use the full sqlalchemy orm, or just the expression language. using the expression language(the underlying part of sqlalchemy which the orm is built upon), i planned to take a general table data gateway approach (http://martinfowler.com/eaacatalog/tabledatagateway.html), creating simple and light-weight data-access-objects (e.g. usergate, topicgate, postgate, etc) that will serve as the data-access layer.<p>the expression language protects against injection attacks, handles connection pooling, and also provides a nice way of generating the sql queries (e.g. usergate.select(whereclause=(usergate.c.id == userid)).execute() ). however, this approach will certainly necessitate more boilerplate code; i am wondering if this is acceptable since it will use much less internal function calls than the orm.<p>i'd greatly appreciate some feedback, especially from people who have used sqlalchemy core to implement a custom data-access layer.<p>i read this article, but didn't get that much information from it tbh: http://stackful-dev.com/discovering-sqlalchemy-core-the-relational-nosql-api-for-python.html	2013-04-16 01:00:04 UTC		2	0	[]

3494330	ask hn: can i fund an anti-sopa/pipa tv commercial	a quick check of the tos on kickstarter lists "causes" as something they won't allow. i have a question out to actblue.com to see if i can list myself as a donation recipient if i'm not running for any elective office, but do have a message to share.<p>my goal is to make something of an "internet lobby" since we have a relatively quiet voice were it not for the lobbyists that google and other internet companies pay for, as well as their very publicly initiated "black out". i've written a screenplay / script which i intend on posting publicly, prior to production, to solicit feedback and changes from the internet community.<p>some may agree or disagree that this can be effective, but i'm looking for a legal way to accept donations online for which 100% of the funds will be used for getting the "internet" message out to the public and to lawmakers who seldom hear us.	2012-01-21 19:28:31 UTC		1	5	[]

4331861	ask hn: how can i start executing on side projects?	dear wise posters on hn,<p>i am struggling with a situation i am sure many of you have been in. i have a comfortable full time job at a large tech company. i have dreams of entrepreneurship, but i am not yet financially stable enough to leave my job. my goals for the next year are to increase my savings and pay off my debt so that i can be free to choose my own path.<p>i would also like to execute more on the various side projects and ideas i have had kicking around since forever. specifically, i have been learning ios programming as i figure even if i do not produce a highly profitable app, it is a skill that i can monetize through contracting.<p>however, i find myself lacking some impetus when it comes to following through on any of these ideas. i know i need to start executing, rather than getting caught up in an idea for a week and then dropping it for something else, or worse, dropping it and spending the next week playing a videogame in my spare time. one of the reasons is that my full time job leaves me feeling tired and uncreative at the end of the day.<p>how have you managed to successfully execute, to completion, side projects while employed full-time? what motivated you? how did you keep going after the shine had rubbed off?	2012-08-03 00:36:10 UTC		14	14	[]

768220	ask hn: why is concurrent programming so hard ?	this is one of those things that keep coming up over and over again, compared to 'regular' programming programming concurrent (massively parallel) systems is hard.<p>lots harder than the simple relation between the number of threads of execution and a single thread should make you suspect.<p>unless your problem is one that is easily parallelized you are left with limited alternatives.<p>usually this is put down to either architectural issues (von neumann vs alternatives), sometimes to the difficulties of locking and such, most times to how easy a program can be parallelized.<p>but even the latter is an effort on the part of the programmer, rarely of the environment the program is written in (though there are some interesting developments in that area).<p>i have this weird theory that it has to do with something completely different:<p>our brains are not wired to have 'multiple parallel threads' of consciousness.<p>so we have a hard time envisioning in our sequentially wired brains what is going on in a parallel program, which means we feel much more 'at home' in a sequential environment.<p>it takes a good bit of training to get around that limitation and even then it is not easy.<p>so we tend to 'break up' our programs into sequential pieces of code, each running in parallel with the rest, and the spots where they meet, like trains using a railroad track, have to be scheduled to make things execute in the proper sequence.<p>this makes me wonder if we are truly capable of devising a method of parallel execution that will feel 'natural'.<p>even in the real world, when we 'concentrate' we single out a thread from all the possible inputs and go step-by-step to analyze that one single process.<p>what are your thoughts on this ?	2009-08-17 14:55:48 UTC		8	11	[]

41261	idea: mechanical turk for page usability testing?	my company provides a very unique service -- one that is difficult to explain properly in a few words.<p>as i've worked on designing our web site (particularly the homepage), it occurred to me that it would be nice to be able to do some simple testing with something like the mechanical turk: submit a web page to the service, which would flash it in front of a tester for 5-10 seconds, and then have the tester answer questions about their comprehension of the site's purpose and benefits, and perhaps their own objections or responses. (more in-depth testing processes wouldn't be difficult, but that's the first one that comes to mind for me)<p>i'm working in a pretty unique environment right now -- the market is somewhat small and difficult to target, but ridiculously high-margin (we're looking at creating $500+ profit per user within 1 week of sign-up, essentially.).<p>with low traffic, it's hard to get solid numbers out of page variation testing, and in a wholly new market, i don't even know if most visitors understand our service, so i see the value in turk-ish testing for myself, but i'm not sure if it would have a broad appeal. would any of you find mechanical turk-based usability testing valuable?	2007-08-10 15:12:27 UTC		2	1	[]

4231424	ask hn: i want to charge in my web application, what to do legally?	i am a non-us citizen and started creating a web application. i want to charge credit cards in the website, but i don't think it will bring big amounts of revenue - let's say $100 per month. i want to do this not for the money (although if possible, why not), but more for the sake of it. i have no idea what i should do legally. i want to charge internationally - having customers in europe and the us. should i incorporate? does it matter where?<p>i'm asking it in the simplest form as i honestly don't know where to start here. i don't want to pay hundreds of dollars on legal/accounting counseling or hundreds of dollars for incorporation just for a small project that if successful will only be worth a few hundred dollars for me. what do i need to do to legally charge and issue receipts worldwide online?<p>edit: to clarify, i have a paypal account (premier, not business as i don't have a registered business), but the question is not about how technically to charge and process credit cards, but what do i need to do to make it fully compliant with the law (particularly american and eu law).	2012-07-11 20:57:01 UTC		2	2	[]

7012421	electronic bank robberies - stealing money from atms with malware	 published on dec 29, 2013<p>electronic bank robberies
stealing money from atms with malware<p>this talk will discuss a case in which criminals compromised and robbed an atm by infecting it with specially crafted malware. the successful compromise of an atm can easily result in the loss of several hundred thousand dollars.
most automated teller machines (atms) run regular windows systems and can be controlled like any other computer. the first public demonstration of an atm hack was given in 2010 - but how bad is this threat really? it turns out there is a multi-million dollar business behind atm hacks. this talk reveals how these criminal gangs operate by disclosing information obtained through forensic analysis of a real compromise. in the analyzed case some malware was used to control the hacked machine that was written specifically for the targeted atm brand. by reverse-engineering this malware, we gained unique insights into the technologies used by the intruders. the malicious features range from balance monitoring over cash-out commands to the wiping of the machine to cover up traces of the attack. they can be accessed through special number codes that are entered directly via the machine&#x27;s number pad. hooking techniques and overlay windows are used to display the status of the system on the atm monitor. we will further discuss that operations of this scale can only be performed by professional crime groups that not only have the technical capabilities to develop such special malware, but also have access to insider information about the design of atms and who know how the targeted banks operate.	2014-01-04 19:10:20 UTC	https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=0c08EYv4N5A	1	0	[]

1808784	ask hn: why doesn't apple buy adobe?	i've long wondered why apple doesn't buy adobe.<p>the two companies have a long and storied history together going back to the good old days when adobe created/supplied the postscript printer language, not to mention display postscript used in the next computer built by jobs; but the reality is apple has always needed adobe more than the other way around.<p>with the recent news that microsoft and adobe are getting chummy together, i would think this is a perfect opportunity for apple to buy adobe.  they could even site the potential damage of a rumored purchase from microsoft as primary reason for the move (a pre-emtive strike).<p>the creative suite as an apple product would round out their professional software offering nicely alongside logic and final cut. not only would this protect apple from adobe becoming a microsoft exclusive, they would be able to make the mac version of adobe products either mac exclusive or at the very least the top priority. the would also have ownership of flash, which i have to believe would almost be worth it alone.  all together i'd think this is a huge win-win for apple.<p>so why not? anti-trust? it would seem they (apple) are such a small fish in the over-all pc market, anti-trust just doesn't add up to me.	2010-10-19 21:12:58 UTC		6	3	[]

1601084	ask hn: how much should i ask for?	i'm posting this under a throwaway account in order to give details.  from this thread - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1591225 - it seems people like discussing money here so i wanted to ask for input.<p>i've been contacted by a place i've worked for before about hiring me on a contract.  this would be the fourth time i have done work for them.  the first two times i was working as an employee - i quit to go do something not software related, came back and then got laid off.  the third time i was hired on contract.<p>as an employee, the first two times, i earned $23/hr (there would have been benefits on top of that but i never made it past the probation period).<p>for the contract, i asked for $36/hr and it was accepted.<p>since then, i have been working on a contract at another place and earning $45/hr.  this contract will end soon (or be reduced to just a few hours per week).<p>this company does client work which they bill at approximately $100/hr  so i know there is a limit to what financially makes sense to them no matter how good my work is.<p>i was thinking of asking for $55/hr this time around but that seems like a huge jump from their point of view when i was earning $36/hr at my last contract with them - just six months ago.<p>i should note that not getting the contract wouldn't be a bad thing.  i would be interested in having the free time for a while to work on my own projects.<p>i would be interested in hearing other people's viewpoints.	2010-08-13 15:02:52 UTC		18	27	[]

115326	hack idea: text classification for political propaganda	reading the campaign material of political candidates in order to figure out what they stand for is a rather annoying exercise.  invariably, they're 95% fluff.  look at<p>http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/issues/65bd0fbe-737b-4851-a7e7-d9a37cb278db.htm .<p>it isn't my intent to pick on mccain, but this makes a good example.  these five paragraphs are almost but not quite semantically null.  i can glean from the first paragraph that he believes in man-made global warming, and from the fourth paragraph that he supports nuclear energy.  this is useful information, but having to parse five paragraphs to discover it seems inefficient.<p>i think text classifiers might be able to improve this process.  "nuclear energy" seems like it would be a pretty strong ham token, while "for our children" and "addressing the challenges" seem pretty spammy.  trying this out is not quite as simple as just feeding things into crm114, because we're trying to classify parts of messages rather than complete messages.  it ought to possible to work around that, though: perhaps score each clause, each sentence, and each paragraph, and then somehow derive an overall score from these inputs.<p>anyone think this could work?	2008-02-13 23:11:46 UTC		15	18	[]

1791405	review my startup - gobuzz.com	my startup recently launched a new online application called gobuzz. gobuzz is a news monitoring and email alert service. gobuzz can monitor news in an industry or relating to a topic (for example, "acquisitions in the biomedical industry"). whenever we see news about this topic we will email you.<p>additionally, gobuzz will monitor a large list of contacts and companies in the news.<p>the industry and topic alerts are great for finding new prospects in your industry. gobuzz will attempt to identify names and companies in an article which can be quickly added to your contact list for further monitoring and prospecting. we may also be able to identify a social network profile for them.<p>unlike google alerts (the first question on everyone's mind), gobuzz...<p><pre><code>    * allows you to search for high level concepts such as an industry or topic, rather than low-level keyword search queries
    * makes search very person-oriented. the name, company, and location of your contact influences what we send to you. you can add keywords as you see fit to differentiate between john smith the felon and your john smith, the highly regarded client.
    * makes monitoring a huge list of contacts very easy (just upload it). ever try setting up more than 30 google alerts?
    * can identify names and companies in new articles, along with social network profiles which can help your contact list grow.
</code></pre>
you can create a free industry and topic alert.  monitoring contacts costs $24.95/mo.<p>we are based in madison, wi and have been in business for a year and a half. i've been a hn user for a little over two years now and look forward to your insight and feedback. thanks for your help!	2010-10-14 16:07:44 UTC		3	3	[]

2. let the community vote on the idea<p>the goal would be obviously to develop a business but also to share 100% of what we do to get customers, how we build the product and everything in between.  100% bare all.<p>would this be something that startup founders would be interested in seeing?  if so would you prefer option 1 or 2 above?	2015-03-26 18:56:56 UTC		8	5	[]

4151954	ask hn: is restful purity too chatty for http?	hello fellow hackers, i posted this question on so and codingforums a few days ago and have no replies yet.<p>rest principles dictate that when a resource is created or updated (post/put), the response body should contain a representation of the transaction result, along with a location header of the new resource, etc. while this is all good and well, it pretty much forces you to re-request the resource to get its current state, but http requests are not free - far from it. is there an accepted approach to deal with this?<p>it would seem appropriate to return both a location header and an xml or json structure in the body to avoid a wasteful second ajax request. the body can then use an envelope/namespace similar to soap that would separate any transaction response message from the resource representation itself.<p>originally asked here:

4136451	jack dorsey’s 28.3% square ownership gives him 75% control.	hi all, hn newbie here :). i was invited as a yc finalist back in april for our business which revolves around measuring shareholder control. some of you told me you thought the community would find the link interesting, so i’m happy to oblige:<p>http://www.rotarygallop.com/2/post/2012/06/ownership-and-control-at-square.html<p>while the headline is control at square, i hope as fellow entrepreneur’s you’ll takeaway a few more broad points:<p>-unless it is zero or greater than 50% , your percentage ownership reveals exactly nothing about your control.<p>-sophisticated entrepreneurs and venture capitalists know this much, which is why they often advise letting control take care of itself. what they don't know is that the story doesn’t end there. (almost no one knows this including activist’s investors i've worked with who take over companies for a living.)<p>-control is not soft and fuzzy. it is definable, measurable, and manageable. just like all the other metrics that drive your business, you can measure it, make decisions and move on.<p>talk to me in the comments!	2012-06-20 11:09:02 UTC		65	32	[]

8416010	ask hn: service idea generation for audio?	i have an old project which offers an (outdated) opensource software for podcasting. i did not continue with development when the interest in podcast fell and other solutions emerged.<p>however, i still feel that i should now come up with something more useful. in other words: i do not want to completely abandon the project but instead build a completely other thing.<p>in the early days of the project, i found that musicians were a major audience of the project. so i built a contest website for artists and wanted to produce a cd. reponse was bad.<p>the next idea was to build something for &quot;open source&quot; music. something like jamendo did. i did not complete my prototype, but then jamendo was on its way of becoming the number one in that niche, so i did not continue with that idea, either.<p>the 2nd attempt was podcasting-as-a-platform where i was outpaced by soundcloud.<p>however, the next idea was soon there: enable people to sell their digital goods, especially their music. however, in that case, a lawyer convinced me that this would not be worth the risk in my legislation.<p>i must admit that my list of &quot;missed chances&quot; may read as a list of procrastination. the thing is that i always wanted the project to be a side project. so i put less effort in the ideas than i should have.<p>for now, my feelings are a bit ambivalent: on the one hand, it would be ok to simply abandon the internet-audio ideas and keep on with my other projects and client works. but on the other hand, i really like the internet-audio-sphere.<p>however, i run out of ideas somehow. i am not asking the question to get ready-to-run business ideas in that sphere. but maybe you can ask the right questios, point me to something you find annoying in the audio-on-the-net-sphere or you may find yourself in a similar situation and share thoughts or even start building something together. in that last case, it would be great if you leave your contact details in your answer.	2014-10-06 14:28:08 UTC		1	0	[]
3604301	ask hn: what's the best way to implement multiple oauth authentication?	my team is working on a new project and we wanted to implement facebook and twitter oauth verifications on top of the traditional email and password verification. we looked around on the web and setting up access keys to facebook and twitter are both pretty easy to figure out.<p>my question is, if a user registers via twitter, adds some data to the system, logs out; and some time later decides to register via facebook, how would the system know to combine those two separate registrations into one account? is there a best practice for this exact problem already posted somewhere on the web?<p>thanks in advance!	2012-02-17 18:08:10 UTC		7	4	[]

6007139	ask hn: review my app – sbscribe, a social rss feed reader (google reader alt)	hi everyone,<p>the people who use rss today are power users. by the general user, twitter is used as a replacement service for rss by allowing people to follow websites. twitter was not designed for this.<p>briefly: sbscribe is as easy to use as twitter, but powered by rss and tailored for discovering and sharing content in one interface.<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;vimeo.com&#x2f;69376016<p>for all the content you currently discover and monitor using bookmarks, rss feed readers like google reader, and social networks such as twitter — sbscribe offers the same experience, in one place.<p>this is an idea i had three years ago when i realised the value of socially curated news through platforms such as twitter and facebook. at the same time, i noticed my non-technical friends were &#x27;following&#x27; websites on twitter. sbscribe really aims to separate these two concerns — you follow people, and subscribe to websites. it has been in development since january.<p>i&#x27;m planning on launching a private alpha of sbscribe in august some time (shortly followed by a public beta in october), and i&#x27;ve got a slew of ideas for how i can improve the &quot;subscription graph&quot;, as well as plans for a mobile web app. i&#x27;ve gotten to a point where i would really appreciate some feedback on improving the concept and ui. it&#x27;s also a good time to spread the message with the recent shutdown of google reader.<p>fyi: the service is backed by node.js, mongodb, and redis, and on the front-end i am using backbone.js and marionette.js. it would also be great to talk with other developers familiar with this stack.<p>oliver	2013-07-08 15:11:28 UTC		38	13	[]

3814264	migrating classic asp to asp.net mvc. should i?	we currently have a web site using around 20 classic asp pages. i’m looking to migrate the asp pages to asp.net mvc as i think this would be a good platform since we have been using microsoft products for about 10 years. i am not familiar with asp.net so this is going to be a pretty huge undertaking for me. i’ve been tasked to come up with the number of hours and approximate costs to do this conversion.<p>i have a couple of questions;
1) in educating myself with asp.net, i’m reading that most bloggers etc. are using c#. i was hoping to use my vb skills but know i’m thinking it might make sense to use c#. (only because everyone seems to be doing so. ) do you agree?
2) what’s the best way to figure out how to size this beast? learn asp.net mvc enough to figure it out myself or hire someone to do it for me. i’m thinking hiring someone.
3) lastly, do you agree that asp.net mvc would be the best choice for us?<p>thank you for your time.	2012-04-08 16:59:00 UTC		1	4	[]

2326266	energy talk: nuclear vs coal. but what about wind, water, sun?	due to recent events, i've witnessed a few twitter fights debating nuclear safety, viability, and coal energy.<p>but i'm wondering why people discuss water, wind, and sun energy less seriously. where i live, we have an option to get a major chunk of our home's energy from these sources. (and yes, i use this option.)<p>i've always assumed that these three sources (nicknamed "renewable" in oregon power companies) just suffered from the "organic catch-22." there's not much of it, because people don't buy it, because there's not much of it, because people don't buy it.<p>but in the back of my mind, i assumed that if infrastructure slowly moved over, we could actually live in a world run by this stuff.<p>i've also seen and read about very big businesses powered by these energy sources.<p>but now i'm feeling like an ignorant dork. people who i respect don't even bring up the renewable trio when discussing nuclear vs coal energy. i can only assume there's something really inefficient about them that everybody knows about except for me.<p>anybody truly informed about it wanna chime in? though i may ask further questions, i am not trying to start anything contentious.	2011-03-15 06:16:54 UTC		2	3	[]
