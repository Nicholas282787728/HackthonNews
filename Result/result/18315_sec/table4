7628856	what’s it like to have lower eyelid surgery?	cosmetic eyelid surgery is one of the more common cosmetic procedures chosen to reduce the appearance of aging and restore a more youthful countenance. lower lid bags can be corrected with transconjunctival blepharoplasty where an incision is made on the inside of the lower eyelid and excess fat and skin are removed. the procedure is virtually painless and done in a doctor’s office with a local anesthetic. following the cosmetic procedures, your doctor will apply an ointment and possibly bandage your eyes. you recover at home within days, keeping your head elevated, icing your eyes, keeping your eyes clean, and re-applying the ointment as directed. stitches are removed in 5-7 days and scarring will be nearly invisible in six months.	2014-04-22 17:03:56 UTC	http://myrontanenbaummd.com/faq/	1	0

137481	startup idea: web2.0 rendez-vous organizer 	i've seen a startup here in france offering a web service allowing customer to pick themselves the appointment date. they login and the free slot agenda is presented to them. they can then reserve the time slot they want or change it later. this avoids blind and long discussion through phone with the secretary. of course the client is given a password controlled access so that he is identified. this service was sold but was far too expensive. a freemium business model should be offered instead.<p>another very useful service is the one provided for free (with ads) by www.doodle.ch allowing for a group of people to converge (by vote) on a meeting date. it is nice to have it free, but in a company we would prefer one without ads and hosted internally for confidentiality. a company would certainly be ready to pay for such an application. beside i'm quite sure a more user friendly and ergonomic interface could be invented.	2008-03-15 11:15:37 UTC		1	0

9816566	stock options cliff and corp/vc reputation	i was recently fired from a startup just before the one-year anniversary. because the stock option plan had a one-year cliff i didn&#x27;t get to keep any options. i was surprised to find out that this is not uncommon. with hardly any effort i discovered three similar cases of senior people with amazing backgrounds getting fired before the one year anniversary. clearly, companies can get away with behavior like this because few people are going to talk publicly about getting fired.<p>what would be the best way to track a company or vc reputation? glassdoor may work for large companies but doesn&#x27;t seem to work for smaller ones. since the state gov already tracks employment, why not make those statistics public? this can include number of employees hired&#x2f;fired per category, compensation range, gender, age, benefits offered, stock options, sr staff turnover and perhaps other useful stats. we regulate info to buy a company stock, why not do the same for the labor market?<p>i know that the political systems is mostly run by corporations but why can&#x27;t we think of a better system that will make the labor market more transparent and fair? after all, good reputable companies will benefit from transparency. in california we vote for lots of silly propositions, why not proposing something useful.<p>finally, what is the rationale for the 1-year cliff other than screw employees? why do we make it so easy for a corporation to fire someone? i don&#x27;t think it should be too hard but there should be a process and more balance and it should have a higher cost for companies (unless they are truly out of $). perhaps employment agreements should be standardized and made public so critics can review them.<p>because of lack of transparency individuals are at a disadvantage unless we change the rules of the game though the democratic process.<p>anyone out there has similar feelings&#x2f;thoughts? are there any meetups where people talk about these issues?	2015-07-02 02:40:39 UTC		1	0

9103200	i’ll build you android ui prototypes for free this and next week	from tomorrow through march 6, i’ll spend 4 hours per day converting your app ui mockups (psd, sketch, pixate, framer.js etc.) to full-fidelity, native and interactive prototypes (some examples here: http:&#x2f;&#x2f;jimulabs.com&#x2f;services&#x2f;). i’ll send you all the layouts, resources and code that you can reuse for further development. no matter if it’s a material redesign, ios-to-android ports or a completely new design. no strings attached. you or your company own all the rights for the work.  i might ask you for the permission to publish a video of your interfaces but feel free to deny if you want to keep it confidential. we can sign an nda if you prefer.<p>why am i doing this? i’m building a tool to make it easy to create full-fidelity, <i>development-reusable</i> ui prototypes of native android apps. i think building interfaces for real apps is not only an effective means of field testing, but also a great way to connect with potential users. besides, i’d be more than happy to take over the rest of the development of the app on a contract if you like my work (i’ve been building android apps since 2007). critiques and comments welcomed!<p>to ensure that i have enough time to finish something useful for you, i’ll put a limit on the number of clients.  but i’d love to chat with you and i might consider future offerings if this works well.<p>shoot me an email at linton at jimulabs dot com! upvote this and i’d really appreciate it. :) thanks!<p>ps: if you are in victoria&#x2f;vancouver canada, or seattle or sf bay area, it’d be great to meet up and have a coffee. i’m based in victoria and planning to make a trip to seattle&#x2f;sf in the next month or two. it’d be great to meet fellow entrepreneurs, developers and designers to exchange ideas and share stories. ping me!	2015-02-24 20:16:22 UTC		1	0

1537036	ask hn: minimizing ram usage: dropbear vs openssh?	i've been using openssh for years now, but in looking at ways to reduce memory usage (i keep hitting 256mb on a 256mb slice) on my vps, i saw a post glorifying dropbear, as compared to openssh. he didn't find anything he didn't do normally with openssh that dropbear couldn't do, which inclines mean to use dropbear. i haven't found a complete feature list for dropbear, one that i could compare to openssh's. does anyone else have any information?<p>and somewhat related, does anyone have any tips on minimizing ram, or any other resource, usage?

9939862	ask hn: what reaction is expectable from the atomized reactants?	let we have a reaction that starts from some reactants to produce some products. when the activation energy is provided to the reactants they will be atomized and produce a gas of individual atoms. the gas contain the whole atoms that can either form again the reactants, or form the products, or instead form the elemental molecules of themselves from which the reactants or products can be produced in other reactions. now that the gas of all individual atoms is common for all these different reactions my question is what conditions decide which reaction to happen?<p>can i say the reaction happens in the direction at which the gibbs free enthalpy decreases more rapidly? or thermodynamic conditions (like temperature, pressure and especially concentration of the species) also play a role therein, independent of the variation in the gibbs function?<p>thanks	2015-07-24 02:45:06 UTC		1	0
3729884	if you use vi-mode under bash, and you miss esc-dot, ctrl-a, ctrl-e, etc	i recently found out about vi-mode under bash:<p><pre><code>    set -o vi
</code></pre>
i love it - but there's a problem: over the years i've formed "muscle memory" for the default bash (actually, readline) shortcuts:<p><pre><code>    "esc-." will reproduce my last line's last argument
    "ctrl-a" will take me to the line's beginning
    "ctrl-e" will take me to the line's end
    "ctrl-w" deletes the word before the cursor
    "ctrl-l" clears the screen
</code></pre>
these obviously don't work in vi-mode - "esc-." for example switches to vi command mode (because of esc) and then "." repeats the last inserted word.<p>after a bit of research, i found a way to have my cake and eat it too - this is what you need in your .bashrc:<p><pre><code>    set -o vi
    bind -m vi-command ".":insert-last-argument
    bind -m vi-insert "\c-l.":clear-screen
    bind -m vi-insert "\c-a.":beginning-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert "\c-e.":end-of-line
    bind -m vi-insert "\c-w.":backward-kill-word
</code></pre>
this way, the shortcuts i've been using for decades still work - and i can still switch to vi command mode (with esc) and enjoy the immense powers of vi.<p>granted, i am losing a bit of functionality (e.g. the repeating of a series of commands with a single '.') ; but if you are like me, you'll prefer this tradeoff.<p>p.s. if you need further commands to replicate, just look them up in "man bash" (search for "readline command names").	2012-03-20 15:54:36 UTC		1	0

2302483	why isn't singapore as entrepreneurial as israel? [part 1 - technology]	over the next few days, i hope to publish a 4-part series on answering the question: why isn't singapore as entrepreneurial as israel?<p>it is a mystery, especially for a singaporean like me. both nations have limited natural resources, rely heavily on its manpower for its growth. yet, why is it that the singapore government is struggling to make its citizen create its own jobs?<p>back in may 2010, i had the opportunity to embark on a 10-days trip to israel, to investigate the reasons behind its entrepreneurial economy.<p>introduction:<p>from my internship stint at the singapore's ministry of trade, i learnt about successful israel’s yozma fund, and unsuccessful tif ventures in singapore. ever since then, i realized that the singapore government has been mimicking what the israeli government does. i signed up for israel bsm to find out the real reasons behind israel’s booming entrepreneurship ecosystem and why singapore is not on par. on the 26th april, as i boarded the plane to tel aviv, all geared up to answer two main questions – (1) what were the historical differences that led to the today’s difference in entrepreneurship culture; (2) is singapore on the right track on becoming where israel is today. as identified by asaf barnea, ceo of kinrot ventures, apart from funding, there are three main factors that make a start-up – technology, market needs and people. in reflection of the historical differences between israel and singapore, i will be structuring my thoughts around these four main factors.<p>innovation &#38; education<p>as we visited the biblical and historical sites, i realized that the israelis’ ability to innovate and cater to underserved markets was a result of necessity. agriculture and water technologies were developed in response to daily survival consumption needs. for example, during the canaanites inhabitation, an extensive water tunnel was built to access water from the faraway gihon spring. in addition, being the geographical land bridge between africa, europe and asia, and the centre of religious conflicts, the nation was constantly attacked. these military threats and pivotal moments such as the french embargo on israel caused the nation to kick-start its own defence technologies. singapore on the other hand, had a less pressing need to innovate for self-sustenance. during the starting years, our homeland was fortunate to have a tropical climate for fruits and access to seawater for water and fish. singapore has also been far less experienced in warfare. even in times of war, it was the british government who provided majority of the weapons and manpower needed.<p>there are however, two traits that are similar for both israel and singapore. firstly, both countries placed high importance of education. due to the jewish religious purposes, traditionally, boys were made to study religious text in a comprehensive manner from a very young age. this practice is still present in modern times. even david, our tour guide, has ever brought his son up to the mountains to study the bible together. this attitude towards education has its immense impact on entrepreneurship in modern times. in technion university, we were introduced to the president of the entrepreneurship club who at only 28 years old has over 10 years of experience in start-ups. his secret was that at 6 years old, he was already reading his father’s computer programming books. singapore, being an asia country, had also placed strong emphasis on education in their children. however, unlike the israelis, during the 1940s to 1960s, prior to entering formal school, parents emphasized on their children hands-on skills to work or help at the family business.<p>talent pool<p>last but not least, both countries had an influx of foreigners. during the fifth aliyah movement, many diasporas returned from germany and austria as professionals in the field of medicine, science, finance and arts. this propelled the agriculture and high-tech industry in israel. singapore’s immigrants however, were mostly uneducated, with backgrounds in commerce, textiles and labour-intensive industries. there could have been insufficient individuals with technical know-how to spin off a high-tech industry even if they wanted to.<p>next post: comparison on "people and market needs"	2011-03-08 20:32:42 UTC	http://geekomaniac.com/	1	0

484514	gizmox's visual webgui platform remains unhackable after 3-month security challenge	more than 1,700 users unsuccessfully attempted to break into the visual webgui pipeline<p>tel aviv, israel —february 17, 2009—gizmox, www.visualwebgui.com, developer of  the visual webgui rapid application development program, today announced that no one was able to successfully hack into the visual webgui platform during the security challenge sponsored by the company that offered a $10,000 prize to anyone who could break into the visual webgui framework. the contest, which ran from november 3, 2008 through january 31, 2009, required participants to provide a reproducible pathway into the visual webgui pipeline in order to claim the prize. despite break-in attempts by more than 1,700 users, visual webgui was not hacked and the prize remains unclaimed.<p>according to leading it analysts, web applications and in particular ria technology based applications have become the most vulnerable elements of enterprise it infrastructure. as an increasing number of organizations come to depend on rich internet-based applications that leverage the power of ajax, silverlight, or flash technologies, businesses must find ways to secure their web applications and protect sensitive data that can be exposed on the server through the use of these technologies.<p>the visual webgui "empty client" architecture is designed to simplify, enhance, and protect the deployment of complex, data centric, and ultra rich ajax and silverlight user interface (ui) for the enterprise level. the empty client approach means the entire application flow, ui logic, and validations are developed and processed on the server and virtualized on the browser, while the web browser serves as a “display” for the output and a “receptor” for user input. with visual webgui's empty client architecture, only essential ui data is sent to the client, which includes no applicative or sensitive data, preventing the break in and theft of confidential information on the server. through the gizmox security challenge, visual webgui's "empty client" architecture has been proven to provide bullet-proof security to both ajax and silverlight applications deployed atop visual webgui.<p>"no company has ever challenged people to break into their system. the fact that no one was able to successfully hack into the visual webgui pipeline demonstrates not only our belief in visual webgui's air-tight security, but proves that rich internet applications developed with visual webgui are inherently safe and secure by design," said navot peled, ceo and founder of gizmox. "as the empty client name indicates, the client holds no data or logic, and every action the client wants to take must be authorized by the server first. not only does this significantly increase security, but the empty client design allows events to be raised on the server for every client action while also remaining flexible enough to make web applications responsive, scalable and customizable, enhancing the end-user experience."<p>visual webgui is an open source ria development &#38; deployment platform atop standard .net. visual webgui enables software developers to create and deploy rich enterprise level applications with "bullet proof" military grade security and desktop responsiveness which is virtualized on a standard browser with no specific installation. the on-server architecture allows users to develop rich web applications with winforms methodologies and deploy to the web as ajax or silverlight applications, cutting development time up to a proven 90%. in addition, visual webgui allows users to port existing desktop applications to the web with just push of a button. the visual webgui empty client employs javascript, xsl and css to deliver ui's that look, feel, and behave like their desktop counterparts, allowing for the creation a of a true desktop experience on the web. ria development and deployment with visual webgui provides an incredibly flat learning curve for windows developers who feel more at home programming in visual basic, c#, and other desktop native programs, allowing enterprises to leverage existing staff, skills, software assets, and infrastructure to provide an overall faster time to market and reduced development costs in time and labor. during an economic downturn, visual webgui's cost saving value provides a strategic advantage to enterprises that are seeking cost-efficient technologies that can enhance existing it capabilities. 
about gizmox<p>gizmox, the developer of visual webgui open source platform and a member of microsoft's visual studio industry partner (vsip) program was founded in july 2007. gizmox enables web like desktop platforms; its sdk has been downloaded by over 300,000 individuals and software houses with more than 25,000 active community members. more than 30,000 vwg applications have been built, and are in production at enterprises such as sap, ibm, israel aerospace industry, 3 out of 4 leading israeli banks, 4 out of 6 leading israeli insurance companies, government offices, and multi-national companies such as trysis, networkd, net size, american file net, phoenix insurance company, blue phoenix, texas instrument and many more.  the company is funded by venture capital and private investors. its one of the founders and active chairman of the board is professor arie scope founder of microsoft's israel subsidiary, and its former general manager and chairman for 16 years.	2009-02-17 14:42:11 UTC		1	0

4630320	landing an internship in sf bay with 1 year of cs?	i am a freshman at a private liberal arts university in the midwest. my school has a good reputation, but not for computer science. on top of that, i am in a horrible location to find good internships in the tech industry. my goal is to move to the sf bay area, find a good internship, and continue my education out there. i have been learning programming since the start of my senior year in high school, so i have more experience than many first year cs students. i also have done some web development with django and jquery. i feel i have python down pretty well for my level (i know it much better than java-which all of my cs classes are taught in here). i also know html and css fairly well, and have put together some basic sites using this and javascript which i am still learning. i have been exposed to some web services, and have one website using amazon's ec2 and s3.<p>so this is basically the technical experience i have, i feel i have a decent foundation but i know i am lacking depth. part of this problem is my location, my university doesn't have many opportunities to get out in the community and work on projects. there is no motivation to start projects/businesses/etc. it definitely has a focus on problem solving rather than building things, and then solving the problems we encounter. this is why i want to change locations. i really want to get in to the start up scene, and i would love to be a part of a tech driven community. right now i am focusing on adding some depth to my skills by working on some more python/django projects. what is the market like in the bay area for someone with skills like me, could i get an internship, would i be able to get a paid internship that could turn in to a job? what other tips do you have for me in this situation? thanks in advance!	2012-10-09 06:51:18 UTC		1	2

right now i have more than 40 project ideas and 546 new issues (mostly feature ideas) in my private tracker which i would like to implement (lol).<p>writing them down as david allen suggests in gtd helped a ton, really. once i write them down, they don&#x27;t come back as much, because i know they are in a good place and won&#x27;t get lost but still, if i don&#x27;t jot down an idea immediately as it pops into my mind, it just doesn&#x27;t let me do my job...<p>another good practice is to try to focus on one thing and one thing only and do only that and don&#x27;t bother anything else. (e.g. one project at a time)<p>i read a couple of articles in the topic but i still have this problem from time to time, and sometimes, i just can&#x27;t focus on what i need to do right now, because of them.<p>if you suffered from this, how did you overcome by it? what techniques could you stop them popping into your mind? how could you forget or not deal with them and increase your focus on what needs to be done instead of daydreaming?	2014-04-29 02:45:26 UTC		1	2

5690468	ask hn: does nobody offer domain registration with customisable dns presets?	i've had a very frustrating morning wading through different "domain reseller" options from pretty much all of the major hosts. none of them seem to offer dns templates.<p>i run a hosted cms which my customers can link a domain to. at the moment i have to hold their hands through editing their dns records and pointing to my servers. this is probably the biggest weight on customer service. i don't want to have to code a whole dns management interface and i don't really care about making money on the domains. all i want is for them to be able to buy a domain and have the a and cname records already set up.<p>i haven't found anybody who does this. surely i'm not alone in this? does anybody have any quick-win solutions?<p>maybe this is a start-up idea for somebody.<p>thanks in advance	2013-05-11 12:58:38 UTC		1	3

2701181	ask hn: is this a feasible business idea?	a couple weeks ago i had an idea for a new service, but i'm not sure it's something others would find useful or if it would be accepted as an authority.<p>basically, what i'm thinking is a service where people could do things like store notes, pictures, recordings, etc. and each item would be stored in such a way so that it could not be later altered (was thinking mysql archive tables).<p>for example, the idea came to mind when my wife moved out a few weeks ago. every time we have a conversation i feel like i need to document it, e.g. "just spoke with x and stated that abc" and have that stored on a server of a non-biased company somewhere so that if the situation gets to the point of legal counsel being brought in i could put together a sort of log or journal of what's been said and when.<p>if this was something that could be useful, i could build out mobile apps that could take recordings and submit those or even automatically forward text messages from selected individuals. i would, of course, want something like triple redundancy on the databases to ensure nothing is lost.<p>but, like i said earlier, i'm not sure such a service would be helpful to others or if lawyers/courts would even consider the information worthwhile or admissible.<p>what say ye, all wise hn community? :)	2011-06-27 13:19:34 UTC		1	7

2888750	ask hn: how do you know that you like it?	hi/<p>i have a problem<p>if you do not want to read everything, here's the big question: how do you know in life, what hobby that you like just outside, not what you'd like to do all your life?<p>i do not know what i like. more precisely i can not decide.
i like web design, i like interesting, well laid out sites that nicely, with good typography, for example, make purchases (in an ideal area for me it is com www.bhphotovideo.com).
i know a little bit html and css, a little photoshop. 
but the point is this. 
i want to make my own online store. i want a nice, beautiful, fast, convenient online store. i know that once everything is unlikely to succeed, but the dream is to be =) 
so. i understand that the site that will satisfy me in every way will not make any one studio, and if one that does - is will not available for me financially. 
it turns out that i have come up design and make your own. 
but, damn it, i do not know where to start! 
pumped a lot of lessons on lynda.com dreamviewer, slowly learning ..<p>another point - i do not want make sites all my life. i do not want to be a freelancer. i want to do projects that introduce them to life, and drove off. and i most emphatically is not clear whether or not to learn web design or have any other outlets ..
in general, it turns out some unfinished post.<p>hackers! motivate me! or discourage! 
thank you please!<p>sorry for my english, it is not my native language.	2011-08-15 21:17:26 UTC		1	-1

5238063	ask hn: to give away (or not) your code after a kaggle competition	let's imagine you are one of the prize winners, but that you did play the competition to benchmark your own code. if this code is under your company's license for instance, kaggle prizes may often be too low for you to grant the competition sponsor a full right to use and reproduce your code. my understanding is that refusing the prize does disqualify you, and that's it!

1770759	ad hoc synchronization considered harmful	this research paper appears in osdi 2010. it thoroughly studies ad hoc synchronization from many real world applications and concludes that ad hoc synchronizations cause all kinds of problems, including bugs, performance issues and misleading concurrency bug detection tools. it also finds that ad hoc synchronizations are implemented in many various ways, thus very hard to be recognized. because of this, the authors developed a tool, called syncfinder, that automatically annotates ad hoc synchronizations in source code.<p>the full paper can be downloaded from http://www.usenix.org/events/osdi10/tech/full_papers/xiong.pdf. it's from the opera research group at ucsd (http://opera.ucsd.edu/).<p>should we stop using ad hoc synchronization? do we need better synchronization libraries? what's your opinion on this?	2010-10-08 05:38:38 UTC		2	0

2007612	ask hn: should i hire va or continue to do-it-myself?	here's my situation.<p>i launched a stocks alert service ( http://tradesalerts.com ) in nov 2010, and deleted domains service ( http://nameego.com ) in dec 2010. both sites require me to run a few processes and create the corresponding email newsletter and send it out on a daily basis. this usually used up all my time in the morning and i am left with just the afternoon to work on the marketing and improving the core features.<p>i hope to outsource the routine work, but with zero revenue coming in yet. it just dun make sense to outsource. i tried macros, but sadly the newsletter to be created require some analysis work.<p>anyone else in the same shoes? what should i do? hire va. or continue to do-it-myself?	2010-12-15 09:59:19 UTC		2	0

257736	ask hn: way to map one database schema to another?	i recently wrote a new version of a fairly popular web application. version 1.0 was written in php and version 2.0 is now python/django.<p>i need a way to get my user data from version 1.0 to 2.0. i can map the columns of 1.0 to django model fields in 2.0 (or even the database itself if necessary).<p>i'm looking for a tool i can use to do this. basically, i give it a list of maps like "version1.mytable.foo" maps to "version2.mytable.bar", hit "run", and it will transfer the information from one database to another based on the maps.<p>extra points if it can do the reverse as well, in case something goes terribly wrong and we have to roll back to 1.0.<p>any ideas?	2008-07-26 19:57:42 UTC		2	3

8100034	ask hn: github journals?	does there exist some application or framework for writing journals that are related to some repository, for example hosted on github?<p>say you have a repository, for example on github (might as well just be git, svn, etc., for that matter). occasionally you might want to publish a journal entry, in which you write your thoughts about your current work and the current state on your repository. the journal itself is just a timestamp, the text that you&#x27;ve written in some format, and also a link to the current commit in your repository at the time of writing. this way, any future reader (including yourself) can easily see the context in which you were operating.<p>i&#x27;ve thought that this might be something that i would enjoy using, at least when the inspiration strikes or i have something that i feel i should document at a particular point in time. like for example describing the thought-process behind the design that went into the code in the last, say, 25 commits (the journal could also link to the beginning, 25 commits ago, as well as the most recent commit at the time of writing).<p>maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue at all and the best solution is the simplest: namely have a directory of journal-entries, wherein you commit journal-entries in discrete files (one for each timestamp).	2014-07-29 00:16:16 UTC		2	4

3095690	show hn: an animated google +1 jquery plugin	hey everyone,
i had the idea to make an animated google +1 that mimics the style of button seen on any google search page. i've stuck the source on github and would love to hear any feedback.<p>the benefits of the plugin are:<p>- the button is animated (the same animation can be seen on any google search page and currently not available)<p>- privacy! a user has to opt in (via hover) to enable the button<p>- the minified plugin is small (~2kb) and contains the default assets encoded in base64 to reduce http requests. this means that when a user visits a page with multiple +1 buttons on, all buttons will load immedieaty and removes the noticable lag / flicker of assets being loaded that is currently seen with the code from google.<p>check out the source on github: https://github.com/laurencedawson/jquery.googleplusone.js<p>a live demo can be viewed at: http://laurencedawson.github.com/jquery.googleplusone.js<p>thanks!	2011-10-10 20:34:57 UTC		3	1

3998917	are files ready to change?	some of david gelernter's oft quoted file ideas:<p>"modern computing is based on an analogy between computers and file cabinets that is fundamentally wrong and affects nearly every move we make. (we store "files" on disks, write "records," organize files into "folders" — file-cabinet language.) computers are fundamentally unlike file cabinets because they can take action."<p>"our standard policy on file names has far-reaching consequences: doesn't merely force us to make up names where no name is called for; also imposes strong limits on our handling of an important class of documents — ones that arrive from the outside world. a newly-arrived email message (for example) can't stand on its own as a separate document — can't show up alongside other files in searches, sit by itself on the desktop, be opened or printed independently; it has no name, so it must be buried on arrival inside some existing file (the mail file) that does have a name. the same holds for incoming photos and faxes, web bookmarks, scanned images..."<p>"you shouldn't have to put files in directories. the directories should reach out and take them. if a file belongs in six directories, all six should reach out and grab it automatically, simultaneously."<p>"a file should be allowed to have no name, one name or many names. many files should be allowed to share one name. a file should be allowed to be in no directory, one directory, or many directories. many files should be allowed to share one directory. of these eight possibilities, only three are legal and the other five are banned — for no good reason."<p>it begs the question if files and the core systems on which they are read/stored are ready to change?  and will it be a start-up that makes the leap, or a lonely computer scientist who has no stake in the market?<p>http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/gelernter/gelernter_index.html	2012-05-20 14:57:19 UTC		3	1

(the site lets you upload photos and other content, and lets you invite others to your group, so it's easier to check it out within your own user account rather than using a single generic test account.)<p>really interested to hear your input and advice.  the idea for the site grew out of our frustration with not being able to keep track of family information -- photos, birthdays, giftlists, announcements, etc. -- all in one place.  we also wanted to make that place so easy to use that even our non-tech-savvy family members can participate.<p>what do you think?  what's working for you, and what should we be doing better/differently in your opinion?	2008-05-27 03:44:16 UTC		3	4

1062410	ask hn: please review my webapp: sit4.us	hey everyone, i created a little webapp to make scheduling a babysitter easier and i'd love your input.<p>you can find it here: http://sit4.us<p>i got sick of calling around to a bunch of teenaged girls trying to find someone to babysit our kids so that i could take my wife out on friday nights.  i thought it would be much easier if i could just shoot an email out to all the people in our pool of babysitters and the first one to reply back that they can do it gets the job (and everyone else is notified that the gig has been taken).  so that's basically what this app does, it's just a way to manage requesting a babysitter from within your personal network of babysitters.<p>please let me know what you think, both about the site and about the idea in general.  i don't really care that much if it doesn't become the next big thing (which i'm sure it won't), because it's already making my life easier just in the last week that i've been using it.  even if i'm the only one who ever uses it it's totally worth the $9 domain registration and 2 or so days of work it took to throw it together using django.<p>thanks in advance!<p>mark	2010-01-19 16:15:39 UTC		5	8
230049	ask hn: carbon neutrality for a startup?	i've been seeing more and more companies becoming carbon neutral these days (dreamhost is a popular example, and rackspace offers a "green" server configuration as well as of this past january). after watching al gore's ted talk covering 15 ways of reducing your personal footprint, i started to look into companies selling carbon offsets.<p>my question for hacker news is, how would you assess the footprint of a startup so as to be "green from the get-go"?  what i can think of is:<p>- personal carbon use (house, transportation), since we don't have an office yet
- servers (our host isn't green to my knowledge)
- additional services such as amazon s3 and ec2<p>how would you go about calculating a carbon footprint for such a scenario?  also, do you think there is a real promotional advantage to being green?	2008-06-27 18:58:41 UTC		5	11
9529050	i love to programwhy do i hate programming classes?	i love to program.<p>to give some background, i am a high school student who is taking classes at my local community college. i made the decision to do this because i wanted to expand my programming knowledge. i develop games in my free time and programs when i find problems i can solve. i absolutely love this pass time and the creativity and satisfaction that comes from developing. i am thrilled when i run into a problem i don&#x27;t know how to solve because it just makes everything more interesting and i get to learn more about what ever language or engine i am using.<p>my issue now is the classes. i took a few classes at my community college and to be honest, they discouraged me. they were incredibly boring (granted they were a bit below my level, but i was still learning some new stuff!) and involved absolutely no creativity or exploration. it was the same thing every week: read this, code this, make sure syntax absolutely matches the syllabus, turn in. i don&#x27;t know why but this made me less excited for the future.<p>is this what it is like in the programming industry? i guess i am being a bit idealistic, but i thought that being on a team of people working on a project would be full of creativity and ideas being thrown around. i would be contributing to something a lot of people were passionate about. will i just be mundanely programming &quot;assignments&quot; from a boss and not having any emotional connection or excitement about the project i am working on?<p>to get back on topic, will programming courses get more interesting as i go on? i&#x27;m interested in topics such as 3d shaders and physics engines, but i&#x27;m afraid higher level programming classes connecting to these topics will be just as boring and uninspiring.<p>realistically, do programming courses get better&#x2f;more interesting?	2015-05-12 01:39:35 UTC		5	13
3887497	combining a phone and a tablet, anyone?	i would like to get some opinion from you guys....<p>i am a startup developing a new kind of mobile device that combines a phone and tablet - putting a 7" screen on a less than 5" phone body. (it is not like the galaxy note, where the size is fixed.)<p>so when you just want to make calls, check sms and emails, just use the "phone mode" with a 4"+ screen.
when you want to surf web, watch videos/photos, transform it into a 7"-screen tablet.
all of this in one single device, no detachable parts.<p>now my question is about the potential market for this device, as it seems that no company is creating a device like this, i am worried if there's no market for it.<p>a) for those of you carrying two devices (a phone and a tablet), are you feeling a bit inconvenient, annd would you like to have this device?<p>b) for those of you carrying only a phone, would you like to have a bigger screen, perhaps 7", while retaining the same portability?<p>c) would you still buy a 10" tablet after you have this device? (assuming you already have a laptop)<p>your help will be very much appreciated!	2012-04-25 03:08:00 UTC		5	16

1979880	advice on seeking a cto/co-founder/tech lead for a new fashion/style q&a site	hi, i’m a non-tech founder in new york city who needs help figuring out which route to take in my search for a cto/co-founder or lead developer with a strong ruby on rails background, and to some degree my product launch.<p>late last year i spent a lot of time trying to find someone to work with me on my idea and after coming up with few results i went the route of raising friends and family money to outsource development in order to build a prototype which could attract users, financing, and a technical lead/team. while the launch has been severely delayed due to a number of reasons, it’s slated to launch in stealth soon while we work out a couple kinks and then soon after we plan on doing a private beta and then finally a full fledged launch early next year after we’ve refined the product somewhat and built a bit of a user base.<p>i know i already have several things which need to be remedied with the site as soon as we get it out there, but many of the people from my original outsourced team are moving on to work on their own projects and i need to find someone as into the ideas i am, and if not, at least someone competent to work on helping me make changes to the site while i go through the search process for a tech lead.<p>any ideas, suggestions, recommendations for how to go about a search given my situation? i’ve already tapped into my network and can’t find anyone that can help.<p>also, please feel free to reach out for more details.<p>thanks a bunch and looking forward to hearing your advice!	2010-12-07 17:58:37 UTC		7	4

&#62;easy and fast to implement
&#62;simple html page + e-junkie
&#62;easy for users to buy and download<p>cons:
&#62;once it is downloaded it will be uploaded on all file sharing servers<p>membership website:
can use wp + membership plugin<p>pros:
&#62;membership content usually doesn't get copied
and uploaded on file sharing servers<p>cons:
&#62;implementation will take some time
&#62;users have to create a separate userid/pwd which seems to be a bit of work for them<p>plz share your 2cents, advice and experiences :)	2011-08-02 10:06:47 UTC		7	6

4825645	ask hn: open source, the future or not?	for a long time i’ve been asking myself this question. more and more startups are promoting themselves with open source and free to use services. lets take an example, a new service called www.supportduck.com. this is a startup that are promoting themself with open source approach where you can download the code for free on github, or you can use their web service for free. the startup above are moving into a market with a lot of great businesses already, well known businesses such as www.olark.com, www.zopim.com etc.<p>so that is why i'm asking, do you guys on hn think there is a future for businesses with an open source strategy where it is free for everyone.<p>i think that in the next couple of years, we will see a lot of startups with an open source strategy, but if they will keep running without any income i'm not sure.<p>kind regards

2370804	ask hn: are people satisfied with their website analytics?	there's a growing number of options out there for web analytics. google analytics being free still seems like the primary tool, but there's a few key areas it falls down. primarily you're stuck in a page view mentality, where if it isn't a page it doesn't matter in regards to goals and funnels.<p>there are some newer players in the space that try to fill some of the gaps of google analytics. clicky attempts to offer real time analytics so you have faster insight instead of the 2-3 hour delay that currently exists for most products. mixpanel allows you to get outside of pageview limitations, essentially giving you a blank slate to track anything, but then it starts to seem very broad as to how deep you have to go and whats effective.<p>having used several of the tools during bootstrapping, i'm still coming away unsatisfied with the insight that each were able to provide. am i entirely alone in my desire for a yet to be found, incredibly useful web analytics tool?	2011-03-25 23:35:14 UTC		8	2

2959076	ask hn: .net or not .net...	...that is the question. well, kinda.<p>i am a mid-20s programmer, in the uk. i've spent 5 years in the games industry and enjoyed it but didn't really settle. i've been neck-deep in c/c++ since uni and also done a fair amount of c# (desktop, not web). i also do a lot of python in my spare time and that includes some web programming. i consider myself to be a good 'all rounder' and that seems to be part of the problem.<p>being unable to settle at my last couple of jobs, i have been punting my cv about and i keep on getting the same feedback; it's not specific enough. as far as the recruiters are concerned, it seems like to get a job you need to commit to one language and framework combination. and lets be honest, 80% of jobs are .net/asp.net.<p>besides the fact that what i'd really like to do is find a start-up to join - birmingham start-up scene is meager - i guess the question is, is it worth my while getting to know asp.net in the hope that i'll find a decent, stimulating, well-paid job? or should i hold out for that dream role in a start up that might never come along?<p>thanks for any guidance anyone can give.	2011-09-04 08:37:24 UTC		9	3

2522298	ask hn: standing desks feedback and comments on your experience?	hi hnists!<p>as many of you here, i sit at my desk for extended periods of time so my thinking is that i would combine a daily session of standing and sitting in a good chair. for the chair, i was thinking of sticking with a steelcase leap. i saw this thread earlier today (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2518898).<p>i'm thinking about investing in an electronically height adjustable desk by steelcase. ve seen a lot of diy options too but (i think) i'd rather not mess around adjusting the height manually since i do have 2 monitors and a bunch of other stuff.<p>i'm curious to know about:
how long you can typically stand and do work? 
do you catch your shifting your weight to one side due to fatigue?
do you use and still use the standing desk religiously or did it turn into one of those fad ideas?<p>i'd appreciate any thoughts, comments and experiences.
thanks!!	2011-05-06 20:12:08 UTC		10	9

8510189	a new way to learn electronics	hackernews,<p>a little bit over a month ago, three guys started a new website project. our goal was to approach learning about electronics, and low level programming in the same way several other sites have already done with high level (web) programming.<p>at www.devfactor.net we have a small staff of volunteers trying to get everything up and running at full speed. our goal is to build a collection of beginner, intermediate and advanced tutorials centered around diy electronics, low level programming and the idea that you can make anything if you put your mind to it.<p>we are producing a monthly magazine newsletter (pdf&#x2f;html form), which covers some hot topics in our space. so far we have about ~100 subscribers into the ~10,000 visitors we should be seeing this month.<p>we&#x27;ve opted for an ad-free, user-oriented model. the only money generated by the site is amazon affiliate links right now, and every penny is going back into the website.<p>we really need some new authors though. we would like to be producing one high quality tutorial per day. if your someone who wants to get your name out there, and have a free space to talk about your hobby projects please contact us using the contact tab on the right. we are willing to discuss profit share with excellent contributors :)<p>anywho, we just wanted to share this with you because a ton of work has gone into it. three guys with day jobs are producing branding elements, migrating servers, implementing ssl, working on getting a cdn, mocking up tutorials, building projects, etc... really hope you can benefit from it :)<p>its an exciting time to be in smart electronics.<p>i hope you will check it out: www.devfactor.net<p>cheers,<p>the devfactor team	2014-10-26 03:47:28 UTC		13	0

8233328	ask hn: why is cloud storage so cheep?	today dropbox dropped prices. they now offer 1 tb for $10&#x2f;month. other providers like google drive have similar offers for quite some time.<p>i wonder how they do this. dropbox uses amazon s3 to save files. the lowest possible price on s3 is $0.0275&#x2f;gb&#x2f;month. if a dropbox user utilizes all available space it would cost dropbox $27.50&#x2f;month. in addition most users are not paying for dropbox but use there free offering adding files (=costs) to dropbox. running the company, development of the application, application server, download traffic etc. will come on top.<p>i see the following reasons why dropbox might be able to make profit in the end:<p>- most people are using much less space than the maximum of 1 tb.
- dropbox is doing deduplication. if two users have the same file dropbox only needs to save it once. 
- dropbox might have a better deal with amazon and is not paying $0.0275&#x2f;gb&#x2f;month.<p>do i overlook something? what is most important reason why dropbox and others are able to make this prices?	2014-08-27 17:17:35 UTC		14	12

5531269	software decoding of the 1541 disk drive gcr data in realtime	the code solves a real, practical problem that people have been struggling with for 30 years.<p>the 1541 contains a single 6502 cpu clocked at 1 mhz, 2 kb of ram and 16 kb of rom. with such modest specifications, commodore concluded that the 1541 was not capable of decoding the gcr data in realtime. commodore compatible 5.25" floppy disks store data as magnetic polarity reversals along 35 concentric tracks on the surface.  the key to the solution lies in looking at the problem from a novel angle. we'll use plenty of self-modifying code. this is not really a trick, but an established technique on the 6502 processor. the sax instruction is a mix of sta and stx; it tries to write the contents of both a and x to memory, and due to the nmos process used to manufacture the 6502, zeroes are stronger than ones, so bus contentions resolve into bitwise-and operations. thus, we can use sax to store a subset of the bits in a (or x) to memory without clobbering the rest of the register. furthermore, we can perform a bitwise-and operation using the sbx instruction (a mix of cpx and tax) with an operand of zero, which will leave the result in x.	2013-04-11 11:45:38 UTC	http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/gcr-decoding/index.php	37	1

1019398	ask hn: rate my startup idea "be caller nine"	i have always been fascinated with telephony programming (thanks, "war games") and radio call-in contests where you have to "be caller nine" in order to win a prize.<p>well, i have now developed a system that would allow any person/group/event/company/podcaster to run one of these call-in style contests just by administrating the incoming calls through a browser (instead of a giant 300 line switchboard like radio stations have). i have a working prototype, and the few people that have seen it thought it was a pretty neat idea.<p>my question is, would there be a market for this sort of thing? would people/groups be willing to pay to be able to run such a contest?<p>i imagine this being used for things like: live podcasts that have sponsorships; conferences; internet radio stations; college radio stations; school fundraiser events; ad-hoc internet events (think twitter chats); etc...<p>what do you think?	2009-12-28 21:23:51 UTC		48	28

7139188	looking for summer interns at turn	when it comes to cloud computing, the problem is scale. scale of request traffic, scale of storage demands, scale of big data transformations. these three determine the architecture of your system and decide whether your application is compatible with traditional databases or requires a custom-designed, partitioned, self-balancing, failure tolerant distributed system design.<p>at turn, although we are a small company, we are very familiar with the challenges of designing distributed systems for large traffic demands. most websites, from social networks to global email providers, have to deal with the traffic generated by their own users, at their own pace, browsing from page to page. however, in the online ad business, doing real-time bidding for ad impressions, we are part of a much larger share of traffic. we see the majority of bid requests for online ads generated globally and we have to respond to them within milliseconds. at peak times, our request rate is measured in millions of events per second. we store and synchronize our collected information globally within a fraction of a second. we process it using machine learning techniques to increase the accuracy of our bid decisions.<p>our runtime group, responsible for developing software for our real-time bid response systems, is looking for talented undergraduate and graduate students willing to join us for summer projects. you will be working on distributed data storage in high-throughput key-value stores and on global information replication with low-latency constraints. if java, paxos, consistent hashing, dynamo, kafka or spanner are familiar terms to you and if you are a great problem solver, we would love to hear from you! i am looking forward to receiving your resumes at vlad.balan@turn.com.	2014-01-28 19:38:31 UTC		1	0

3651748	ask hn: why don't the labels create a torrent tracker?	the labels currently generate not a single piece of value from file-sharing, it costs them a huge amount of resources to pursue their current strategy and as we all know, its not going amazingly for them.<p>when i say value i mean across the board: data, cash, ip.<p>lets assume for a second that the people who buy music buy music because thats their preferred method of acquisition (i am going to investigate this further) and the people who don't acquire media through the labels favourible methods (which in my opinion includes spotify etc) will simply never buy music then this puts then in an actually pretty good position.<p>i am suggesting that they do not promote this in anyway, they could even make it invite only in the early days to prove the model. i say this because i understand the risk of opening up this channel could lead to "hey, you still pay for music? don't be a chump, its not illegal anymore, you know the labels let you", or "ahh, whats this torrent thing? i'll do a quick google and maybe i'll find a real simple guide that helps me get setup".<p>what this does in my opinion is lets them do a massive land grab. lets face it, file sharers still appreciate high bitrates, new releases, exclusive content, they just don't want to pay for it. the labels go from zero to community, zero to masses of data on what people are consuming, current tastes and trends and as we all know data is big bucks. they also get the ip's, i'm not so hot on what they could potentially do with that but i know that data's worth something (bluekai, etc).<p>i think the exclusive content aspect of this is actually a nice bonus, file-shares now get value add. exclusive content gets shared. artists get discovered, loyalty grows.<p>but how are they going to make the money? good point. i think that the albeit light strategy above allows some time to sit on this decision for a while, test out a few things (after all, its already a major victory) - well:<p>dont charge at all = 
be happy that some guy in new zealand isn't getting rich off your content, its your data now, its your community.<p>charge models = 
i think any charge model depends on the cost being pretty nominal, $1/£1 lifetime type thing.<p>* pay based on what genre's you want to access ($1 a pop)
* buy an invite into the whole service ($1)<p>i hope this whole submission doesn't live or die based on the revenue models, i just threw that out there. i think personally, if i was the chief in charge and less the politics of it all i don't think i would charge. i would assume my initial assumptions were correct and that we've lost nothing, and gained everything (data, tastes). i'd be interested to know what suggestions were around monetizing something like that.<p>in addition, i guess a final thought on monetization was that if you delivered this tracker through the web - you could very well have lots of video content, lots of ticket/kickback related items and <i>gasp</i> banners. there's a lot of people listening to music, lots of people watching videos'.<p>i'd say it sure as hell beats their current model. lets the labels stop being a middle man, and gives them a distribution channel that they command, and they rule the roost for.	2012-03-01 11:46:07 UTC		1	0

5635957	ask hn: advice on creating a student tracking app?	at a nearby school, students are signed in as they arrive at after school care (time-stamp recorded), and signed out when their parent or other adult picks them up (time-stamp again). the adult also signs their signature at pick-up. there are close to 500 students and about 75-100 attend after-school activities.<p>currently the time-stamps and signatures are done on paper (!!!), and i have been asked to see about implementing a digital solution (free). the person in charge has an android tablet (htc evo view 4g) and there is wifi available. the app or website should allow storing of multiple adults who can pick up a student (parents, siblings, etc), searching by name of either the student or the responsible adult's name, recoding timestamps and signatures, and be able to do some billing calculations or exporting to a spreadsheet.<p>how would you implement this? what language(s), technologies, and hosting platforms would you use?<p>here is a little about me (though feel free to describe what you think would be the optimal solution): i have some fairly basic android skills (you can see my app via my profile), so i am thinking a web application would be best. i know html/css/js and a tiny, tiny bit of ruby/rails. i also found a few jquery signature libraries, which look very promising:<p>http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad

5388347	ask hn: which free rss reader to recommend to our inexperienced users... on ie?	i run www.searchtempest.com, a niche search engine for classifieds sites like craigslist (no affiliation).  one of our features is to provide an opml file of the craigslist rss results feeds for the user's search from all cities within a specified range.<p>this can be extremely convenient for people looking for a rare item and willing to travel to get it when it comes up.  you can stick it into a folder in your rss reader, and have your own personalized feed of new results matching your search.  however, our user base is representative of the general population.  in other words, many of them do not yet use rss.  some are quite technically savvy, but many are not, and many use ie.<p>thus far, we have been recommending google reader to those unfamiliar with rss, for obvious reasons.  we've written detailed step-by-step instructions[1] for importing and organizing the feeds in gr.<p>as you <i>may</i> have heard, google reader will be discontinued soon.  so we need an alternative.  i would love to recommend newsblur, but the fact is that most of our users won't be willing to explore a paid service, and in almost all cases, the free limit of 10 sites will be exceeded.  (personally i think newsblur is worth its price many times over, but that's irrelevant.)  i would also recommend feedly in an instant, except... ie.  tried theoldreader, but found filtering and sorting large numbers of feeds into folders to be quite a pain.  also slow, although that may well be temporary.<p>so... what do we recommend?  above all, it needs to be simple.  if it's a great reader in general, all the better, but the main criterion is that we can get someone from zero to viewing their craigslist results in as few simple steps as possible.  and it needs to be free, and needs to work in ie.<p>[1] http://tinyurl.com/atrdqyt	2013-03-17 06:15:38 UTC		1	4

7626213	ask hn: do you agree on these screening shortcuts when hiring tech developers?	i came across this interesting video (youtube.com&#x2f;watch?v=sk27tqxv4ko&amp;t=26m49s),
where some screening tips are mentioned (imgur.com&#x2f;bpijk9w).<p>one of them says that a good developer always uses either os x or linux and using windows is a no-no. another one says the preferable primary scripting language should be ruby or python.<p>what do you think about these so called hiring heuristics?
will ditching a windows laptop for a macbook and being proficient in either ruby or python give you a career boost in the long run?	2014-04-22 07:05:40 UTC		1	11

5680714	cloud academy is hiring a "creator of cloud awesomeness"	some others might call this "community manager", "content creator" and the like, but we like the other title much more!<p>are you one of these people that always engages with others? are you passionate about cloud computing, and technology? are you able to create compelling content (videos, presentations, how-tos and the like) that would drive people crazy about you? do you like being mentored, but at the same time have a great level of independence in your decisions?
this is the role for you!
instead of the usual, boring list of requirements, we just want to see if you have the mojo for this. create a 5 minutes video, with your voice over, in which you explain one of the following platforms:<p>a) amazon web services
b) microsoft azure
c) google compute engine
d) rackspace cloud<p>we will evaluate your video and if we love it, we will contact you for additional interviews. good points will be assigned for good pronunciation, high quality, engagement. this video represents half of your hiring process: you better nail it right!<p>at cloud academy, we like to trust our employees. you can work from home as much as you please, as long as you stay in touch with your team. you can pick any software, os or technology that will do the job, as long as we love the results.
to apply, send an email to an anonymous address, like jobs@... no, let's do it better: email our ceo, stefano bellasio, at stefano@cloudacademy.com.<p>if we decide to hire you, we will contract you for three months; if we love you even more after this initial period, we will hire you full time.
salary for the first three months will be 6,300 us$. salary for the full-time position depends on how great you are.<p>at the moment, we strongly prefer to hire someone living in the european union or united states and with work permit to work there. if you live elsewhere we might still consider you if your video is pure awesomeness. surprise us!	2013-05-09 14:54:13 UTC		1	-1

981274	ask hn: is a proxy service best way to test your website from other locales?	hi,<p>i have a website i that i want to test from other locations e.g. usa, asia, middle east, to see how it performs, ensure that locale and other information is correct, and test some international payments through the system.<p>i was wondering what is the best to do this?<p>i was thinking of using some proxy services (ideally supporting https) to do this e.g. such as those used by online gamers to play in/from different regions, but am not sure if they are trustworthy i.e. firstly they constantly seem to be coming and going and secondly many of them seem to be blacklisted by popular services (e.g. if you try to visit amazon/ebay using them you get blocked) and hence i worry if i use them my payment gateway (yet to be finalised, i am assessing several) may regard it as bad activity and i don't want to tarnish any account with them.<p>thoughts and suggestions appreciated. thanks.	2009-12-07 15:12:38 UTC		2	0

generally, is it legal to access/use information found on a used storage device that you have purchased?<p>specifically, suppose company a is a competitor of company b. company b goes out of business and has an auction to sell off its assets. company a purchases used network attached storage devices from auction. the nas is not reformatted, and contains various data from company b. what information, if any, is legally fair game for company a to access, and or use?<p>i would assume information regarding account info like account numbers, login credentials, etc would not be legal to use (ie it would be fraudulent). but what about information like product information (sku / product interchange relations), pricing matrices, etc.<p>perhaps none of it is legally fair game? i don't know. please provide input regarding this hypothetical situation.	2010-11-29 18:37:54 UTC		2	1

2501504	releasing startup soon -- constructive criticisms needed for "buzz" page	hn,<p><pre><code>  i know all you guys have a short time so i’ll try to be as quick as possible.  a friend and i are going to release our startup in about two months that will be a social approach to rating, buying, sharing and collecting coffee.
</code></pre>
37signals “getting real” is a book i hold close and dear and they recommend to get out a “buzz” page to collect contacts.  so i built a simple one with a few features:<p>- linked up to fb instead of asking for emails for social proofing and its a lot easier to “like” something than give up your email address.<p>- showed my friends screenshots to get quotes, linked to their twitter accounts to give credibility<p>- since its not released it hasn’t been featured in any outlets, i did however submit it to some of the leading “link dumps” and put their logos in there.  even though being seen on digg isnt a big deal, the logos add credibility<p>- offered incentives that will be followed up on: early adopter badges and early invites.<p>what i’d like from you guys:
1. like it if you like coffee.  i’d be smitten.<p>2. what would you do to make a more efficient and effective buzz page to collect user bases?  what pearls of wisdom do you have to market and grow a new web app/startup?<p>3. if you are a coffee drinker, how do you think technology can be used to make your coffee experience better?  what would you really like to see in future iterations of a coffee application?

8309532	ask hn: dev in data warehousing – how to change career?	hello, i am a dev in microsoft. i have been in ms for about 10 years now. i have broad experience in data warehousing, databases, web applications, windows service applications etc. but, i am primarily a data warehousing guy. i have deep knowledge on etl processes, data modelling, and data related skills.<p>tech-wise, i am good at sql server, c#, asp.net, informatica, etc. mostly ms technologies.<p>on the family side i am married with 2 children. we are a single income family. i get a good base pay with excellent benefits at microsoft. i am thankful to ms for what they have provided to me.<p>below is the my current job situation.<p>1. i am starting to learn machine learning (andrew ng&#x27;s ml course), python and hadoop and getting excited about it. i feel that machine learning&#x2f;data mining fits well for my career progression given my data warehousing skills.
2. my current job requirements does not need machine learning.
3. microsoft does not use hadoop, python, etc. no offence on ms, but the skills are not completely externally transferable.
4. i am not focussing on my job and starting to feel worried about it.<p>i am wondering if i should start looking outside microsoft. i am although worried, about the following and looking for advice:
1. how difficult is to land a position in machine learning given my lack of experience in that area? i don&#x27;t want to regret later, that i quit a stable job in microsoft only to end up something other than machine learning.
2. what companies are out there, where i can get a reasonable pay, and get to do machine learning stuff?
3. what are the sites and avenues to apply for ml jobs? i know linkedin, stackoverflow, indeed.com, or else basically go to each company&#x27;s site to apply.
4. can you recommend head hunters that can place me on ml jobs?
5. are there any career counsellors that can help?<p>your frank advice is appreciated.	2014-09-12 18:21:40 UTC		4	1

1679769	ask hn: would an apprenticeship prepare you better than college?	in the old days, professions were taught through apprenticeships.  a carpenter would teach a young person the craft in exchange for the labor of the person for a mutually agreed upon period of time.  and completing this arrangement would give potential customers some assurance of competence.<p>would this work for software development and how do you think it would compare versus the college experience?	2010-09-10 18:40:45 UTC		4	3
985092	ask hn: lala land grab?	i just had a thought. apple bought lala, and i've spent probably about $50-$100 on lala for music. this is a pretty big music library since albums are so cheap. i've gotten in the flow of listening to lala every day and i'm always adding more music. i love it.<p>now, the speculation is that apple is going to turn lala into a streaming itunes product. knowing apple's itunes price points, i'm <i>very</i> skeptical that they will keep the prices where they are on lala. with the inevitable iphone app, apple is surely going to position the itunes streaming service as just as good, if not better than buying the music as it is now. to see them then offer a 10x price cut over buying the track in full would just cannibalize the itunes store.<p>it seems clear apple will be stuck grandfathering in everyone's lala collection, otherwise they'll alienate all current lala users from itunes (myself included.) nevermind the horrible press they'd get if suddenly hundreds of thousands of dollars of music is ripped from the hands of lala users. but, they are going to almost certainly have higher prices for future purchases than lala has now.<p>my conclusion: it might be time to buy as much cheap lala music as you can until they can launch the itunes streaming service. worst case, you're out $100 or whatever you want to blow. (if its any consolation, if you lose this money because apple screws everyone over, apple will probably go down with you!) best case, you end up with a nice music library you can listen to anywhere that will go up in value tenfold in a few weeks.<p>also, if you haven't uploaded your music collection to lala, you should probably do it now. i'd be shocked if apple grandfathers in uploaded tracks too, but who knows!	2009-12-09 01:47:04 UTC		4	4

4734276	ask hn: how do i recruit another programmer for my game?	i've been moonlighting the development of a multiplayer ios game for about 8 months and i find myself in a dilemma. i'm currently working as part of a 2 person team that consists of myself (the main programmer) and an artist. we've fleshed out a lot of the artwork and core mechanics, and you can even play a complete multiplayer game locally. while not public, the game has received very positive feedback from the communities we have shared it with. the problem is that this game was destined to be played with friends over the internet.<p>i know what i need, a programmer familiar with restful web services, aws, client/server architecture and network libraries. getting connected with the right developer has proved to be very challenging however. we even hired a contractor at one point, but were left with less than satisfactory results. we’re hoping to find someone that can eventually be as excited about this project as we are. we’d love to share our enthusiasm and get this game published. i’ve tried a lot of different approaches, but i’m at a loss for where i should look? we’re somewhere between a startup and a serious side project so we’re pretty flexible with the exact business arrangement. any ideas?	2012-11-02 19:18:44 UTC		6	6

(and after c it feels like i'm cheating, lol.)<p>what's going to be a lot more intense and teach me the type of data structures that i need to learn in order to produce web applications?<p>is there an online resource that goes through your first big app like lpthw does with basics?	2011-11-04 21:56:41 UTC		6	6

1059211	ask hn: is google's go ready for serious projects?	i've spent the last few weeks re-learning c to write a simple server for my startup. the last time i wrote any c, i was in college and had only just finished "learning to program with pascal". re-approaching it as a more experienced programmer—and one used to newer, more dynamic languages, at that—i've found it pretty frustrating.<p>c has frustrated me not because more lines are required to get things done, or because malloc'd memory must be freed. (i understand what kind of language c is and what it is designed to do). i'm frustrated by the inherent problems of macros and the constraining nature of static typing. i think my frustrations are best summed up by this thought experiment: imagine the only pre-processor directive was #include; with no #define or #if etc. what would c be like?<p>my take has been that a lot of what makes c so simple, and effective at achieving it's noble but relatively humble goals, also causes it to be greatly constraining. i think this is why the c pre-processor was introduced. the pre-processor attempts to tackle problems of excessive constraint. it sort of solves them (kinda), but also introduces a whole load of new ones.<p>in my most recent attempt, i'm using a couple of macros to generate readers and writers (of files) of a bunch of number types that my server uses. i'm pretty pleased with the results, but feel like i just pulled a big hack. (i can already picture the hardass purists on ##c telling me off for doing it). and i noticed what i was doing reminded me of haskell typeclasses.<p>another problem for me—a controversial problem, seeing as you have these in c++ and objective-c as well—is header files. i really hate having to write those. i hate having to wrap them in #ifndefs and the decisions of where other header #includes should go. i can't help thinking "why can't these be generated? or inferred? and why do i have to write /almost/ the same thing again?".<p>in response to all this, i decided to watch that hour-long talk on go again. i had good intentions; i was looking for ideas to better my c programming. but instead, perhaps unsurprisingly, it showed me more places where c was less-than-great; the shortcomings of the c const keyword were mentioned, as was the silliness of typed constants. that talk increased my frustration with c, and now i'm considering using go to write my server.<p>what does using go mean for me? i'll be able to use channels (whatever they are) and concurrency will be a lot easier (a problem i had chosen to—<i>cough</i>—defer, whilst i was working with c). it also looks like that typeclass-thing i was using macros for is formally emboddied by go's "interfaces". this all sounds great but there's a concern: go is a very new language. in a brief session on #go-nuts, i exchanged with someone trying out go's regular expressions. we concluded that there was quite a glaring bug in the regular expression parser, which is slightly alarming although perhaps not surprising.<p>so, you're about up to date now, and i ask: has anyone on hn tried go? what do you think? is it too new or buggy for a serious project? i am a lone developer and i'm prepared to be experimental, but it's important that this server be reliable.<p>(i have already considered erlang for this project but decided it wouldn't give me the low-level control i wanted, and dismissed haskell for the same reason; i'm steering clear of c++ for all the reasons previously discussed on hn; objective-c seems to compete more directly with go but it's still a superset of c, so i imagine it suffers from similar problems).<p>thanks for reading.	2010-01-18 01:04:52 UTC		7	8
2074256	ask hn: would you pay for this app?	i have an idea for an app and would like feedback as to whether you would want it and how much you would pay. i basically want to make something like dropbox where you can store your files online and they are automatically synced, but instead of storing your files on a third party's servers, store them on your own computers. you would set up the app on all the computers you want to save your files to and then you'd have a raid-like setup where if one computer (or maybe more) is destroyed, the rest would have backups of the file. it'd work a lot like bit torrent.<p>would you pay for something like this? how much?	2011-01-06 06:02:06 UTC		7	10

1510069	ask hn: how should i go about finding an interesting job	hello hn, i have been a long time user on hn and really respect this community; nowhere have i found so many bright people who are willing to offer genuine feedback and/or advice. and here i am asking for one.<p>i've reached to a point where i am finding it increasingly difficult to find a real development job in canada (i live in the us but will be moving). it almost appears that there's a great devoid of opportunities for a good developer.<p>i have been following all the popular job feeds (indeed, workopolis, craigslist,  top 100 employer etc.) for last several  months and yet, i haven't found a compelling job and/or company which values developers as an asset.<p>i have been approached by a few companies, but they will filter me on my  (easily fake-able) skill matrix or by code spit on phone. may be it is because of my background (java), or may be it is just me (slightly above average developer :) ). or my be my resume has never reached to human.<p>sometimes i think i should rather drop the idea of working for someone and  start something of my own, but i have tried and failed in the stage of ramen-profitability so many times that i don't have strength to really pull this off with dependent family anymore. as frustrating as this sounds, i really seek the direction where i can feed the family and still work on an interesting job.<p>how would you go about finding job you want in canada? what am i missing?	2010-07-13 01:27:51 UTC		10	11
4268869	how can i get out of a mountain of grad school debt?	i’ve dug myself into a hole and i’m wondering what advice people could give me on how to get out of it.<p>as a kid i dreamed of being a star entrepreneur, after reading the countless stories out there.  as i grew up i held that dream tightly, deciding to first go to engineering school (a tiny school), where i got my bachelors and masters degrees.<p>i was hired right out as a product manager at a software company and i did that for four years, hoping to learn how products get made and sold.<p>after a few years i wanted to learn more about business, and was encouraged by those around me to go to business school for an mba.<p>i did that, without thinking hard enough about the debt that i would be taking on or for that matter the debt i had already.  i went to an alright school (top 100), i had a low gmat (entrance exam) score and i graduated with average grades (3.44/4.00 gpa).  i did not do an internship, due to an illness.<p>i then got married, and took on my wife’s debt (she got a master’s degree in writing and makes barely anything as a professional writer).  added to that i came down with a psychiatric illness; this cut into the mba career prep, and kept me from making strong interpersonal connections.  while i’m fine now, i had to use credit cards to stay afloat and pay the bills for a while.<p>all told, i’m $400k in debt and living with the in-laws.  if i made a $100,000 salary at a “high paying” job it would just get me by.  right now i have a year’s supply of cash (on a ramen budget), a place to stay and no kids.  i have a lot of free time as i’m still unemployed.<p>part of me wants to use this desperation right now to try and start a project, develop a product and try to make a fortune off it.<p>the more logical part of me wants to find a ridiculously high paying job (well over $100,000), although my experience so far has given me significant doubts anything like that exists for someone who has been out of the workforce for coming up on four years and was not a stellar mba student.<p>so i’m asking for some advice for going forward (i’m well aware i didn’t make the right choices in the past and that i didn’t have the best luck).<p>pg says the best way to get rich is to do a startup.  but he doesn’t say what the best way to get rich is for people with a heavy debt load (if there is a way).<p>i want to get rid of this debt asap and i’m wondering what out-of-the box ways people can think of (if there are any).<p>thanks in advance for your comments.	2012-07-20 01:04:57 UTC		10	21

4856272	brainstorm with hn: let's fix ridiculously expensive education	(i'm not sure whether this 'brainstorm with hn' will work as a good format for discussion within the hn community, but i think it fits the subject here.)<p>hi hn,<p>i've been thinking about the problems with education, and what we (hackers, entrepreneurs, you name it) can do about it. i'm going to focus on education on the university level, mainly because that's what people are talking so much about nowadays.<p>what i think is that at the university level, it's not so much the actual learning that we have to improve: it's grading. people can learn by themselves (many have been doing just that for a long time), and while there's certainly room for improvement, this isn't the part about universities i think needs replacing. grading, or getting a degree, on the other hand, is a much more significant problem: employers want to know that you've learned something; when going through a thousand cvs, they don't want to have to extensively test every potential employee to see whether they really know what they claim to know. thus, degrees.<p>of course, there have been some great improvements here. coursera, for example, have made the big university courses more accessible for all. but i don't doubt better things are yet to come, so let's discuss those: what do you think is the largest thing that needs serious improvement in education? what, if anything, do you miss from these projects such as coursera? what are your ideas to make (online) education even better?<p>discuss. :)	2012-12-01 00:33:52 UTC		12	13

i just launched a web app called onesmallpage which aims to help you read more by emailing you a page (or more) of a book of a book every day. i'd like to hear your feedback on the design and functionality of the site. also any feature requests, or discussions about the future of the site would be more than welcome.<p>http://onesmallpage.appspot.com<p>basically the site came out of the idea that i do a lot of reading every day, but most of it isn't reading great books. i read my email, facebook, twitter, and a host of other websites every day and i thought that if i could channel at least a little bit of that reading into book reading i would be a more productive and well-rounded person.<p>right now i'm pulling about 100 out-of-copyright books from project gutenberg for you to choose from. if the site gets popular i plan to add the entire catalog.<p>the way it works is you find a book that you want to read, enter your email, and we will send you up to 5 pages of that book a day.<p>thanks for any feedback!

503334	ask hn: how do you cope with incompetent team members?	i am working on a not-so-small project in a team of 10 people. we like us all, we are all friends and like working together, but i have a problem with one of them. he likes his job, and he tries to do his best, but he just doesn't seem to get the 10000ft view of things, and loses himself in unimportant stuff, so other team members sometimes have to do his work for him, or help him out on all kinds of stuff, not allowing them to get on with their work (which they are best at).
how do you handle these situations? should i alienate him and get him out of the group, looking for someone else to do his job? or should i try to explain the situation to him? what do you think?	2009-03-04 20:00:01 UTC		26	25

2929612	iphone vs android app sales: numbers from an indie developer	hey hn,<p>i've been a full time indie iphone developer for about 9 months. i've recently ported my 2nd highest selling iphone app to android. here is a comparison for the first 2 weeks of sales. if other ios developers are out there that are thinking of porting to android, i hope this may be of help.<p>to keep things fair i'm only comparing one version of my paid iphone app to its android equivalent (fantasy football monster '11). this does not include any ad revenue, in app purchases or ipad sales.<p>date         android  iphone<p>aug 25, 2011 $177.67  $420<p>aug 24, 2011 $261.30  $382<p>aug 23, 2011 $386.68  $386<p>aug 22, 2011 $447.26  $425<p>aug 21, 2011 $422.18  $585<p>aug 20, 2011 $280.06  $403<p>aug 19, 2011 $211.09  $352<p>aug 18, 2011 $194.37  $388<p>aug 17, 2011 $357.39  $342<p>aug 16, 2011 $463.99  $330<p>aug 15, 2011 $384.55  $407<p>aug 14, 2011 $376.20  $483<p>aug 13, 2011 $263.34  $502<p>aug 12, 2011 $209.00  $508<p>total            $4428.08 $5914<p>per day          $316.29  $422.43<p>so, overall the android version of my app makes about 75% of its iphone equivalent. this is significantly better than i expected.<p>one more data point. the android app is currently about 250ish overall top paid, and the iphone version is 350ish. take from that what you will.<p>some quick observations about android from an ios developer's perspective:<p>1) i think developing <i>quality</i> apps is easier on ios. i'm actually a java/.net developer by profession so i should naturally be biased toward android. but once you get past the initial learning curve, i think that cocoa touch apis get you 90% of the way there, whereas android apis get you about 30% of the way there. that is to say, if you want a lot of the nice ui touches you're used to on the iphone, you'll have to spend much more effort getting there on android. the main advantage i feel android has is memory management, but the reference counting method that objective-c uses is second nature once you are familiar with the fundamentals.<p>2) android gives you real time sales analysis. this is pretty incredible. yes you can somewhat simulate this on iphone using 3rd party analytics, but being able to see the moment someone bought your app just brings my obsession with checking sales and stats to another level. you also get your daily reports much sooner (about 12:30am pst as opposed to 5-6am pst).<p>3) android market screws up orders quite a bit. in fact, almost 20% of all orders are declined or cancelled due to some android market error. after checking forums, it seems like this is not unusual. now, i don't know if this means i have 20% lost sales, but still disturbing nonetheless. in android's defense, apple actually never gives you this level of detail. to my knowledge, you don't know if users can't buy your app due to an app store error. but judging from the fact that we get e-mails about this issue every other day on android and i've never gotten a single e-mail about this in the past 15 months i've been on the app store is very telling. google has got to fix this. developers lose, customers lose, and google loses.<p>in conclusion, i feel like the android market has really come into its own. the common wisdom that android owners do not pay for apps is demonstrably false. they may not pay as much per user for apps as iphone owners, but the enormous marketshare android commands is just too much to ignore.<p>i'll try to address any questions or comments in a timely manner, but i'm currently in europe so please forgive me i don't get to all of them. thanks for reading.	2011-08-26 19:18:27 UTC		292	91

160398	so, what's the next step?  let's network.	some people reading this are kicking themselves for not having applied to for yc.  some people reading this got rejected yesterday.  some people reading will be rejected in a couple weeks.  and all of us have a lot of rejection on the horizon or under our belts.<p>get used to it.  let's hack the system.<p>two of the main things that yc provides are connections and other smart people to bounce your ideas off of.  let's build that.<p>i've set up a few things to further that today:<p>- a hacker news linkedin group.  you can connect by going to my profile and connecting from there.  i've not found a reliable way to send a link other than that.  add a line to your "groups and associations" with your news.yc nick.  i'll add everyone in with over 20 karma -- just enough to establish active community members.  (if you get rejected, it's because either because the info isn't there, or your profile isn't public.  just add it and re-request.)<p>http://www.linkedin.com/pub/7/8a8/6a3<p>- a mailing list for entrepreneurs.  the contents will remain private (though i'd still use some caution when posting your secret sauce).  this isn't for general news.  you can bounce business ideas off of others, ask for help in establishing connections and look for partners, co-founders, etc. there.  if you can, subscribe with an address from your startup.  if not, i'll send you a follow-up mail to figure out what you're hacking on.  this one is for people that are already working on a startup, not just passively interested.  we'll be incorporating soon, and we'll consider swapping minor stakes (1% or so) with another startup or three where we see there could be a mutually reinforcing relationship and where we value your input.  if others consider the same that might be a cool way to pull the community together a bit.<p>http://lists.directededge.com/listinfo.cgi/startups-directededge.com<p>- i'm in the process of setting up a small web-app where we can store extended hacker-news profile information with stuff we know about (i.e. "connections to angel funding", "friends that are driver developers", "ajax") and stuff we're looking for other people that know about, and an index of those.  this should allow for some info swapping and ideally will suck less than linkedin for such things.  paul, if you're reading and would consider that as a patch to the news.yc source, i'd be fine dusting off my lisp chops and doing it that way, otherwise it can live on our servers.  once it's up i'll post source code for anyone that wants to extend it and work with us.  i'll mail the list and possibly repost here when it's ready.<p>now, let's get back to kicking ass.	2008-04-10 22:13:02 UTC		56	38

921592	ask hn: the road to learning useful math	<i>background</i>: i've got a fairly good intuition for logic and algorithms as a coder, but no formal training in the maths side of things. i last did math in high-school (a-level here in the uk at 18) and while i remember some calculus, pure maths, probability etc., i've never really touched advanced stuff. i didn't take any maths modules at university either.<p>i've recently come across quite a few interesting stats-heavy compsci papers where the mathematical notations and concepts expressed escape me. i'd like to correct this -- and i've seen a few comments floating around here that this stuff isn't actually that hard, and this has got me thinking.<p>could hn recommend any 'math for programmers' resources or suggest structured approaches (ie. 'look into x, then y, then try understanding z) to go about learning this sort of stuff? i think i'm probably not alone here in wanting to learn more about this sort of thing.<p>a quick google provides some interesting links to get started:<p>math for programmers: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html<p>'concrete mathematics' by graham, knuth &#38; patashnik:

2253876	ask hn: what lifestyle business could i help to create for my mom?	my mom is a travel agent working in a physical travel agency. needless to say their business isn't going well, and she'll have to look for another job, which can be hard for a 50+ woman.<p>so my goal right now is to help her create some kind of a lifestyle business where she could work from home.<p>right now i could only think of helping her to set up some kind of blog/e-magazine about travels and hopefully make money from hotel lead generation / affiliation. though that would require to have some critical mass. i also thought about ebay, but i don't have any experience on the seller side so it's hard to see what's possible.<p>any hner set up a business lifestyle for his mom before ?<p>any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks !	2011-02-23 12:45:40 UTC		78	50

2777883	ask hn: where is the django community?	i'm debating whether to pick up ruby on rails in addition to my basic django knowledge, and as i explore the ror community, i can't help but be amazed at how rich and active it is. for learning rails there are 3 very high quality books that talk about the latest version (rails way, rails tutorial, agile web development with rails). compare this to the books available django, none of which discuss the latest edition and many of which are outdated(e.g. django book v2 (the latest ed.) covers django 1.0!).<p>this doesn't touch on the huge number of blogs/sites that are dedicated to ruby news and tips (e.g. planetrubyonrails, railscasts, etc.).<p>is there a reason for this discrepancy between the two ecosystems? am i just not aware of where the django community lives? also, for those of you using django or rails, did the size of the community for your framework of choice influence your decision?	2011-07-18 19:45:30 UTC		147	155

1. uiuc ece phd, currently at big name place in the silicon valley.
2. u-minn cs, currently also at big name place in the silicon valley.
3. we are pursuing this because we believe we can build a better product than what is currently out there.
4. we are not doing this to be cool. we are cool enough already.<p>it would be easier for us to work with someone in the valley but we can try to work around that for an exceptional candidate.<p>you can reach me at: hitatscale@gmail.com<p>if you have a pointer to any of your previous work/portfolio, that would be appreciated.<p>thank you very much...	2013-05-15 05:53:39 UTC		1	0

4153218	ask hn: should i specialize?	hi hackers,
 i have been programming a long time and i enjoy it alot. i don't get much free time these days and my job requires me to be a bit of a generalist across the .net stack, asp.net/sql server wcf,rest,and javascript. with the lack of free time and work time being spent more recently on solving mundane business issues in a chaotic unorganised environment with not much good team work or good management for that matter.
 (i've already designed the application framework, delivered it, supported it a while, tried to spread the knowledge among the permanent staff.)<p>i am feeling like i am ready for a change of career at the moment and i am debating with myself about taking some well earned timeout to do some intensive educ-macat-ing and studying up in a specialist area of technology and maybe perhaps getting involved in some open source work, building relationships in the tech community and perhaps building a product or two to help with my learning. i need to decide what to specialize in, i have many interests that i would like to pursue ( .net mobile, bi, javascript frameworks, sql server, functional programming,node, nosql, music ), but i think i need to focus
in one area, perhaps becoming more expert in an area of the microsoft stack or maybe throwing a curve ball and going for something completely leftfield.<p>i obviously have to keep a roof over my head and keep everyone fed and clothed, so i reckon i can afford perhaps 6 months to a year out of my security and just see where it takes me.<p>all suggestions most welcome!<p>thanks.

220931	ask hn: how to update a large network of computers	i am working for a company that has several thousand stores located in a large geographic area. every time data changes have to be delivered to the stores (around 500mb each) there are about a dozen servers transferring the info to each individual store. as you probably imagine it takes a long time to do it and it requires a lot of bandwidth. it will be faster if the stores could be updated from other stores, specially if they are close from each other. do you know of any software that can help us do it. may be some type of mirroring or maybe git or some other version control system work for it. any suggestions?	2008-06-18 17:36:48 UTC		1	9
183093	ask yc: i have a twitter account with 1800+ followers, what do you think it is worth?	i'm just curious what the account may be worth.  i've actually had the account less than a week and it has grown quickly.  i remember there was some guy who was trying to sell his twitter account on ebay and the bidding was up to $1500+ (for 1500 followers) before he canceled it.  i know it kind of depends on what the account name is, etc... but i'd prefer to remain anonymous right now and i am mostly interested in a generic $ value/follower figure.  any best guesses?

4229448	macros for html---good or bad?	i've been looking at both less.js and more.js with the idea of adding constants/definitions to my css code. while doing so it occured to me that, that wasn't what i actually needed. what i need is to be able to give arbitrary unicode meaningful names no matter where i use them. as a for instance, &#38;#9812; is the hex version of 'black chess king'. clearly the official 'name' isn't particularly easy to use, but it is quite descriptive. what i'd prefer, is something more along the lines of &#38;mdash;, say &#38;bking; but at a guess the w3c folk play bridge (hence &#38;club;, &#38;spade; etc.) and not chess. this suggests to me that a macro processor would be a solution. having said that, i'm also aware of how such things are abused (see: 'c' and 'c++') and wonder what those who actually code in html or adjunct material would feel about such a thing?	2012-07-11 14:52:42 UTC		2	0

3512006	my kill hollywood idea: actors/directors become startups	i don't have much more to add than what's in the title but i'm thinking along the lines of the way spacey and fincher are working with netflix but turned up to 11. so the idea is something like... build a startup with brad pitt, in essence he is the startup... he agrees to not work with hollywood anymore in exchange for funding and artistic freedom. as soon as you have 5-10 top stars working this way it's a snowball rolling downhill. in my imagination there are hundreds of things standing in the way of this being reality but there's no time like the present to start destroying them.	2012-01-25 22:22:28 UTC		2	0

7346904	ask hn: locking android tablets - how fool proof is it?	i am the it manager for a large retailer. we are thinking of purchasing hundreds of android tablets for our workforce instead of low end laptops, what we used to buy traditionally. the primary use for these devices would be to capture data related to budgeting and purchase orders and using our erp tools.<p>as we do not want the staff to use the provided tablets for playing games and facebook and watching videos etc, we want to install applock (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;play.google.com&#x2f;store&#x2f;apps&#x2f;details?id=com.domobile.applock) or something similar.<p>my question is .. is it possible to overcome the applock&#x27;s lock by fiddling with the filesystem of the device by connecting it to a pc&#x2f;mac - other than by factory resetting the device (which will erase our in-hour erp apps anyway).	2014-03-05 13:57:37 UTC		2	1

5387589	is this a good idea for sorting your photos?	know how podcast episode 35 has some good tips on organizing your photo collection. http://twit.tv/show/know-how/35<p>my problem was that i had every photo i'd ever taken over the last 12 years! i've never deleted anything - or looked at them. i've backed them up on to 8 bluray discs so far.<p>so i needed a way to shrink my collection to a manageble, share-worthy collection. this isn't a one day job, more like something thats going to take months - so i wrote a program that would index my collection, identify duplicates, and let me step through the unique photos one at a time and tag the good ones - then i can export to a date based folder structure.<p>now my collection is a more reasonable size, and structured well on the disk - i'm exporting it as i go, and loading it up in picasa and sharing on google+. btw, if i exit the app, when i reopen it i can continue from where i left off.<p>i've got over 50000 photos, turns out nearly half are duplicates, but i'm over 20% of the way through my collection and my family are finally getting to see the photos!<p>see http://photo-sorter.appspot.com/﻿<p>but so far, no-one has given me any feedback - not a single one - so i don't know if anyone other than me actually thinks this is a worthwhile idea or if no-one has found it yet! any thoughts?	2013-03-17 01:38:20 UTC		3	3

4505705	major ios6 / facebook privacy issue	hi, i'm an ios developer with a device running ios6. i'll try to stick to the nda, but i'd just like an answer regarding what i view as a major privacy issue. by the way, i had another account on hn but lost access to it in the transition away from clickpass.<p>to summarise the issue: ios6's facebook integration allows me to simply add a stranger's phone number and then, in most cases, retrieve their facebook photo, url, name and occasionally email addresses and sometimes, though infrequently, actual addresses, depending on the user's facebook privacy settings.<p>steps to recreate the issue:<p>1. link your facebook account to the device<p>2. add a person's phone number<p>3. go to settings &#62; facebook and tap "update contacts"<p>4. return to the contacts app and there is a high chance that you will now have this person's photo, a link to their facebook profile, and potentially other information, all from a phone number. something which i don't believe can be done through any other means.<p>i find this to be a major breach of privacy, and i don't see how apple or facebook would allow this. i thought the point was to synchronise information from existing facebook friends, not strangers.<p>i apologise if this is old news but i'd have thought this would be a huge issue with the tech community—particularly since it involves apple and facebook—and i check hn, reddit, etc. daily.<p>thank you	2012-09-11 14:56:20 UTC		3	3

496062	ask hn: what motivates you to keep working despite government bailout/theft 	(sorry for the repost; the thread got killed last night for some reason)<p>us is 65 trillion dollars in debt (and i am not a baby boomer who mortgaged our great country away), and just spent 3 trillions. the older generations are gonna want us to work extra hard to pay off their debt, or the government is gonna inflate our money away. why should i work so hard, slaving day and night on my project, when they're just gonna steal the end values?<p>that's what i want to know. what motivates you guys to keep working? because i'm on the verge of giving up (i've got 15 years of living expenses saved up, so i can either spend it on the startup, or just live a quiet life)<p>i feel like john galt and just want to say 'i will stop the motor of the world', and walk away. what keeps you guys going?	2009-02-26 16:54:56 UTC		3	5
6913083	ask hn: information systems versus computer science	for the people out there that are in the business of making money from computer related stuff. how viable in the job market is an information systems degree with a minor in computer science, as opposed to a computer science degree. (just a bachelors for both).<p>reason being, i am currently a computer science major and i am not exactly fond of the calculus, i can do it, i&#x27;d just rather not, and after doing some research on the subject. i discovered that computer science tends to be more research&#x2f;academia related now, and mis is more aimed at business. although these opinions were that of yahoo answers and some random google searches. i figured i&#x27;d ask my trusted hn community for more insight on the topic.<p>thank you for taking the time to answer this.	2013-12-16 05:25:45 UTC		3	5

2556904	ask hn: any advice in finding a reliable programmer?	a year ago, i started to build a social networking game on facebook through delegation; i would hire the artists and the programmer out of pocket. i had a good job then and i leaned myself from bad, wasteful habits, like eating out, going out, buying games, gadgets, etc. i would just pay my bills, food and focus everything on paying my people.<p>i bought a mafia wars blank canvas clone from a russian programmer, railorz.com, and i also bought modifications from him. the game is written in ror with some php, ajax, fbml and ssas. well, he started to get busy with other projects and walked away to make room. so i looked for another programmer running dxwebdesigns.com, but after working for 2 weeks he wanted me to accept some new and pretty draconian terms, namely that i had to get a new server from him, get a new domain from him and give him total control of my database. when i refused he did a bunch of damage to the server!<p>the railorz.com guy responded to my email asking for help and accepted a job to fix the damage. i also found an indian guy with little experience, but cheap, and i had him learn from the russian anything he could while he could, as his time is limited.<p>the game was fixed, but it is barely functional, running in about 20% efficiency. i still have some pretty big bugs such as players no longer being able to level up, items page not available, etc.<p>i have my first 20 players yesterday right after i launched, but now that there is people waiting for it the pressure is higher to get it fixed fast.<p>i sent an email last night to both of my current programmers and i haven't gotten a response yet. i really need advice finding a reliable ror programmer. i lost my job 6 months ago, but i do have some savings to pay them from, since my lifestyle is so lean in spending, but i can't continue guessing when he will have the time for me, because this game is what is going to be paying my bills and the savings are in the red.<p>i was thinking of getting another blank canvas built from good php and although it is more likely for me to find php programmers than ror, the issue at the end of the day is to have someone that responds.<p>thank you.<p>my facebook page: www.lutopia.co	2011-05-17 16:44:45 UTC		4	8
9861642	ask hn: i don't care enough about anything to be great. how can i change that?	i am a generally happy person, and live a pretty good life. i read. i program a little bit for fun. i have a really great and interesting job. i am generally successful (by an average person&#x27;s standards).<p>but, when it comes to actually doing things -- anything that would make someone awesome (creating things, putting myself out there, helping others, etc) -- i am completely lacking any impetus to do more than what is required to live a decent life.<p>i see people that have written really complex and useful pieces of software, or have composed brilliant works of music&#x2f;art, or have built businesses that help us live modern life, or run charities that truly help people in need. people that create culture. people that inspire others. i know that based on how i live my life i will never be one of these people.<p>i wouldn&#x27;t describe myself as lazy, necessarily (though you might!). i have just never done anything beyond the bare minimum. it has worked out reasonably well by most people&#x27;s standards, but i want to do more.<p>i am not just looking for words here... i really need a plan of action. a list of things i can do (not just think about) that could potentially lead to doing more.	2015-07-10 00:28:55 UTC		4	11

3081001	i'm not personally mourning steve jobs' death	my condolences to his family and friends. he made a lot of money. he indirectly made a lot of people happy with the products and services provided by companies for which he worked. he was a good front man. woz made the apple computer, he just helped sell it. he didn't make the mac, he just joined the mac team after the lisa failed. he didn't make the ipod, itouch, iphone, ipad, or ianything. he helped hire good people, and between he and tim cook, helped lead them and provide advice. he was a great man. and, i'm sure that his family is grateful for your praise. but, even though i use apple products and loved my apple as a kid through college, i do not attribute to steve all that you do. cancer is a completely terrible way to die. if you want to do a tribute to steve, consider donating time or effort toward getting rid of it. i personally don't appreciate all of these token posts making the man seem like a god. in my opinion, he wasn't.	2011-10-06 18:07:13 UTC		5	8

424549	i've coded a product.. now what?	hello, hn.<p>i've had tons of start-up ideas in the past and just never executed them, because, well, i had to pay the bills.  but after saving money from my prior job i was able to quit and work my own things.<p>despite getting off to a slow start, meaning, i went skydiving and pursued hobbies, and little interesting technical problems, i've finally managed to have a lot to show for myself.  i've been working an unhealthy 12 hours a day for 2 months straight.  i'm nearly ready for a beta release of something that will definitely make waves.  no point going into how hyped i am, because, well, that's part of the deal being in this business... everyone's got the greatest idea.<p>up to now, i provided my own seed money and essentially all of the ideas and technology are home-brewed.  now that i have something to show, i do not know who to show it to, or really what steps to take.<p>there's the entire other side of the business besides technical.  how do i market it?  how do i keep this afloat if/when it gets too large for me to handle myself?  how can i get funding, very soon, so that i can have a team of people churning away at the larger scale ideas behind this?<p>i'm hoping you all can offer some guidance.<p>a few things about my product:
- it's a discussion system compatible with all websites.
- it's not a browser plug-in (eg: no barrier to entry).
- it does everything most discussions systems do (this one, reddit, etc), except better.  you can follow people and see what comments they're posting on what websites, get notified when people reply to your comments, watch specific posts for replies... all of this across the entire web.
- super slick and fast-loading ui
- it will destroy disqus, not only because it is better, but because of point #1.
- and, soon, it will connect with facebook so that what you post goes to your news feed, and you can invite and follow your friends.<p>so, i ask:
- what should i do next?
- do i even need funding?
- how do i market this?
- do you see this product as being valuable, based on its description?<p>thanks.	2009-01-08 06:25:59 UTC		5	13

3951878	boredom worries	i hadn’t ever really considered grad school.<p>and yet, the thought occurred to me recently: “once building things is truly trivial, and it becomes just a matter of manpower and money, will it still be fun?” it sounds like management. it sounds like something i wouldn’t like.<p>what would i do then? could i just work my way into interesting situations? what’s the best way to prepare for a technically interesting career?<p>i talked to a professor today about these fears, and he told me straight up the only way to avoid this was to go to grad school (specifically, becoming a phd), or start/join a startup.<p>i’m not convinced of anything, but it got me thinking.<p>my gpa is only slightly better than decent and i’m not really friends with any professors. i don’t go to a top school, and it doesn’t look like i would ever get into one. i was assuming that i could just take a job somewhere where they had a good track for individual contributors, and i would just work my way into any situation that seemed fun.<p>data mining and machine learning interest me in that they seem to be right at the cusp of statistics and computer science, two subjects i’ve enjoyed classes in, and there seems to be enough demand in industry for it. i’ve never done it though. most job postings indicate that at least a masters is needed to do data mining stuff, so there’s that, but i don’t see exactly why a masters specifically would be necessary. it’s just another year of school right? is this some sort of hint that employers actually only want phds or could i do it with just undergrad?<p>failing that, i have no clue what i would want to specialize in. i’m sure anything would be fun considering that a field can only exist if people are interested in it and there’s significant depth to the subject, so i’m not really biased towards or against anything.<p>and yet, i don’t want to feel trapped in grad school. i’ve heard the horror stories about grad school that fueled my disinterest in it, but now i’m not so sure, especially in a technical field. and of course, there’s the scott thompson “drop out now!” crowd.<p>let me clarify my intentions: i’m definitely not worried about getting software engineering jobs. i’m past that. just after that, what is there?<p>what keeps work interesting for people long term?	2012-05-10 04:35:52 UTC		6	4

2682198	the state of university didactics	universities are the place where two main processes take place:
1) students reach the highest grades of education
2) cutting-edge research<p>most of the people working inside universities work both as teachers and researchers, but they perform the two tasks in very different ways.<p>modern research activities take often (almost always?) advantage of international teams of people, peer review and in some ways go beyond the single university.<p>didactics, on the other hand, is far back behind as far as i can see (in italy, at least): every teacher seems to be reinventing the wheel in every single course of every single faculty in every single university, even if most subjects are widely overlapped.<p>i think this is a big disadvantage for both teachers and students: for the formers it means more work; for the latters it mean a more partial vision of the subject and more error prone didactic contents. if i were a teacher, i'd like to see other teachers' contents, peer review them and maybe use them as my course (under some sort of licence). as a student, i would like to be given easy access to high quality didactic contents even if they are not written by my teacher or inside my university.<p>i also think wikipedia and google are not enough here, since i'm talking about university-teacher curated university-grade contents. arxiv and similars neither, because i'm not looking for papers.<p>isn't this a major issue in the university didactics? what is the state of didactics in your university?	2011-06-22 08:00:52 UTC		8	6

6179227	dedicated server vs. own server, suggestions?	ok, our company is growing in users <i>fast</i>!!!, we use a dedicated server service provided by a well known company, but their service sucks, their technical support is a joke, sometimes connection fails, the price is also excessive, upgrading memory on our rental server isn’t really an option, memory upgrade would nearly double our monthly fee. so, we’re looking at buying our own server, the initial up front cost would be high, but we will save some money in the long run.

4190147	web design: fluid vs. fixed-fluid/responsive...?	so, i'm currently trying to decide the best way to approach this here. i am currently designing my website to be responsive to varying screen sizes. however, while i started off using a fluid grid, i didn't like it much. for instance, in too many instances, proportions were thrown off when the width would change but not the height.<p>i opted for remaining responsive, but just using a fixed grid/layout within each parameter. i.e. cell phone, tablet, ultrabook, desktop, etc. i can always refining it more and more (although could become a pain managing too many screen sizes). however, since i like white space anyway, i just design at the smaller end of each screen size range and then just let white space / gutters grow until hitting the top of the range. when i hit the new breaking point, i change the grid, i'll adjust again.<p>is this common practice? or are just sticking with more fluid grids still recommended?<p>any advice?	2012-07-02 18:27:59 UTC		10	3

2048844	hn contest: invent the perfect hn-link-bait title	i know we don't do jokes around here very much (unless they are a small part of a comment and in support of a greater point) but i thought that it might be fun to have a contest for folks to come up with the types of article titles they see on hn that strikes them as being link-bait.<p>i figure not only could this be fun/funny, but it also might help the community take a fresh look at the kinds of material we're seeing on the front page (and whether we like it or not)<p>so what's the best title to guarantee a huge hn response? what are the things we reflexively upvote?	2010-12-29 15:14:04 UTC		17	21

2651520	ask hn: possible to recover from being a frustrated mediocrity for 30+ years?	i've been reading hn for awhile. i'm using a throwaway account to ask for advice.<p>basically, i am a failure. i do about three hours of work in a month, seriously. and i'm an entrepreneur with a dream schedule! i'm floating along on some contracts but it's only a matter of time before i'm found out.  more importantly i detest myself for this.<p>i've read god knows how many posts about finding your vision and achieving goals. i know what my perfect day looks like but i can't ever follow through. it's awful. i have a sick feeling in my stomach every night as another day is wasted. there's no end.<p>the worst is being a member of hn where so many accomplished people work. seriously, if i could break this mental block or disease or whatever i could be like that! at least i think i could. i'm so bored with fp vs op, language debates, stack overflow book recs and all that because i've studied them all before. i should be teaching the guys who ask those questions with my experience by now, yet i have no experience...<p>i'm over 30 years old. can i change? is it too late? has anybody like me ever changed? if so i would love to hear from you.<p>all suggestions welcome. however, i do need to keep earning a living so taking a year off in tibet is not going to work for me very well.	2011-06-14 02:01:39 UTC		21	16

Now that the holidays are a couple months behind us, and winter still drags on, many Coloradans are looking forward to their next break in the year. Summer is still a few months away but it’s not too early to start planning summer activities to look forward to. Once the snow melts, Vail ATV tours are one of the most popular summer activities in the high country. For folks living in Denver, Vail ATV rentals are only and hour and a half drive away or less. Not having to combat the winter conditions and traffic also adds an incentive to visit the mountains more frequently in the summer.  	1	0

3228184	help wanted: reach 1111 1's in homepage's source code	i started a blog yesterday at 11:11:11 utc. it's purpose is to celebrate imagination, ideas and the digit 1. the goal now is, as defined above, to reach 1111 1's in the homepage's source code. if you go to <i>http://1p1e1.tumblr.com/</i> and do 'view page source' and search for 1, you will see that i already have 555 1's. but i need your help. how? by writing a story together.<p>write a word in the comments here on hn, which i will immediately add to the 'hacker news story' section in my code. let's imagine together.<p>there are several rules. bear with me.
0) the story writing is turn based, so 1 person can write 1 word per turn.
1) 1 = one
2) 1-e = on
3) -o1 = ne
4) a person can write 2 words if one of them is 1: 1 day, no 1, etc.<p>examples:
1 day = one day
some1 = someone
negotiate = (-o1)gotiate 
toner = t1r
on monday i found my mind was gone. = 1-e m(1-e)day i found my mind was g1.<p>if you come up with a new rule define it in the comments like:
- rule: 1-e = on<p>when you write a comment define the word(s) you want to add like:
- story: t1r<p>so i start with:
1 day …<p>your turn. 1… 1… 1… go!	2011-11-12 17:00:05 UTC		1	0

6490247	ask hn: how to estimate purchase price of an expiring domain?	i am looking to get a domain that expires in december. the domain in question has appeal only really to people who have the same first initial and last name name as me. the .io is not taken, the .{net,org,com} all are taken but expire soon and haven&#x27;t been updated lately (since 2009)leading me to believe that they will not renew.<p>many sites exist to appraise domains:
www.{valuate,estibot}.com lists the domain as &quot;worth&quot; $1,200.<p>these appraisals do not seem to be the value in terms of purchasing a domain that seems only useful as a personal site. while i have a popular last name and first initial if i don&#x27;t get the domain i won&#x27;t be overly disappointed as i can still get the .io.<p>i know there are some statistical approaches for estimating a domain value, but they require data on &quot;similar&quot; sites, ie real estate:
http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.domainmart.com&#x2f;news&#x2f;statistical_models_for_market_approach_to_domain_name_value.pdf<p>as i am only looking at evaluating the purchase price of a single domain, i would like a simple way of estimating a purchase price that i can scale by a bayesian probability of my &quot;satisfaction&quot; with having the domain vs cost.<p>any input would be cool.	2013-10-03 16:56:13 UTC		1	0

1346748	3 reasons to choose a dedicated server	3 reasons to choose a dedicated server<p>a dedicated server is a web server that is devoted to one customer, thus giving that customer all of the resources they need to effectively run their website without experiencing server downtime or other pitfalls. although dedicated servers are available to every customer, they are usually only used by larger businesses due to their high cost and overwhelming amount of server resources. most small business owners would not necessarily need a dedicated server, but nonetheless it is a common solution for small business owners as well. one of the reasons why a dedicated server is so suitable for the large business owner is because the server setup is completely customizable and expandable. the following reasons should help you decide if a dedicated server would be suitable for your online business.<p>enhanced customer service<p>aside from nearly unlimited server resources, dedicated hosting plans get the best customer service from any hosting company, as these plans are given priority over other hosting plans. since your server is dedicated to your site only, the host can work with you to make sure your server is meeting all of your needs. you’ll usually have shorter wait times on the support line, and you’ll be able to have the server configured to your likings, unlike shared hosting plans which only give you restricted access to server configuration. in essence, having a dedicated hosting plan is the same as leasing your very own private server in a remote location.<p>multiple domain hosting<p>with your own dedicated server, you could also host multiple domains without having to use different software to manage each domain. meaning all of your domains could use the same control panel, the same shopping cart, and even the same point of sale software. all of this software could be installed on multiple websites simultaneously since each website is hosted on the same server. you could also have several dedicated ip addresses for each website to maximize site performance. hosting multiple domains on the same server is a must for any online business owner that regularly operates several websites at once.<p>reselling<p>perhaps the most advantageous aspect of having a dedicated server would be the reselling capabilities. if you want to have all of the aforementioned features of a dedicated web server, but you do not necessarily need all of the extra resources, then you could opt to resell some of the resources allocated to you and then use the rest as you please. most dedicated hosting plans will give you the right to resell your resources, since the server resources will only be used by you. if you’re in the business of offering web services such as web development, then you may want to consider a dedicated hosting plan as you’ll be able to offer your customers server resources in combination with the existing plans you have on offer. bundling your services is one of the best way to sell hosting plans and make a profit with a dedicated server.<p>http://www.version-next.com/dedicated-servers/index.html	2010-05-14 06:55:55 UTC	http://www.version-next.com/blog/index.php/2010/05/05/3-reasons-to-choose-a-dedicated-server/	1	0

7875315	ask hn: customer discovery exercise – iot hardware development challenges?	i have a startup which we are gearing up to address some of the problems that iot hardware (and software) developers may be facing. i am intentionally leaving this little vague because the whole exercise is to gather your experience without leading to our &quot;hypothesis&quot; and not because we are trying to be secret about our startup (in fact, it&#x27;s public in the interweb already).<p>as part of the customer discovery exercise through our accelerator, we are looking for developers who have had experience with or are going through developing internet-connected embedded devices to share some information on one-on-one basis. i wanted to see if there are any kind souls who would be willing to spend about 15 minutes on a video chat or even on a phone call to answer some of our questions about your development process. i created a gmail account for you to directly message me for this: customer.discoveries@gmail.com. please email me so we can set up a time.<p>here are some of the questions we are looking to answer:<p><pre><code>  * share your general development process from hardware to supporting infrastructure
  * biggest challenges you&#x27;ve faced during your development process
  * distribution of team and&#x2f;or workload between hardware design&#x2f;build&#x2f;test, embedded programming, and server design&#x2f;build&#x2f;test
  * what third-party tools or services you&#x27;ve used and why? who made the ultimate decision (developer or team lead)?
  * if you had to do it again, what would you change?
</code></pre>
there are few more that i want to go into detail, so please please please let me know if you can help out as we are building our startup! thanks!	2014-06-10 21:04:35 UTC		1	1

6793841	ask hn: i have trouble finding the right js/canvas solution	i&#x27;m still a novice when it comes to javascript and though i did a few smaller projects in angular and dabbled a bit in using canvas for games i&#x27;m far from having the knowledge to find the right answer to most problems.<p>i&#x27;ve been working on a project that involves a large amount of images which need to be moved, resized and categorized. i think it&#x27;s comparable to what microsoft has shown on the surface. so far it&#x27;s pretty static, which means instead of dragging pictures into zones to tag them i just select them by clicking on them and then open a dialog. pretty easy to do, pretty useless for large amounts of images. using the dom and a framework everything is cut out to solve this problem.<p>problem is, it is too slow and too rigid. i wanted to add selection by drawing a box, or even a polygon with a pen. to my understanding this is both possible in canvas and webgl, but neither allow me to use the dom or frameworks build on top. there are frameworks which make the canvas more accessible, but they are all targeted at making games and basically no interaction which is made easy with dom + js is implemented.<p>is this a gap in the world of js no one has yet filled? the only remotely active framework that promises more than just game development is kineticjs. i havent found any project using it and flagship projects like mozilla&#x27;s bespin were all abandoned in favor of projects like cloud 9 or ace which use the dom.<p>i feel like i would be stuck rolling out my own solution to this problem, which is far out of my reach.	2013-11-25 13:13:26 UTC		1	1

757200	ask hn: do ajax enabled user registration pages increase conversions?	i am in the middle of creating a new site/business which will ask all users to register an account as well as submit their credit card for payment of the service.<p>right now i am working on my user registration page. for me this is the most overwhelming part because there are so many things you have to validate as well as getting the credit card info processed correctly.<p>currently all the validation/processing is done on the back-end once the user clicks "submit". if there is a validation or processing error, the registration form is displayed again. after polling a few friends on the matter, i was told that i should <i>not</i> repopulate the password or credit card info (number, cvv, billing zip) on the page because this would probably breach a lot of security stuff and possible pci regulations. i agree they shouldn't be repopulated.<p>but, this presents a rough user experience, because if they goof one thing (email confirmation, for example) they end up having to fill in a lot of the form over again.<p>i also heard suggestions to use ajax to do some validation work on the front-end before really sending the info to the back-end for final processing. to me, this adds another level of complexity and another point of failure to the system; however this seems to be a much nicer user experience because validation errors are found quicker/easier and they can be corrected before final submission.<p>so, my question is (finally): for those that have gone through this process, what is your recommendation? does adding ajax validation substantially raise registration/conversion rates?	2009-08-12 03:33:24 UTC		1	3

7534442	ask hn: how to ensure reasonable entropy in linux?	so today i am trying to install freeipa in a vm on proxmox ve.  neither the hypervisor nor the guest seem to have sufficient entropy to complete the install, per the developers.  on advice from irc, i found out how to check entropy using &#x27;cat &#x2f;proc&#x2f;sys&#x2f;kernel&#x2f;random&#x2f;entropy_avail&#x27;.<p>results:<p><pre><code>  - desktop: 1456

  - hypervisor: 262

  - guest: 94
</code></pre>
suggestions i&#x27;ve seen so far are:<p>1. implement virtio-rng for my vm. this would share and throttle the hypervisor&#x27;s &#x2f;dev&#x2f;random with the guest.  this does little good imho, if even the hypervisor is starved of entropy.  http:&#x2f;&#x2f;wiki.qemu-project.org&#x2f;features-done&#x2f;virtiorng<p>2. haveged - &quot;a simple entropy daemon&quot;; any thoughts on this?  http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.issihosts.com&#x2f;haveged&#x2f;<p>i would enjoy having a hardware rng, but i wonder what software can do to solve this issue.  
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;en.wikipedia.org&#x2f;wiki&#x2f;comparison_of_hardware_random_number_generators<p>i seem to remember the random numbers as a service post about the nist recently.  is that worth looking into for this?	2014-04-04 21:15:06 UTC		2	3
8700244	cannabis testing for hiring engineers- can corporations supersede the law?	now that oregon and alaska have joined washington and colorado on the marijuana legalization bandwagon, how are companies that drug test new engineering hires coping?<p>drug testing for marijuana has always been a ridiculous practice, as marijuana stays in the system long after its direct mental effects have worn off. it&#x27;s also, very obviously, much more conducive to software development than alcohol, for example, which no one tests for. furthermore, with increasing evidence that marijuana is not only good at treating certain conditions, but also good at preventing and inhibiting certain cancers and glaucoma, it seems that engineers who make a conscious, healthy choice to use marijuana are being told by potential employers that they need to sacrifice their health for work.<p>yet some companies, particularly those that engage in work with federal agencies (especially the dot), continue to test for marijuana as a condition of employement, even in states where marijuana use is legal or decriminalized. this seems to me to be an egregious overreach of corporate powers, and potentially even grounds for employment discrimination lawsuits.<p>what experiences have you had with employers that drug test engineers? if you work for a company that tests, how do you address the issue when hiring engineers, especially in legal states?	2014-12-04 17:04:13 UTC		2	3

like everyone else, i need a good program that will backup and synchronise my files across computers. i don't trust dropbox with all my data, so i came across spideroak and paid for a yearly account.<p>however, spideroak takes up 100% of my cpu for minutes on end, regularly freezes in some states, and a few days ago it stopped working altogether (it refuses to synchronise, it just sits there taking up all my cpu and even my attempts to reinstall it have been thwarted as it freezes on "downloading data").<p>is there a <i>reliable</i>, zero-knowledge program that will backup and synchronise data across computers? it's something indispensable but i'm disappointed with how buggy spideroak is, and all the alternatives i've seen are either backup-only or not zero-knowledge...<p>i'd appreciate any help!	2011-04-08 12:05:03 UTC		3	15

3484941	ask hn: who is likely to benefit from sopa?	i am from india and know next to nothing about law making procedures in united states. as an indian my experience is that the rulers first look at their self interests first and then only provide some verbal convolutions to describe how the proposed law will help the ordinary citizens. if it does benefit the general public its mostly by pure accident. well, being mostly and illiterate nation the degree to which our rulers succeed is very high.<p>i dont think the basic motivation of politicians in united states is likely to be much different. i hear the deep pocketed companies influence the politicians a lot in usa.<p>can it be the case that the non technology companies such as oil companies and financial organizations which have been the most valued companies in last few decades felt threatened that new technology companies like apple, google etc. will grow much bigger than them and influence the lawmakers more than non-tech companies ?<p>if there are less and less start ups, if google and facebook find it difficult to operate wouldn't these people be benefited the most?	2012-01-19 15:49:57 UTC		4	4
309982	exclusivity contracts are killing entrepenenurs - can we kill them?	exclusivity contracts are killing the entrepreneurs in this country. my past two ventures have hit hard roadblocks due to entrenched players having exclusive access to provide goods and services to large companies.<p>here are the kinds of exclusivity contracts i'm talking about (the examples i ran into deal with smaller players, but in spirit this is the kind of thing i'm talking about):<p>* at&#38;t is the exclusive provider of iphone. if you wanted to start a cellular network, you could not provide the phone that most people want.<p>* ticketmaster is the 'exclusive' provider of tickets at all major venues. if you wanted to sell tickets, you couldn't at these places.<p>* sony pays konami to only publish a game (metal gear solid 4) for their playstation 3 platform.<p>* visa and mastercard pay stores to only provide their cards and exclude other cards.<p>* google paying myspace to be the sole search provider for their web site (and ms doing the same with facebook).<p>in my perfect world, all of these contracts would be illegal because they artificially raise the barrier of entry for entrepreneurs like us. it is not the 'market' ie, customers deciding which service provider is the best and most innovative, it is the businesses themselves negotiating the best rate and putting smaller players out of the competition.<p>in my opinion, the above is no different then standard oil promising the rail road companies a paycheck each month for a discount on shipping costs (which is one of the main reasons they were identified as a monopoly that needed to be broken up). in fact, i don't think standard oil should of been broken up, they should of changed the laws so that it becomes easier for competitors to enter the market place (which they did as well - make rail road companies charge the same rates to everybody, etc.).<p>my question to hacker news - is there any basis to bringing up a case with the doj, name all the companies above in the suit, and get rid of these moronic 'exclusivity agreements' once and for all? or does the company have to be an obvious monopoly (ala standard oil/ticketmaster) and even then is the only recourse to break up the company (which is incredible stupid)?	2008-09-20 17:44:12 UTC		4	5

6218412	ask hn: made mvp at hackathon, validated idea, but no longer have developer.	hey hn,<p>i work as a photographer &amp; videographer right now, and editing and reviewing video is a painful process. going back and forth with clients and involved parties sucks, so i came up with a possible solution and didn&#x27;t think much of it.<p>a few weeks ago while photographing a tech conference, i decided to join the hackathon and build an idea i had with my friend. he did all the heavy back-end lifting, and i did the front end work. we didn&#x27;t know what would come out of it, but ended up winning &#x27;most monetizeable&#x27; and getting great feedback from all of the judges and many participants.<p>long story short, my friend has stated that he has absolutely no intention of wanting to work on it (he&#x27;s already at a startup) and has agreed to me continuing to work on it without his help. i&#x27;ve showed potential customers the demo, and have received great feedback from other videographers, including a value of $100~ per project as a baseline.<p>i want to continue with it, but am not sure what to do. i don&#x27;t have the programming skills to do all of the back end right now (node.js) but am willing to learn it. at the same time, the alpha (if you can call it that) is basically done, and doesn&#x27;t need too much work before it can go live.<p>thoughts?	2013-08-15 15:32:18 UTC		4	6

821365	ask hn: how to made a windows-tied library cross-platform?	our main language (delphi) will be, most probably, cross-platform in its next version.<p>while writing a cross-compiler isn't a thing which interests us very much now, porting a library which was/is windows-tied to multiple platforms, /certainly/ does.<p>you can think, for example at vcl (delphi's standard library). while it was designed for windows only, it has value in it, and, of course, there are huge codebases which depend on it.<p>the question is: which would be the best approach to made an application / library cross-platform aware ensuring a smooth conversion / upgrade path (as much as possible of course)?<p>i stress it again, we are not interested which is the best way to do cross-platform development <i></i>only<i></i> (there were questions on this theme). we are interested <i>also</i> in yet another requirement: the old code base / installations management.<p>ps: experiences and/or methodologies from similar situations with other languages (eg. c/c++) which are regarded as standard practices are welcomed.<p>thanks in advance.	2009-09-14 09:19:35 UTC		4	8
4146747	ask hn: how to write code that can be taken over by others?	i am an experienced programmer and about to start a community funded project. if things work out fine, i will be payed for one month writing lua code (for luatex, but that won't matter i guess). after that month, the perfect situation would be a working piece of code where more people will jump in and fix bugs, enhance it and such.<p>this code will require expert knowledge (opentype and tex knowledge).<p>what are guidelines to write code so that other people have a chance to jump in? the current piece of code (which we want to replace) is mostly a black box to us and is too clever (for some definition of cleverness) and more or less undocumented (it has other problems as well, but they don't matter here).  what is your advice here? some things are obvious: documentation, unit tests, getting other people involved as soon as possible, writing with "openness" in mind etc. but my fear is that i end with complex code which has the same problem as the now existing code and i will be the only person maintaining it.<p>can you give advice how to lower the barrier for other people? anybody has practical experience?	2012-06-22 13:54:14 UTC		4	8

2086768	own 50% of cashflow from iphone app if you help complete it	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsff61nrtqy<p>above is a marketing video we produced (one of many actually).<p>some friends and i designed an iphone app with the goal of making it safer to make calls while driving. the app is called safelane and is basically a dynamic "favorite" list that you have on the native phone app. users can add/edit/delete items on the call list in the app or using the web.<p>the two use cases we wanted the mvp to support were:<p>(1) user knows they have a 1 hour commute later in the day so, while in their office, using the web interface they add 5 calls to their safelane call list and they then make those calls while driving.<p>(2) user's assistant adds 5 calls to user's safelane call list from assistant's office using web interface (think sales person driving between meetings).<p>the reason safelane is safer to use than the native phone app is that the user/driver has only to select a few (larger, easy to glance at) options instead of scrolling through emails, or worse, their address book.  the graphic design of the app accounts for this and has giant buttons that are easy to use at a glance.<p>the iphone app is 80% complete and alpha versions are working on actual phones. the website is about half done. we spent some time/money creating a nice looking website and produced a marketing video. check it out here http://www.reserver1.com/safelane/content/home/home.aspx (ie only right now).<p>if you're interested in helping finish the app (i'm guessing about 40 hours of work for someone who know what they're doing) then we'd cut you in for 50% of the free cash flow. this isn't a business but it could be an interesting app that makes a little money and (hopefully) saves some lives.<p>thanks for reading.	2011-01-09 23:19:31 UTC	http://www.reserver1.com/safelane/content/home/home.aspx 	5	10

8193954	how did buffett obtain the large capital to initially start investing?	i know that he was always into finding different ways to earn money since a young age, i.e. putting gaming machines in public places, paper route etc... all of these things tie into his incredible work ethic, however, they certainly didn&#x27;t generate much income.<p>initially he said that he started with only 10k after graduating from university. starting with 10k is a very small amount and would take significant time to grow even if he was making several multiples on his investments.<p>with that said, you need reletively large sums of capital to make significant profits, so i&#x27;m guessing he was running a hedge fund of some sort in the early days and investing other peoples money and taking a percentage?<p>can anyone back this up?<p>thanks.	2014-08-18 18:53:57 UTC		9	5

488357	ask hn: quick wins for your business?	i thought, hey, since there are a bunch of smart people here, we might be able to share some little minor practices or projects we found were effective.  sure, most things are business specific, but i'm betting we can all benefit a lot from some generally applicable tips.<p>my contribution:<p>i used to spend an unhealthy amount of time doing metrics navelgazing -- go to google analytics, go to payment processor logs, go to email, etc.  a good deal of it was just a nervous habit -- wonder how many sales i made today, wonder whether this month will be better than last month, etc.  and it always turned out to be the same four or five metrics.<p>so i build myself a dashboard on my site, which used apis and data i already had, and put all those metrics on /private/dashboard, behind a http basic password prompt.  this took me an hour and has saved me dozens.  every time i find myself doing repetitive processes (looking up customer keys, etc), that process gets added to the sidebar on the dashboard.<p>thus its one click access to a quick business health-check and two clicks to get to essentially anything i do more than once a month.  the roi on time is impressive -- now instead of spending 5 minutes logging into my payment processor, clicking "access transaction log", and typing in parameters to answer the question "what are sales like this month as compared to last month?", its something i can catch out of the corner of my eye as i do productive work.	2009-02-20 05:27:42 UTC		27	10

10145897	is it actually impossible to follow best practices for svg in angular	it seems like every tutorial on svg&#x27;s in angular is incomplete, and many people using svg&#x27;s in angular are finding hacky solutions.<p>first off it seems you must use the image tag if you include an svg, meaning you cannot color using css.<p>second you have strange support with how ng-href passes its value to xlink:href<p>what bothers me the most is the level of disinformation, nobody is outright saying angular has chosen to not support svg&#x27;s.<p>so am i totally wrong? please tell me so.	2015-08-31 07:51:03 UTC		1	0

5888255	ask hn: snowden: when does ethnical whistleblowing cross into defection?	at first i fell in with the bandwagon hailing snowden as a true american hero for blowing the whistle on the prism surveillance program, as well as anecdotes of other unethical&#x2f;illegal behavior on the part of the intelligence agencies.<p>however, the narrative of the ethnical whistleblower, the hero, started to fall apart once i heard he fled to china (hk, but still china).  first - the supreme irony that he claims the us is a surveillance state while praising the china (suffice it to say, the one state with the most complete surveillance infrastructure on the planet -- and does <i>anyone</i> think that the chinese intelligence services don&#x27;t have their fingers all throughout hk telecom?). second - now that his &quot;whistleblowing&quot; goes beyond exposing illegal domestic intelligence collecting activity to wholesale exposure of defense&#x2f;foreign intelligence related work. if he wanted the free people of a free country to decide his fate, why not go to switzerland or iceland?<p>daniel ellsburg is an unequivocated american hero, by contrast. he uncovered the lie of the vietnam war, but didn&#x27;t produce lame justifications for defecting to the soviet union.<p>so to wrap it up - when&#x2f;if snowden sits down with a chinese intelligence officer to tell all the dirty little secrets, is he still the &quot;hero&quot; he once was?	2013-06-16 12:40:49 UTC		1	0

9928801	ask hn: animation vs. live action video for app demo	i&#x27;m working on app redesign and i need to show users how to use new gestures to control the app.
here&#x27;s what my in-app animation draft looks like when a user clicks &quot;show gestures&quot; button:
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;youtu.be&#x2f;sjrbqp3x6zq<p>is this animation clear enough to demonstrate the gestures? 
alternatively here&#x27;s a draft of live action video that shows the same thing:
https:&#x2f;&#x2f;youtu.be&#x2f;v3myhbxct34<p>i think the second video is a clearer depiction, but i don&#x27;t want to send users to watch video online to learn. in-app animation would be a smoother experience. which approach would work better for you?	2015-07-22 10:55:15 UTC		1	0

apple reported $6.9bn of net profits and $9.2bn of operating profits.
samsung meanwhile reported $8.33bn of operating profits.
press is comparing apple&#x27;s net income with samsung&#x27;s operating profit - this is misleading as it does not include several other expenses like taxation and interest&#x2f;extraordinary expenses.
additionally must remember, samsung electronics does much more than mobiles.	2013-07-24 07:00:27 UTC	http://www.apple.com/in/pr/library/2013/07/23Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html	1	0

2464138	ask hn: jargon for "pure hourly rate"	i do a lot of development consulting on a contract basis.  i have a basic rate that assumes that the initial contract negotiation process is out of pocket and that the client is free to take or leave my services at any time.  i much prefer to offer a retainer: a minimum number of hours per month for some agreed period, and will reduce my rate to reflect that preference.<p>i feel like there's got to be a snazzy way to sum that up to some of my potential clients, and is at least a handle for future discussion with the rest.<p>so far, the best i've been able to come up with is "a la carte" rate, but that doesn't seem to hit the mark, exactly.<p>do you know a common term for this "highest risk" hourly rate?	2011-04-19 20:45:23 UTC		1	1

521864	ask hn: is gre useful outside graduate school?	having finished bachelor’s degree in cs and subsequently worked as a professional programmer for 3 years, i am finally considering going to the graduate school. as part of the preparations i will be sitting for the gre general test sometime in next few months. upon reviewing and practicing the test material i realized that something is bugging me really bad.<p>i have heard many people disparage gre. their grudge is that, among a few others, much of what your study for the gre test is not really useful in the graduate school, nor is it helpful later in your career. now that has really started to worry me because i think i am spending more time on it then what i probably ought to.<p>take vocabulary. memorizing hundreds of abstruse words was no fun when i started. i was merely cramming . however, things started getting interesting when i actually began writing down the words, looking the meaning up in a dictionary, analyzing the usage, and applying the words in my own sentences. of course it’s taking inordinate length of time but the experience is really enthralling and edifying.<p>practicing for ‘reading comprehension’ lead me to the world of critical reading and writing. i began to critically read newspaper op-ed , keep an eye on the techniques that author uses to constructs the passages, and find flaws or strength in every argument he or she makes. again it is slowing me down but i am getting engrossed. so much so that i bought an entire text book on logic; one that teaches how to make arguments, identify fallacies, and do deductive and inductive reasoning. my interest only seems to be growing by leaps and the bounds.<p>now i am worried that the amount of effort i am putting into it is just not worth it. everything on the test preparation books too is focused only on maximizing the score on the actual gre test day (quick tricks and tactics without deeper learning).<p>can some of the things i learn for gre can be carried over to the graduate school and the career that follows it? should i be putting as much effort into it as i am doing now?	2009-03-18 16:06:35 UTC		1	3

4044594	problem at my workplace - need suggestions.	i am facing an issue at my workplace. i am not able to get along with few of my coworkers. it annoys me and i don't know how to cope up with it.<p>bugs in code are inevitable and the challenge i think is to resolve those issues as a team (i don't mean by sitting together all the time but just to approach it like a team player). fun is to treat the code as if it belongs to everyone equally.<p>quite lately, i got into a new project with a new set of coworkers and i find the approach of those coworkers a bit strange, at times annoying. problem is, if there is any bug related to the piece of code that i wrote, few of my coworkers treat it as if its totally my responsibility to resolve it ( even if it means to change a line in properties file ). for instance, today it so happened that my coworker found a bug and she saw the error message in logs coming from the class that i wrote. immediately without taking any efforts to debug the code, she turned back to me saying i need to get it resolved and get her moving. it gave me a feeling as if i am being a roadblocker to her. i didn't feel like we were looking at the code as a team. she raised hands as if 'that bug belongs to me and i should get back to her when its resolved'. as it turns out in the end, it was a small fix. it was not really a problem with the code but a change in the properties file she had to make according to a path on her machine. i almost feel as if i am spoon feeding my coworker.<p>not sure if it made any sense to you but if you were in such a situation before then let me know what you did to cope up. i tried telling my coworkers in a calm manner but they don't seem to get it. this behavior has been repeating for couple of months now and i am finding it difficult to get along with others.	2012-05-30 20:09:39 UTC		2	1

3190248	github wikipedia fork using gurl, a gist for a url 	* gurl
a variation on the gist concept.
just adds a url to the other 3 items on the gist form: 
 1. url
 2. name
 3. description
 4. content<p>then, the next time some creates a gist with the same url, or forks your gist, they both become part of the same network graph.<p>you could put some validation on the name or the url to prevent abuse, but all allowed wikipedia pages should probably be legal urls...<p>this would be a super easy way to fork the wikipedia on github.<p>https://github.com/tinku99/gurl<p>github probably dwarfs wikipedia in terms of the amount of data they store. 
so scalability is probably not a show stopper. and gollum already supports mediawiki formatting.<p>although there is a proposal for a distributed wikipedia: http://strategy.wikimedia.org/wiki/proposal:distributed_wiki... i don't think the existing wikipedia is going to disrupt itself like this. it has to come from outside.<p>i think this would finally fork the deletionists into irrelevance.<p>this way, we don't have to deal with parsing the mediawiki content / templates...
we also don't have to worry about github taking responsibility for auto translation of problematic content from wikipedia.  there won't be any auto translation.	2011-11-03 04:16:56 UTC		3	0

1832772	so i built a webapp.  ok, now what?	a few buddies and i spent this summer building facebook apps.  some of them (in my inevitably biased opinion) are pretty fun.<p>one facebook app we made lets people overlay mustaches onto their friends' profile pictures.<p>another facebook app is for compositing your profile picture into the daily show's rally to restore sanity poster.  it shares similarities with twibbon.<p>we thought both of them had a really good chance of becoming viral; yet neither seem to be.  i'm at a loss as to why.  is the original concept bad? did we fail in the execution? do people just not use facebook apps anymore? is "virality" more stochastic than i originally anticipated?<p>more generally, how do you measure the odds of a product gaining lots of traction and users before you actually build it?  i'm sure we all get caught up in our enthusiasm for the projects we are working on; what methods do you use to independently validate your ideas?<p>i apologize for the two differing ideas in this post.  1) if possible, i'd love some feedback on how to make the apps i built better.  2) how about an open discussion on how to validate the worth of your ideas and projects?<p>links to apps:<p>-mustaching app: http://apps.facebook.com/youneedamustache<p>-rally to restore sanity in your profile picture:

7119092	review my project - writeyourrep.org	https:&#x2f;&#x2f;writeyourrep.org<p>i made this because i believe that we should easily be able to communicate with our representatives. it&#x27;s easy to get caught up in the tedium of participating in politics or informing your representatives of your opinions, so i&#x27;ve made it dead simple to send them a letter through the mail.<p>the application lets you select any senator or representative, broken down by state. you simply type your letter, we take care of the rest and mail it to washington, dc.<p>we never read your letters. they are encrypted and added to the printer queue. when the printer processes the letter, it stuffs the envelope automatically. we then delete your encrypted letter from our database entirely.<p>any feedback? i know it&#x27;s pretty rough looking and i&#x27;m working with a designer on facelift.	2014-01-25 00:02:09 UTC		3	4

- handling large data (&#62;300m rows)
- hot columns &#38; indexes additions
- multiple clustered indexes<p>is anyone here using it in production? if so, can you tell a bit about the pros &#38; cons?
did anyone consider it but decided using something else instead? if so, why?	2013-02-17 21:40:42 UTC		3	5

10011092	ask hn: i am trying to give away free $130 products, need marketing advice	my startup, reviewfairy.com, gives away top products in exchange for high-quality product reviews. right now we are giving away $130 home monitoring cameras:<p>https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.reviewfairy.com&#x2f;camera-products.html<p>our general sign-up form for all products is:
www.reviewfairy.com<p>i see user acquisition as a function of traffic and conversion. conversion is hurt by the trust needed for my business (reviewers pay first and then get reimbursed) and probably a host of other things. if you see any easily fixable trust-blockers, please let me know :)<p>i am most curious about traffic channels. though. does anyone have any experience advertising to heavy online-shoppers? i&#x27;ve tried ads but cost per customer has been pretty high. i&#x27;ve tried to apply the traction framework, but it&#x27;s been a tough battle.<p>i am new to the startup world, so any help or feedback would be most appreciated! and if anyone wants to get some of the coolest new tech products for free - please sign up :)	2015-08-05 16:52:43 UTC		5	6

393079	ask hn: finding a job for the rest of my life	i’m facing a dilemma. how do i find a job i could love for the rest of my life? one that keeps me interested, fulfilled, happy, content. or, alternatively, what can i do to make money that will let me be me on my own time. its come to the time in my life when i need to take a sincere look at where my life is heading, and how i plan on living it. some people call it growing up.<p>i’ve been slowly on a mission to discover things about myself. why i don’t like certain things, what things i really love. the only problem is, the result doesn’t provide a clear solution to the problem of what i should try doing with my life.<p>the things i’ve discovered:<p>i love learning. it goes beyond mere excitement and borders on a psychological need. maybe that is the wrong word, it is a need. i could go to school for the rest of my life. i ache to go back to classes, just for the idea that to sit in them would be fun. even in my college days i hardly skipped class. i didn’t always do the homework, but i went to class anyways. i would read through my textbooks for fun. i go to the library and read books about subjects i don’t really need to know. i read in general, and i love every minute of it. i love exploring new places just to see them and eating new foods just because i wonder what its like to try them.<p>i would describe myself as a polymath, but that implies a certain amount of acclaimed accomplishment that goes along with the learning. taking the time to be famous at something has never appealed to me, mostly because that time could be used to learn something new. but one of the best days in my intellectual life was finding the definition of that word, because it meant i was not alone in the world and that other people were like me.<p>i love thinking through problems. it’s the one thing i’m not humble about, i’m good at it. thinking excites me, and thinking through things incites me more. i originally wrote “solve problems.” but that isn’t true. i love thinking of the solutions. but once the solution is thought of, i become disinterested. it requires someone else to put the solution into effect. to build the gadget, write-up the paper, complete the process. the problem is solved in my mind, but until someone else does the work it can’t really be said to be truly solved. but the thinking, ah, the thinking. that is truly where my mind can expand, can envision. i’m definitely a vision guy. i ask way too many questions, but i’m extremely good at throwing away useless information and working out a way to solve something, to get somewhere, to chose a path that will likely work.<p>i hate writing. i hate it with a mix of guilt and resignation. it took me forever to find this out, but again, it was such a relief. every time i realized i did not like what i was doing, it was this. school was a blast until the night before papers were due. tests? sure, love em. studying, of course! but papers? writing? that’s where i get bogged down. i finally figured out that it was the only thing i ever procrastinated on. why? because deep down i don’t like it. i end up disliking the jobs i have when writing becomes heavily involved. my thoughts have already moved on, they’re going new places and solving new problems. putting the old thoughts into writing both bores and paralyzes me.<p>so what should i do with my life? how do i find something that will fulfill me? i’ve thought of academics. being in a constant learning environment would be fun. i’ve though of those idea companies, where you solve problems, but i admit to a problem with execution. they both want you to solve the problem and execute the solution. i know i’ll hate those parts. so what’s out there for me?<p>i have found one thing that works, and that’s to take drudgery work. i worked in a factory, and i didn’t mind it. my current occupation is a big step up, i make a ton more money, but it’s the same. you do the same thing over and over for hours. its enough that i can play close attention to what i need to do, but at the same time a little part of my brain can be thinking through things, solving little problems, or just dreaming up big ideas. it allows me to be me and still make the money i need. by the way, it not that i’m lazy. i’ve worked my share of long hours, both in factories during school and in my current occupation. i don’t mind the long hours as long as i don’t mind the work.<p>sorry this is so long. thank you to everyone who replies.	2008-12-10 16:25:39 UTC		6	18

373161	how much more advanced is government technology?	after seeing quantum of solace, i was reminded of a question i've wondered about for some time: how much more advanced are governments' technology (specifically the us) than tech that civilians have?<p>this comes up in a number of areas:<p>- encryption / ability to decrypt stuff<p>- computational power (supercomputers)<p>- satellite and gps granularity<p>- real-time surveillance and wiretapping<p>i've always found encryption and all that interesting, but there's always the question of whether or not the government can decrypt communications, etc. in my case, practicality has won out for the time being -- i don't worry about my generally-benign e-mails and other files stored in the cloud for instance, and the tedious nature of typing passwords each time i step to my pc, and to access my data, has yet to trump my perceived need for encryption and security.<p>i would think that if the government had some secret supercomputer capable of decrypting strongly-encrypted files, that technology would be publicly known. but with the stuff in movies about super-advanced tech, it's not an unreasonable thing to wonder about.<p>how much farther ahead is government tech than civilians? are the dazzling displays of tech in spy movies purely fantasy, or is there some element of truth to the government's secret and/or superior technical knowledge or resource?	2008-11-22 20:22:19 UTC		7	6

1180289	ask hn: modern day cs curriculum	i am currently a computer science major at a moderately well known school. the cs program concentrates heavily on java with a side of c. there is little to no mention of other styles of programming. the focus seems to be halfway between a purely theoretical approach and a purely practical approach, but at the end of the day we learn neither.<p>i seem to be here at a pretty interesting time though, because the school is currently changing the curriculum quite heavily. this put me in a fun position to try to persuade the school to go a certain direction.<p>i figured there would be tons of info online about how teaching the java api instead of core programming concepts is blasphemy, but i really can't find many good resources.<p>has anybody read a particularly interesting paper/blog/whatever that talks about different approaches/thoughts people have had regarding computer science education?	2010-03-10 05:41:56 UTC		8	5

2790358	ask hn: how big does my target market have to be?	i have an idea for a business - a service that solves a particular pain point for a well-characterized market.  the thing is that this market is not large - i would say at most a million us citizens, at least 150,000, plus perhaps a hundred thousand more worldwide. this market is currently served by a brand that is horrendous, but which is a solidly established market leader due to network effects and a freemium business model. by offering a better service, with backwards compatibility (spolsky 100% sold me on this point), i plan to disrupt and replace the current market leader. in addition to the matter of size, this is not a market with a potential for explosive growth - if i get it right, it'll have perhaps a year or two of fast growth, but will plateau into growth at single-digit percentage rates after it's soaked up market share from the current market leader. as well, this idea requires more lawyering up than the average "here is a website through which we provide a service" startup, because of concerns with user-generated content and the normal way that a startup that makes money becomes an appealing lawsuit target (this one more so than most). on the bright side, apart from retaining counsel, the business costs are perfect for the lean startup model; create the software, scale it up with ec2 and other on-demand cloud computing/storage services as needed. it's not like it's unusual, either, for a startup to live in a position of "if we get sniped by a lawsuit, we go out of business."<p>that's the background for my question - am i targeting a big enough market to seriously pitch this idea to angel investors? it's a tempting thought, because $100,000 would buy me two years of runway as a solo founder, three years if i did a good job of running lean - but because of the business model i'm targeting, i probably can't offer investors the classic startup upside of "if we win, you get a 20x or more payout." this is not a business idea that's headed for a big acquisition or an ipo - the reason that i'm not telling you the specific business idea, in fact, is not because i have a winklevossian fear of my idea being stolen, but because the idea sounds like a joke, especially in the context of an ipo or a high-octane acquisition. should i go for bootstrapping and/or friends-and-family funding? the tradeoff there is that at that level, i can't quit my job to work on this idea, and on the nights-weekends schedule, i estimate it'd take 2+ years to get the product developed, marketed, launched, and ramen-profitable. i'm a hacker: i'm greedy and impatient, and i want to be able to quit my job and work on my great idea, dammit! but i've created enough hacks in my time: i know that the ideal way to do it, sure as heck isn't the only way to do it.<p>which, in turn leads to another way to phrase the question: is this a proper startup, or is this a lifestyle business?	2011-07-21 17:24:22 UTC		10	5

- how different clothing articles should fit (including choosing clothing to match your body shape)

hello, i see you are coming from hacker news.<p>the article you clicked on was most certainly not submitted by nodejitsu.<p>news.ycombinator has a long history of squashing articles and submitters that aren't funded by y-comb.<p>most of this is done through their "silent" banning and censoring mechanisms, that leave people not even realizing they have been silenced.<p>i hope you enjoy this article, and remember that hn is extremely biased and that you should keep your horizons broad.

2350904	ask hn: would you share your story of a failed startup, please?	i am working on a new project. i think it could be of interest for the public.
it's a place where you can share your story about your failed startup. it will be a detailed review of the project from its start to its end. there is a good approach to think that there is no bad experience. you are not a loser if you have a startup that didn't pay out with money or success. you with your experience can be a more valuable professional than the one who never faced all the hurdle of developing and promoting a startup. more than that, if there are only fewer than 10% of startups take become successful, why there is so little information on the remaining 90%? together we can fill in this source providing images, statistics, interviews, images. it can then help new entrepreneurs make their decisions more wisely as well as it will make the whole image of startups life clearer.  i have almost done the design and coding of the site. i have more ideas for this site to implement when i start it. i would like to hear from you if you have your story to share. and another question to everybody - would you be interested in getting valuable information on this topic? if you would like to contact me directly, please do that over email: sergey@skible.com any ideas and suggestions are appreciated!	2011-03-21 18:14:46 UTC		20	2

451866	ask hn: why do non-techies simply not "get" the idea of a wiki?	we here at work have been trying to reduce paperwork while simultaneously increasing knowledge dissemination.  for some time the techies have been using a wiki, and others are starting to get the point that when they ask a question the first response is "have you checked on the wiki?"  the answer until recently has always been "no", and the question now is answered about half the time by doing what they should have done in the first place.<p>it's like "let me google that for you"<p>so we've moved the holiday booking system to the wiki.  now people can say when they're away on site, working from home, sick, or on leave.  the leave days can be booked in advance and then confirmed by their line manager.  at a glance we can see who is in, out, available or away, and the system is really helping our planning.  suddenly everyone knows when someone is on site and might need support, or on leave and unable to help.  the non-techies have themselves said, when shown it, that it's really useful.<p>but the non-techies just don't "get it."  they won't update the wiki, they still don't look at the wiki, they never add information to the wiki.  instead, they insist on sending things by email.  then in a few weeks time people are asking, and we have to trawl through email systems to find the information.<p>except we (the techies) don't, because when we get information we put it on the wiki.  then when the non-techies ask us anything we can say "have you checked the wiki?"<p>and they still don't get it.<p>where is the mis-match?  how can we make a wiki as accessible/understandable as a word document?<p>how can we help the non-techies attain enlightenment?<p><i>can</i> the non-techies attain enlightenment?	2009-01-27 09:37:19 UTC		39	54

8186328	ask hn: how do early startup employee equity renegotiations go?	have questions around the following scenario for an employee among the first 3 hires for founding team of a startup:
1. the initial offer for compensation &amp; equity was based on a somewhat defined role for this employee, post which the employee left comfortable corporate job to learn &amp; grow in the startup environment.(to later build their own dream)
2. a few other employees left or did not join, so this employee took on to those extra roles &amp; consequently ended up playing much more key role than initial responsibilities. this did lead to a lot of self learning, but not much of mentorship (that the employee expected initially at the startup)
3. after more than a year &amp; a first round of comfortable pre series a fund raising, it seems clear that there will be no hikes in compensation or equity given.(let&#x27;s say the naive employee expected a slight bump as a bonus proxy given the financial conditions of startup improved a lot)<p>now given this, if the employee feels that they have contributed much more &amp; handle much more responsibilities than initially expected of, &amp; the mentorship (technical or business) hasn&#x27;t been around really, is it fair to renegotiate to increase their equity?<p>if yes, what&#x27;s a fair amount to ask in general (in terms of % increases)? (there hasn&#x27;t been much transparency around the valuation on which funds were raised(even on asking) so can&#x27;t really break down equity value to numbers hence asking for generic % increase)<p>if no, then does it make more sense to
(a) rather take a leave &amp; invest these younger life years into trying out something of own
(b) go back to corporate job to gather some capital (&amp; free weekends, a few holidays) to pursue their dream later
(c) go with status quo(perhaps burnt out &amp; over-thinking stuff)
(this mid 20&#x27;s employee does like the people at this startup &amp; the problem they are trying to solve, but feels a little dissatisfied from the ratio of effort&#x2f;time being put in &amp; the expected return from this investment)	2014-08-16 14:38:32 UTC		1	0

and they convinced him to do this while carrying an anti-muslim/pro-george w. bush note, which stated his intention to rob the western union. their entire plan was spelled out on this website, dedicated to turning the tables on internet con artists (warning: contains not safe for work language).

2347784	is there a startup in my project?	i have a project that i've been weekend working since the start of the year.  and while i think it's a fine project (imho) to scratch an itch, i've always doubted its startup potential.<p>however, as they say with many eyeballs all startup ideas are shallow, i mean obvious.<p>the goal is simple, "provide an alternate means of finding a good kindle book to read."  the competition is limited to amazon itself, google books, apple ibooks, barns and noble, borders et al.  i mean, heck i've never even heard of these guys.  just a bunch of lumbering behemoth dot-com has beens.  practically shooting fish in a barrel here.<p>my "trick" is to facilitate fast, fast, fast, easy as pie browsing.  in essence, allow the customer to disposition as many books as possible in the shortest time.  way too much endless clicking around on amazon to just browse for books (product). try browsing deeper than say 100 books on amazon in the scifi genre for example.  then transition the customer onto amazon for the affiliate fee.<p>my edge is they have (thanks a bunch ms) to deal with ie 6+ while i can basically keep iterating on what would eventually be a decent alternative interface in html5 (chrome/ff/opera and god willing a maybe ie9).  at the end of the day it just needs to be a better front-end to amazon than amazon's for a decent minority of people.<p>my "secret" is a kind of math-y means for product classification and navigation, though the current project doesn't do it justice at all.  80% of effort to date is below the surface of the basic ui effort so far.<p>fwiw, i'm not limited to books, i could for example do the same for gluten free foods or some such.<p>given the dearth of quality competition in the online book retail space i thought i'd give it shot first.<p>all feedback welcome.  requires chrome.<p>http://goo.gl/tppjz	2011-03-20 23:46:18 UTC		1	0

4850715	a silly project using facial recognition	hey everyone, i'm new here and i'm looking for some feedback.<p>a friend and i came up with this idea of an app (gaydetection.com) in which you upload a photo of a person or people and it shows you which person is gay based on some facial recognition algorithm, which is the result of analyzing a lot of photos of gay people.<p>it's supposed to be hilarious, just a fun way to spend time with your friends and see who made a gay face in some photo. but i guess it can come up as being somewhat homophobic. what do you guys think? is it? i'm asking because i don't think it is, but i don't really know how a gay person would feel about this.	2012-11-29 22:38:40 UTC		1	0

2343890	stochastic optimisation in analysing efficiency of betting exchange markets	currently, my research is centred around investigating semi-strong form efficiency [1] in betting exchange markets. semi strong efficient market hypothesis says that all publicly available information about the market is reflected in the current market prices. in other words, this hypothesis claims that it is not possible to make a positive profit from a long term betting, having access to all publicly available information, including historical prices trends, traded volume, news from magazines and newspapers, scored goals and red cards in football markets, number of aces in tennis markets, and so on.<p>sometime ago, i reached a point at which my studying of betting exchange markets became complex and time consuming, consequently i decided to introduce stochastic optimisation [2] to boost performance of my research. i present, how i was analysing betting exchange markets before and after applying stochastic optimisation.	2011-03-19 16:00:10 UTC	http://blog.danmachine.com/2011/03/stochastic-optimisation-in-analysing.html	1	0

7378217	ask hn: validating an ad supported business?	i&#x27;m considering an idea for a content business which would be ad supported. there&#x27;s an awful lot of advice out there on avoiding this kind of business in favour of something where people pay you directly, but let&#x27;s say i want to consider an ad supported website as a business - how would i model &#x2f; validate it?<p>my thinking so far is that it&#x27;s a bit like the marketplace problem. on one side of the marketplace you have users of your site, and you can validate their interest by making some kind of mvp and looking at traction. on the other you have advertisers, and while you can estimate some kind of industry standard ecpm as a clearing price, the real money to be made with individual deals which aren&#x27;t really on the table until you have a certain size of user base.<p>anyone have pointers on this from past experience? anyone think it should be avoided at all costs?	2014-03-11 09:35:37 UTC		1	0

2310277	show hn: word/image game - woordplay	http://woordplay.com<p>i came up with an idea to test how people read words, and whether they can interpret meaning and quickly extract letters and form other words, then wrapped it in a game mechanic.<p>the concept might seem slightly strange, but after seeing those emails a few years back where the first and last letters are in their correct places, but the other letters are jumbled, i thought people might go for it.
you simply take the first letter of the object, colour or flag in a picture and write it down. you then do this for a string of images to form a word (players can then score points for doing this), and there are groups and leaderboards for some competition.<p>it's built on a standard rails/mysql structure, and can be used on the desktop or via a mobile web app, plus uses twitter for user sign-up/sign-in.<p>any thoughts and feedback is greatly appreciated - it's obviously still being worked on, but some pointers now will ultimately help!<p>thanks!	2011-03-10 19:08:44 UTC		1	0

http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/ab-testing-significance-calculator-spreadsheet-in-excel/<p>though in my case i started my campaign with many keywords (about 400 keywords), and i now have the following:<p>keyword group a (10 keywords - the "best"): 47 clicks, 16 conversions<p>keyword group b (390 keywords - the rest):  244 clicks, 18 conversions<p>if i apply these data into the a/b testing significance calculator, i obtain a 99% confidence that a is better than b.

6464863	facebook says taliban's page 'doesn't contain credible threat of violence'	this facebook page: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.facebook.com&#x2f;umarmedia belongs to ttp (tehreek e taliban pakistan), internationally designated terrorist organization.
this is one of the dozens of pages run by these loosly affiliated terrorist groups. they use these fb pages to spread propaganda and publish videos of their successful terror operations. i have repeatedly reported these pages, which, even when you take one look at them is obvious that they are run by terror outfits. but facebook says they are safe for families etc etc. 
just today 40 people were killed in pakistan by these people in a mosque bomb blast, earlier this week 40 were killed in a church bomb blast. a couple of weeks ago they killed a pakistani general, and duly uploaded the video on this page (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.facebook.com&#x2f;photo.php?v=224409671050680). still facebook says it does not contain credible threat of violence (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;imgur.com&#x2f;ilkxxj6). my blood is boiling with rage.
what should i do?	2013-09-29 11:35:40 UTC		1	2

7601933	ask hn: [survey] one button automatic video editing cloud service	hello hacker news,<p>i am a developer. i was wondering if any of you would be interested in an one button automatic video editing service. what you will do is upload your video on a cloud platform, and algorithms will automatically edit your videos to create interesting content for you. the key here is that this is not a tradition video editing software, and the ui will be minimal. the algorithms will automatically find the important parts of the video.<p>the assumption i have is that the current video editing software is too much hassle for everyone. let me know if i am wrong or right! thx<p>the following is a survey that will help me greatly!

599535	independent contracting & estimates	i'm in a bit of a pickle. i'm trying to generate an estimate for an app built around twitter for a regulated industry with compliance considerations. the interfaces and base functionality alone are probably 170 hours or so of work. reporting, given the nature of the auditing and compliance involved, is probably another 100+ hours. somehow i have a feeling that 270*$85usd/hour is not what this client is expecting to spend. what kind of money would you find to be "minimally acceptable" for 250+ hours of web-based and service-exposed (api to allow integration with their legacy apps) work around twitter and several other apis?	2009-05-08 12:28:18 UTC		1	2

3842887	alain delon luxury watch collection auctioned	&#60;p&#62;the auction of more than 100 &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel ceramic watches"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel ceramic watches&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; from french film actor alain delon raised an estimated $590,300 - much more than expected from the auction house cornette de saint-cyr. film icon delon, who has starred in more than 100 films over the years, has begun to sell his estate posthumously - this latest &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel replica watches"&#62;chanel j12&#60;/a&#62; watch auction was just one of several events the french film actor has held.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;an avid collector, delon had already sold off a wide collection of keepsakes from his home, including a wine collection that went for 250,412 euros. but this past &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel j12 watch"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel j12 watch&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; auction held in paris was a major attraction for the rare and extremely refined collection pieces from major brands like rolex, cartier, blancpain, audemars-piguet and vacheron.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;all of the luxurious &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com" title="chanel replica watches"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel replica watches&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62;, 100 in total, were originally put on show in hong kong before paris, the former a place where the 76 year old is still immensely popular - which attributed to much of the shocking sale prices. several chinese buyers purchased a vast variety of the legendary timepieces over the phone for well above the euro estimate, including an audemars-piguet royal oak worn in several films (&#38;quot;comme un bommerang&#38;quot;, &#38;quot;parole de flic&#38;quot; and &#38;quot;ne reveillez pas un flic qui dort&#38;quot;) for 68,750 euros - 2,500 above the euro estimate.&#60;/p&#62;
&#60;p&#62;the actor, who wasn't present at the time of the &#60;a href="http://www.chanel-j12watch.com"&#62;&#60;strong&#62;chanel j12 replica watch&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/a&#62; sale, made his film debut in 1957 and has worked with some of the world's most respected directors. as with so many actors, delon's personal life was one of controversy - the star was caught up in several scandals in the late ‘60s, though eventually all charges were dropped. though he has remained relatively under the spotlight this past two decades, delon appeared in a 2008 film &#38;quot;asteriz at the olympic games.&#38;quot;&#60;/p&#62;	2012-04-15 05:23:56 UTC	http://www.chanel-j12watch.com/chanel-ladies-watches-c-5.html	1	-1

163244	startup idea: high-volume email client	reference: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=144127<p>the more i think about this, the more i think it's a huge opportunity. i suspect there are a lot of people who are overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive, and even more who could spend a lot less time on it with a little help from their software. i suspect a few news.yc readers fall in to one of those categories. what would make things easier for you? here are a few of my ideas:<p>the fundamental problem is prioritization, preferably with a minimal amount of user intervention. who the mail is from matters, of course. what it's about may matter more. for certain types of mail, the quality of the content matters, but not for others.<p>i'm envisioning a system built around a probability-based text classifier. messages could be tagged with multiple categories. categories would get an importance weight assigned based on user behavior (time between receipt and reading, likleyhood of reply, link click or other action) with an option to manually alter the weight. some sort of autogenerated search folders would probably be useful too, but i haven't thought about the details yet.<p>is anybody else working on this?	2008-04-14 16:29:24 UTC		2	0

8760452	ask hn: ebay switched to marko templates from dust?	i thought ebay and paypal were using dust for their nodejs stack and then i came across the &quot;async fragments: rediscovering progressive html rendering with marko&quot; (see http:&#x2f;&#x2f;calendar.perfplanet.com&#x2f;2014&#x2f;async-fragments-rediscovering-progressive-html-rendering-with-marko&#x2f;) post on perfplanet. it looks like ebay is switching to a new templating language that i had not heard of called marko (see https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;raptorjs&#x2f;marko).<p>my team has been using dust for the past 3mo and have been relatively satisfied but we have ran into many limitations (poor error reporting&#x2f;debugging, issues with helpers, difficulties using the client, etc.). i have been experimenting with marko and it looks awesome (clean html syntax, async rendering, node.js module as output, to name a few...). it is kind of like angular templating, but faster and works on the server and client.<p>my questions are: are there other companies using marko? does anyone have experience using marko in their projects and, if so, what are your thoughts?	2014-12-17 00:35:42 UTC		2	0

53165	users vs. patents: what makes a successful web business?  	hi fellow tech. entrepreneurs,
there is this thing i'd like to discuss and get your feedback on.
ok, considering the last 2 biggest acquisitions within the web industry, a.k.a. myspace and youtube, nobody can deny that this business has derived to a new form: this is no longer tech. driven; this is about a company's ability to build a large user base, or let me rephrase it: this game is all about your ability to reach your targeted users and, of course, keep them. it looks like that should be the goal of any tech. founder because this is what account for dollar value, not the ip.  
this phenomenon makes other people wondering: how about the company's tech. value? how about the good old patented algorithm? are we living in a world where proprietary technology does not mean big bucks anymore? or even worse, has that become unnecessary?<p>well... one thing's for sure; neither myspace nor youtube patented anything before going online. these 2 applications were module-based meaning that their frames were already available. their "tour de force" was to articulate a smart vision and marketing strategy to reach their potential audience. on one hand myspace leveraging on its euniverse.com network to promote its service, on the other youtube mastering the art of viral marketing. as opposed to most of their competitors/copycats, they knew how to get big fast, at least faster than anybody else. in other words, implementation is much more important than technology. we can enlarge this phenomenon to non-web products: the ipod is a good example. its success is based on the same pattern; apple's people neither invented nor patented the mp3 player technology, they just came up with the smartest ui ever combined with a strong marketing campaign. <p>that's why i feel like many vcs are not in line with today's web rules; they almost always look for deep ip (the genius algorithm!!)... like being google was the only way to be successful.<p>ok, now the question is how do we get there? how do we get big fast? well... first, of course, you need to build something that people want (thanks pg), that's how you get many returning users. but also, you need to become a master at spreading the word and reaching your target! i have few ideas on the subject, but i'm far to be an expert...and this is precisely why we are applying to winter 08 funding. as many seed start-up companies, we do not need the money yc offers...actually we need something close zero dollar to get started. all we are looking for is to get in touch with this network of experts "from the valley" who know how to get it done.<p>the adventure continues...

5479040	ask hn: developing a product without a work visa	dear hn,<p>my wife and i are moving to london for a year where she's going to be a visiting scholar at a london university. i'm taking an unpaid sabbatical from my job to be with her. we are not from the usa, eu or canada.<p>my visa says "no work", which means i can't work formally and, from what i understand, can't even volunteer.<p>but i'm wondering how it applies to a less formal definition of work. could i develop products on my own (e.g. iphone apps, books) and sell over the internet? would i be in trouble if i did it? could i talk to people about problems they have that could be solved by a product and develop it? (i would be selling a product and would not be under contract).<p>what do you think? have you been in a similar situation? i'll talk to an immigration lawyer anyway and see if i can get a work permit (doubtful), but since there are people here from many countries who travel quite a bit, i thought i should ask.	2013-04-02 13:11:26 UTC		2	0

325425	ask hn: is there a state-by-state guide to ip assignment issues that affect startups?	i've been talking with some friends about doing a startup, but there's a concern about the potential ip minefield we might be encounter.  in short, one of us has a contract with a software company that makes an extremely aggressive rights grab.  according to the contract, all work done by this person, even outside of work hours and without using any company resources, becomes the property of the company.  this seems like it might be overly broad, but i'm not a lawyer and i know that the law varies considerably from state to state.<p>is there a resource somewhere online that discusses the issues in state ip/employment law for startups?  for example, i've heard that non-compete clauses are unenforceable in california, and a clause like that described above would be unenforceable in minnesota.  something like a table showing the differences would be great.<p>alternatively, since the usual response is "talk to a lawyer," can anybody recommend a competent yet affordable-enough-for-a-bootstrapped-startup attorney who could answer similar questions?  i'm particularly interested in the law for california, minnesota, and new york.  thanks!	2008-10-06 22:52:11 UTC		2	1

7464285	ask hn: moving off of google products	tl;dr: what are good replacements for various google products?  i don&#x27;t place a high value on integration, and i&#x27;m willing to use a service of lesser quality in my rebellion against big g.<p>ever since i had to add a public google+ profile to my work google apps account (which we pay for) just to use google hangouts with more than one person, i have found it increasingly hard to remain a user of google products.  i should have seen it coming from the forced youtube&#x2f;google+ upgrade, but for me the last straw was when chrome installed a desktop notification menu bar icon in os x without asking me, with no way to remove it, and no way to disable notifications for google products.  the very aggressive way that google is shoving its ecosystem down my throat is no longer palatable, and i no longer want to participate or give them my data.<p>i&#x27;ve switched off of chrome to firefox&#x2f;safari, and although they&#x27;re buggy or act in ways that are confusing (open 30 tabs in safari and figure out the rightmost tab&#x27;s behavior), they&#x27;re fine as my daily browser.<p>harder for me was to make the switch to duckduckgo as my search engine of choice, but except for google images or some trending news topic i&#x27;m mostly fine with ddg, especially now that i&#x27;m discovering lots of neat tips and tricks.<p>tonight i&#x27;m having trouble switching off of gmail to fastmail because google is flagging fastmail&#x27;s imap migration login attempts as &quot;suspicious activity,&quot; but i already think i&#x27;ll be fine with using fastmail as my new personal email provider (i don&#x27;t use my personal email that much).<p>but there are other services that i&#x27;m not sure how to replace.  google image search,  youtube, and google docs are harder for me to go off of, mostly because all-the-things are already in there and nowhere else.  any recommendations?  what about replacements for other google products?	2014-03-25 06:48:22 UTC		2	2

6160879	ask hn: how do we make more money?	do you remember back in the day when programmer salary was at an all time high? people could be making above $80,000 a year easily coding in fortran or cobol, or if you knew anything about computers, you could get a job?<p>what ever happened to this? it makes sense that as time goes on, computer literacy increases, and the demand for skilled programmers decreases. this is sadly inevitable. but what we as programmers, the skill in an age where there is not much of it, need to rise again.<p>we need to either invent a new wave of computing that makes javascript, php, web-design, java, sql, c++, and indians seem obsolete. i am not talking about making something easier that out performs, i am talking about something that is harder and much more difficult to learn. the functional paradigm, for example, would be a great way to do this. just strangle all of the conventional tutorials out of a language and make it the de facto programming language. we just need to figure out how we would do something like this: a full scale deployment to make a language like this #1.<p>if this seems bleakly infeasible, then where else can we go where the market is about to explode? where just for knowing something a little bit ahead of time, you can make a decent salary? what is going to be the next silicon valley?	2013-08-05 15:58:01 UTC		2	7

3541611	ask hn: what is my chance to find job in startups as a .net developer?	i'm new to us and a hardcore .net developer so i want to know whether there are many .net startups around or .net is mostly irrelevant in us startup community? how about in the valley?<p>the reason i ask is because i am aspired to work in startup and want to know whether i should keep developing my .net skills or start learning rails, ios, node... which seem to receive much attention from the hn community.	2012-02-02 05:41:57 UTC		2	8

2979537	ask hn: "war on talents" but startup are implementing "no vacations" policy?	apparently, we have "war on talents": startups are complaining how it is hard to recruit top talent.
however, on the other hand, many of these startups are actually offering "no vacations policy" which basically means less benefits and smaller salary (if you quit you don't get accural paid off).<p>maybe i'm naive but these two trends are not compatible from my point of view. why companies are offering less benefits while complaining that there is hard to recruit top talent?<p>who is advising these companies to do things like this? or maybe this is just a trick to target demographic of talent pool without actually saying "older than 35 need not to apply"?<p>update: re source of "no vacations policy" it is just based on unscientific survey based on interviews me and my friends had in last few months. also the latest post form balsamiq (http://blogs.balsamiq.com/team/2011/09/09/vacation-policy/)	2011-09-09 19:41:13 UTC		4	1

6003791	hyperboria(secure internet alternative) not so secure or even safe? 	lately hyperboria which is based on cjdns has been mentioned on hacker news headlines. it got me starting to research about meshnets and since hyperboria seems to be getting hyped up as the next secure internet it got me thinking if that is really true or if there are better alternatives. 
apparently cjdns uses labels in the messages sent through routers to be be tracked back and forth, which to my understanding is not so secure or anonymous. even if the message is encrypted along the way. 
i can see how the message with encryption could be breached at nodes and then backtracked to original source, or who knows how. but the fact is the chatlog i found does have some valid points as regard to cjdns being faulty advertised as secured anonymous decentralized network. apparently i2p network is more true to that and which uses a direct tunnel between two parties instead of using routes and labels traveling a long road. a lot could happen on that road...	2013-07-07 22:14:19 UTC	http://pastebin.com/gWzFwBiw	4	1

2101912	ask hn: my mvp has no name, should i wait until i can think of one to show it?	i'm coming to a point where this project that i have been working on over the past week is in an mvp-type stage. there are only a small number of changes i'd like to make before pushing it to a production server. the only problem is that i do not have a solid name, yet!<p>i'm not asking for name ideas, but i am wondering how important you all think a name is at this stage?<p>obviously, everyone's day dream is to make your review my startup post and have it get positive feedback and perhaps written about by somebody on techcrunch or any other big tech website. although it'd be a great problem to have, i'd hate to have all of this happen with me using my current domain name. i think my current one is a little too difficult to say - it doesn't quite roll off my tongue as well as i'd like. it's also a little clumsy to type. it's 8 letters, 4 syllables. it's just type words mashed together, nothing fancy. i guess my main complaint is that it's not catchy, or fun to say, or anything ... it's just bland kind of.<p>i realize i can brainstorm good names all day long, but in the end it's users that have to agree. so, the name i have may be loved or not. i don't know. but, what do you all think? should i wait until i have a solid name picked out so that i don't have to risk changing it and losing any initial tracking i may gain if i release it under this other name?	2011-01-14 00:18:21 UTC		5	11

5696556	ask hn: my dog is about to die... how can i preserve her dna??	my dog has cancer and probably won't make it through the week. i know just about everyone feels this way about their pets, but she really is an exceptional dog.<p>i would like to preserve her dna in order to keep open the possibility of cloning her some day. the majority of cloning sample preservation services require anesthesia and a biopsy, which i simply won't do to her at this point. also, for older dogs, my impression is that the skin cell samples that would be preserved might not be of a great quality.<p>to be clear, i would never dream of moving forward with existing cloning technologies. it would clearly be unethical at this stage.<p>however, i think there's a very good chance that in the coming decades the safety concerns will be resolved, and the technologies will advance to the point where a healthy clone could be created from just dna samples, and not require a biopsied skin sample.<p>so far, i've used a couple of dna banking services to keep some samples:<p>http://www.genetrackus.com/tests/dna-banking<p>http://www.vetdnacenter.com/canine-dna-banking.html<p>http://www.fluffy2.com<p>i'd like to get any knowledgeable opinions on how i might be able to preserve some viable samples on my own as a failsafe, because i'm not entirely comfortable relying on these services for a decade or more. i'm thinking some fur samples with follicles intact, sealed in airtight plastic, and maybe placed in the freezer?<p>also, just to hopefully ease one concern i might hear about, i donate generously to the humane society and other animal focused charities, and plan on donating the equivalent of whatever i spend on cloning services in the future. assuming the technology advances to where there wouldn't be any health concerns, i don't view this as anything worse than ordering a dog from a breeder.	2013-05-13 00:38:35 UTC		7	11

1774060	shady webapp business practice. opinions?	hi. i am a long time lurker. 
just as my username states, my business strategy is shady and i need your opinion on the ethics and practicality of the situation. 
i am almost done creating a webbased service which is currently being offered by 1 major competitor (2 minor ones) at a licensing fee of ~$400/group. the functionality of this service can be easily replicated for ~$10,000 and maybe $5000/yr upkeep. it is catered to niche group. the major company is making ~4-5million in profits/yr.<p>my question: is it ethical/practical for me to create the webapp and then contact the competitors in an attempt of being bought out. do companies do that?
otherwise, i would offer the service as freemium and a premium mobile app with notifications. i would directly be taking away from the competitors since they haven't updated their product since 2001 and they charge money. this is my sideproject with only myself as an employee.<p>do you contact the competition after creating the product or let the product speak for itself?	2010-10-09 01:18:38 UTC		9	4

7557634	ask hn: i am a startup employee "getting screwed" by offshore talent	i believe i&#x27;m in a unique situation and i&#x27;d like your opinion.
last year i joined a nice startup based in sv (palo alto). i joined right after the company got a seed round from a vc of 3m, with post-money valuation 12m.<p>at the time there was just the founder, and i joined together with 3 other guys (all developers). the deal for me was a bit more than 1% of incentive stock options for a 40% salary cut, with the &quot;very vague&quot; promise that the salary would have been brought to market rate at some point, if things went well.<p>now, one year later, we&#x27;re doing quite good, we&#x27;re having a bit of traction and in sv there are 3 people in the engineering department (plus some marketing guys): the founder, me and one of the other initial guys.<p>and here comes the interesting part: the rest of the dev team (~10 people) is in a foreign country with cheap cost of labor. the founder, immigrating from europe a few years ago, has maintained some very good connections with talent there: i&#x27;m telling you, those guys are good and they ask roughly 30% of what a comparable developer would ask here, and they&#x27;re happy with that.<p>i wasn&#x27;t aware of this plan originally, and now whenever i give a hint about the raise (especially lately since we might be close to another round of funding), i get the clear impression that it&#x27;s not going to happen, considering the goldmine of talent abroad that he has found, and that with my raise he could easily buy another developer for a year.<p>despite liking this job a lot, it is very hard for me to stare at what i&#x27;m losing, especially because the equity is not that great and my technical skills and managing capabilities have improved <i>a lot</i> (seriously, a dramatic improvement) during this past year, so if i changed job i might be able to easily negotiate a 20% (or more) of what i was making before joining the startup, bringing me to an effective current salary cut of more than 50%!<p>what would you do?	2014-04-09 04:26:30 UTC		10	17

1745802	ask pg/hn: questions about applying to yc	i have an idea i developed recently that i believe is fairly complicated. i would be able to implement only a prototype in the next few days before the deadline. i am in two minds - either i can apply to yc in this round with a prototype only and perhaps hurt my chances or i can apply in the next round with a reasonable "alpha" version of my idea and perhaps increase my chances.<p>what do you suggest?<p>also, do you get people who "reapply" after getting rejected and if so, how many of them make it the second time?	2010-10-01 02:54:24 UTC		15	9

238717	ask yc: would you sign this if you were me?	i was recently approached by a media agency looking to syndicate my blog's content, make it mobile friendly, find and put ads on it and revenue share with me. the term sheet is a bit daunting though. the highlights are:<p>i get 30% of adjusted gross advertising revenue.<p>"initial term is one (1) year.  then, repeated one (1) year automatic renewals, unless owner notifies [media agency] of non- 
renewal in writing.  [media agency] will have a 30-day exclusive right of first negotiation after any termination, expiration or non- 
renewal.  owner will not have discussions or negotiations with any third party until 30 days of negotiation are complete." that was initially 2 years but i got them to work it down.<p>i only get paid if my amount payable exceeds $1000.. which i think will take a long time.<p>i have to put their logo and slogan on my site.<p>"owner must ensure that factual assertions in the internet blog are true and that no content on or linked to by the 
internet blog will be obscene, pornographic, abusive, harassing, intimidating, deceitful, deceptive, offensive, or violate any 
law, or any right of any third party (including copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets), or disparage [media agency] or its products or 
services."<p>i'm a bit wary about that one as they hold me liable for what i write about.<p>"disclaimer and limitation of liability.  [media agency] makes no representation or warranties express or implied and 
disclaims any implied warranty.  in any case, [media agency]’s liability to owner will be limited to $100."<p>feedback greatly appreciated. also, is google okay with essentially duplicate content floating around elsewhere on the net? i thought this was a big no-no.	2008-07-07 15:49:06 UTC		15	29

2505144	pg hides users and increases their page loading times	for a while now i've noticed i haven't received a single reply to my posts or a single vote.  i was a little suspicious at first and gave pg/hn the benefit of the doubt, and i figured it may just have been a result of removing scores from view.  but tonight i decided to test my hypothesis and what do you know... my last 14 comments/submissions are dead and it would be safe to assume my comments are killed immediately after submitting them because i tested this too.<p>tracking back to the first dead comment... it turns out it was a comment where i defended php as a language where it was being bashed - quite frankly i've grown tired of the hate.  and my comment received a reply bashing it some more and i kindly defended it further.  is it a coincidence that all of my comments (the ones defending php as well) have been killed since then?  somehow i doubt it.<p>also interesting - i'm not sure if this is normal or not - but all of my posts do not appear dead when i'm logged in with my usual username.<p>lastly, since then... i've noticed hn has been <i>painfully</i> slow.  it takes upwards of 5 seconds to load any page on the hn site... yet everything is loading instantly through the proxy i'm using right now (and it's definitely not cached)... which tells me that my username/ip address is probably on some kind of list comprised of people who pg/hn wants to get rid of.<p>i will admit that a lot of my posts are only a few sentences long, stating my opinion, but i honestly have better things to do than write essays on a forum of which provide me no real value other than an ego stroking.  i do however have valid points to make and enjoy a small conversation or two.  i'm bringing this up because i can't think of any other reason why my posts are getting killed immediately.<p>here's a little bit of proof...<p>viewing a thread in which i've posted through a proxy: http://i.imgur.com/tedjg.png<p>viewing the same thread logged in as myself: http://i.imgur.com/ohmtk.png<p>remember, all of my submissions from that username (and i'm assuming ip as well) are killed... and loading any page takes forever.  the only explanation i can come up with is that this is some new method to rid hn of certain people.  this is obviously paul's baby and he can of course do whatever the hell he wants with it, but it's pretty uncool to waste my time by killing all my posts and delaying page loads without telling me anything is up.  (side note: i have a feeling some of you may bring up the tone of the first comment of mine (defending php) that was killed... but much worse has undoubtedly been tolerated.  so is it because i'm not following the hate-on-php herd?  i thought the whole purpose here was to promote intelligent discussion - and that certainly can't take place without opposition.)<p>edit:  i just tested the voting ability on my usual account - that also no longer works... even though, like everything else i do through my usual account, it's made to look like it's working.  this strengthens my hypothesis that this method has been implemented to slowly weed out certain users from hn in a way that they aren't aware that they're being weeded out... most likely to reduce any confrontation.	2011-05-02 04:39:24 UTC		27	4

388885	date more than one girl.	i've been working on a startup for a number of months now. if i could go back in time and give myself one piece of advice at the very beginning, this would be it:<p>always date more than one girl at the same time.<p>this is symbolic of course, and couched in terms applicable to a heterosexual male. but what i'm saying is always have multiple paths to success. always have more than one meeting lined up with a potential client or potential investor, and pursue them in parallel. (edit: to clarify, this is business advice, not technical advice.)<p>this is way better than if you pursue each one serially, and here are the two main reasons why:<p><pre><code>  - you cling to any one option less, appearing 
    less desperate, and therefore more desirable.

  - you always have something to hope for, supplying
    optimism and motivation.
</code></pre>
also, some smaller benefits:<p><pre><code>  - you drastically increase your rate of learning.

  - you can leverage work and preparation between 
    opportunities.
</code></pre>
the trick, though, is that you need to line up good, viable paths to success. you have to believe in them, otherwise the magic doesn't work.	2008-12-07 14:38:38 UTC		63	51

9246234	ask hn: remote product/company vision discussion	hey hn<p>i am one of 4 cofounders of our company.<p>i am (very) remote, working from the other side of the planet due to a variety of circumstances. recently, we&#x27;re having a divergence of opinion on where we should take our product -- our ceo (who&#x27;s not the product lead) wants to play it safe and be incrementally better than the competition, while i want to play to our core competencies and design a fresh experience from the ground up that is more true to the founding principles of our company.<p>the most important issue is that 4-way videoconferencing has proven to be extremely taxing for me to carry out design and vision discussions -- i&#x27;m usually starting the meeting at 3am and we can&#x27;t get anything done unless we talk for at least 2-3 hours. it&#x27;s tiring sitting in one spot with headphones on staring into a webcam looking at lo-res feeds of my teammates till dawn. it also doesn&#x27;t seem even 10% as productive as an in-person team hands-on meeting of the same length, further adding to my frustration.<p>how do other remote cofounders or product vision&#x2f;designers go about dealing with macro-level disagreements?<p>i didn&#x27;t want to be too verbose here, longer description in pastebin link:<p>pastebin.com&#x2f;wqyxcl1t	2015-03-22 10:12:19 UTC		1	0

the wrote to me this morning saying urgent: all free backify accounts will be closed on november 22, 2011
so i paid for an upgrade.
then livedrive wrote to me saying backify are no longer a reseller and their users should get their payment transaction cancelled.
livedrive said:

i&#x27;m looking for a platform where the site is fully static on the server, but includes a javascript client cms or something similar that authenticates to ftp on the server and edits files. in this way the site could be hosted on neocities, cheap static hosting, etc... without needing to be managed from a desktop app or command line. similar to webhook but without the external build and database.<p>i&#x27;m considering building something along these lines but i&#x27;m wondering if it already exists.	2014-06-16 16:55:41 UTC		1	0

3131024	startup valuation	hi everyone,
a hacker pal in davos said $0.4 should be the cheapest software-based advert to sell in any software industry. since most or all startups are close to nothing for a value starting out, i felt that figure should be good enough for naming an original purchase price for a startup stock.<p>so here's my math for what an angel gets for investing $2,000 in a startup if the number of nominal shares before outside investment was 30,000 for example:<p>2,000 / 0.4 = 5,000 shares<p>5,000 + 30,000 = 35, 000 (the new stock of nominal shares)<p>5,000 / 35, 000 = 0.14 (approx.)<p>so the angel gets 14%.<p>just wondering if we could attach the value of a startup stock to a software product of the cheapest rate. i'm out on your take. what do you think please?	2011-10-19 17:04:43 UTC		1	0

5245122	ask hn: how much of your old code do you keep?	i have archives of a few hundred projects, in various states of completion, from over the years. there are plenty more that i never saved, too. i'm curious how many of you do this as well, and if you have any fond memories that you would like to share.<p>it is interesting sometimes to go back through and see how poorly our even occasionally how well i did things. i know i've kept them this long because i always felt like i was going to finish them. i'm actually working through some of the more complete ones. one of the projects i've been iterating and using as an orm system for every for-pay project i've worked on on the last 6 or 7 years. the nice thing about reinventing a wheel is that you know everything about that wheel. it has gotten powerful enough that it is a real time saver far beyond what i could have imagined when i first started it.<p>i wish i had saved this joke code translator from college. it would define a mapping between basically gibberish and c expressions. i used it to make programs that looked like they had been written by monotonic cartoon characters: south park's timmy and pokemon's pikachu. i don't even know why i did the pikachu one, because i never had an interest in pokemon. it would be a good laugh to have it around still, but i think it would lose something to rewrite it today.<p>i have a text mode simulation of fish in a tank that i occasionally tinker with. actually, it has a gui and ascii-art mode as well. but i like the text adventure style mode the best, just for the shear absurdity of typing "clean fish poo".<p>anyway, not going to drone on about all of them. please, share your own stories.	2013-02-19 16:28:17 UTC		1	0

701919	new online community creates opportunity for small businesses in a bad economy	as the economy continues to sputter, local small businesses continue to search for new and better ways to bring in new customers and clients. but, in a world where every consumer is looking for a bargain - a great deal, a nice discount. but, for many, reaching those bargain-hunters directly through paid advertising is financially impossible. the results for many small businesses have been ugly.<p>according to small business lending analyst robert coleman, in 2008, small business defaults on small business administration (sba) loans reached 12 percent, up from just 2.4 percent in 2004.<p>even with thousands of websites catering to all sorts of people, there hasn't been a "one stop shop" where a small, independent businesses owner can offer these deals for consumers in their area to find them.<p>where others might see gloom and doom, jan stuart saw hope and opportunity. an entrepreneur who saw his own successful business go under due to the stock market crash in 1987, stuart has launched a new project, jansdeals.com, which specifically caters to the new deal-seekers who increasingly use the internet, and allows small businesses to cheaply target them, by listing deals that they can edit and change as they see fit.<p>"i really sympathized with the small business owners, because i've been there," said stuart, who is offering small businesses three months free listings on the website to help launch the site. "you've got the big stores like macy's which can afford to buy a full-page ad, offering 30 percent off all handbags. but what about the handbag shop down the street, or the woman who sells hand-made bags from a small home-based business? how can they say, 'hey, i got a good deal here too!'? there was nothing for them - not even on the internet. that's why i created jan's deals."<p>indeed, online marketing has been very much untapped by small businesses. 220 million+ people have internet access, according to nielsen. but, more than half of all small business owners aren't using the internet to market or advertise their business, according to american express.<p>those who hadn't used the internet for advertising, and took part in a limited test phase of jan's deals in boca raton, fla.,. seemed pleased with the results. stuart's site includes testimonials from local businesses praising the concept.<p>"i do a lot of advertising in news print and on the web, but since signing up with jan's deals i have never had such a consistent flow of new patient's from one source," writes the owner of siegel chiropractic center.<p>reaction like that is what stuart believes will be replicated nationwide, as more businesses find his site and sign up.<p>"americans are desperate for deals, because they have to stretch every dollar. but, at the same time, they want to help their locally owned small businesses, because everyone knows the horrible effect small businesses failing has on the local economy. marrying those two things together at a website like this will absolutely take off," said stuart. "someone just had to create it."	2009-07-13 15:42:57 UTC		1	0

8574818	ask hn: what do you think about the “glass cage” book of n. carr?	 i should like to know what people here think about this book. there was something similar,  1985 book: the silicon idol: the micro revolution and its social implications.<p>what i really think is that we haven&#x27;t yet started to understand the kind of higher older problems that we may have to cope with, there known unkowns and unknown unkowns, and i think we are in the quadrant in which unexpected things can happen, but as always we will try to seek solutions in our comfortable zone.  i haven&#x27;t read the book, only some  fragments on the web.<p>perhaps someone can add some good opinion about this. for example the concept of taleb about resiliance and how systems should be designed to fail, and how our models don&#x27;t take into account the real risk and the black swam of the future.  it seems to me that the author is not a computer scientist or a mathematician and so some concepts maybe lacking that others could read in the design of systems. just as an example i found this in carr blog, http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.roughtype.com&#x2f;?p=1610 (from 2012):<p>carr: i don’t fully understand this excerpt from nassim nicholas taleb’s forthcoming book antifragile, but i found this bit to be intriguing:<p>john cook (famous blogger on math and stats) tries to explain a statistical fact from this fragment of taleb that carr find difficult to grasp. that was the type of limitation i was thinking could happen, some ideas only can be grasped when you are ready for them.<p>edited: added references to taleb, resiliance and risk, and john cook.	2014-11-07 21:49:00 UTC		1	0

124892	vc fundraising manual: convertible debt: delaying valuation	convertible debt is a valuable tool, especially for very early stage startups. this financial arrangement enables an investor to invest money in your company without negotiating a valuation for your company. these contracts enable the debt to convert to equity when the next round of capital is raised at a specified value. essentially, convertible debt enables seed investors to leave the valuation work to the next investors.<p>this can be very helpful for seed stage investments as it can be disadvantageous to set a valuation of the company before the first professional investor gets involved. for example, if the seed stage investors invest at a much higher valuation than the professional investors are willing to do in the series a, there can be...<p>more @ www.markpeterdavis.com	2008-02-27 18:30:18 UTC	http://www.markpeterdavis.com/getventure/2008/02/convertible-deb.html	2	0

i&#x27;m trying to realize a plugin that combines samples based on pseudorandomly created patterns.
we&#x27;ve decided to try going the vst route but have no experience with it.
since i&#x27;m not super familiar with c++ i just wanna find out if there are other ways to vsts than the steinberg sdk or juce, maybe python or java wrappers that work?
there&#x27;s pyvst but it seems not to be maintained.<p>glad for any input, have a good one.	2015-05-22 09:08:36 UTC		2	1

we've pushed a new activity stream (aka wall) to wishberg. we had set a very high benchmark for this - build something better than facebook's wall, or at least match it in worst case.<p>here is what we have intended - a. ability to discover interesting wishes &#38; experiences. b. discover new interactions - like / comments / reviews / requests / thanks / follow c. for new users - guide them towards power users whom they can follow based on interests. d. analyze mutual relationships and suggest interactions of people whom they might be knowing but not following each other on wishberg.<p>we don't have tons of data like facebook, good number of users and it was a product challenge to build something like this. do let me know your feedback and how we fared.<p>post on blog: http://blog.wishberg.com/re-inventing-the-activity-stream-on-wishberg	2013-01-31 10:41:54 UTC		3	0

85350	understanding monads in one minute	well, not really, but maybe this will give some intuition?<p>it's all about function composition.<p>if you have<p><pre><code>  f: a -&#62; b
  g: b -&#62; c
</code></pre>
then you can easily compose these functions: a =&#62; g(f(a))<p>however, if you want to associate extra information along with the
function result (e.g., a none flag in option[int] say), we would have:<p><pre><code>  f: a -&#62; m b
  g: b -&#62; m c
</code></pre>
to compose f and g, we can no longer use a =&#62; g(f(a)) because f(a) has
type m b but g requires a b.<p>instead, we can use a &#62;&#62;= bind operator to compose these functions as follows:<p><pre><code>  a =&#62; ( f(a) &#62;&#62;= g ) where &#62;&#62;= has type m b-&#62;(b-&#62;m c)-&#62;m c
</code></pre>
returning to our option example:<p><pre><code>  f:a -&#62; option[b]
  g:b -&#62; option[c]
</code></pre>
&#62;&#62;= has type option[b] -&#62; (b-&#62;option[c]) -&#62; option[c]<p>we can define it like this:<p><pre><code>  &#62;&#62;=( option_b : option[b], g:b=&#62;option[c] ):option[c] = {
       if ( option_b.none_flag set ) return option[c] with none_flag set
       return g(option_b.value)
  }</code></pre>	2007-12-02 04:24:44 UTC		3	2

2256526	ask hn: stop ex-boyfriend from seoing my sister to death	my sister's ex-boyfriend bought her a domain name and built her a web site a few years ago.  they broke up last year.  now he wants thousands of dollars for his work on her web site.  she's trying to move on.  she got a new domain name and built a new site.<p>he seems to still be doing active seo so her old domain name appears first in search results.  and the old domain has a page with just her name.  no content.  the old domain is her name, firstlast.com, and has been around
for 3 or 4 years.  is she screwed?  is it possible to get her new domain which has actual content about her to do better?<p>thanks!	2011-02-24 01:01:04 UTC		3	4

5800260	ask hn: are startups biased towards devs from finance?	i'm a software developer working on software for banks in london. i graduated in december last year. i've got 2 internships (one of top 5 inv. banks and engineering company). i've got a few opensource projects (github, codeplex) and substantial web presence (stackoverflow, blog, coderwall). almost everyday i hack something for fun(phone app, webapp on aws). i do my codekata, recently in scala and yet i don't know how to land a job in a startup.<p>i always wanted work in a startup. the tipping point was when i was working on a imagine cup project with friends. i really enjoyed that experience. even after all-night coding i felt happy and productive. i struggled if this is right for me. maybe it was the influence of environment that having a job is the right way? i don't know, but finally i know what i want to do in my life.<p>i tried to pitch a few startup, but no interview invite. is my lack of startup experience a problem (chicken or egg dilemma)? maybe working in finance is not hot?	2013-05-31 18:13:23 UTC		3	6

8362317	ask hn: does android-development-as-a-service make sense to you?	my question: would it make sense to offer android as a service?<p>startups&#x2f;businesses often don&#x27;t do android apps, but your audience likely is on android. so i&#x27;m exploring this idea of doing android as a service.<p>we would design + build + maintain your android app, as a copy (but adjusted for android) of your ios app. the important bit is: it would be just as good, not a crappy android copy but an android app that feels android-y and has a great ux.<p>doing this as a subscription service (not a project-based consulting service) would (?) make it much cheaper for you. and it would also mean your android app continues to get love and polish after launch, which is what you&#x27;d want. you&#x27;d sign up for ongoing development at a fixed monthly price, and you could cancel anytime.<p>i am looking for startups&#x2f;businesses that have an ios app but not an android app and that think having a great android app without tons of distractions, and at reasonable cost, could help them grow significantly.<p>i want to discuss this idea. it may well be dumb (feel free to criticize in the comments). i&#x27;m probably missing a bunch of things.<p>i wrote down some more detailed thoughts on a landing page here:

5497412	ask hn: strategies for converting 1m line enterprise system to new language.	we have a million+ line system (accounts, order, stock, etc) that's written in a programming language that's creaking a bit at the edges. i mean, it's old. every time we consider rewriting it in a new language, the scale of the task puts us right off. as a consequence, we're still coding using a programming language from the 1980's and new features take four to five times longer than they should to develop. it's hugely frustrating.&#60;p&#62;what strategies, stories and advice do people on hacker news have for coping with this increasingly difficult situation? how did you reboot? anyone been through the same and come out the other side stronger?&#60;p&#62;#i've not identified the language we're using because it's a small community and i don't want to be identified.	2013-04-05 09:23:21 UTC		4	7

948693	ask yc: ideas for fluiddb?	fluiddb is a centralized but scalable datastore.  in it, the meaning of a given object is derived from the tags placed upon it-- and any user can place namespaced tags on any object.  the idea is that ad-hoc standards for object ids and tag names will emerge through use.  i think this is a pretty novel shared-data concept and have had a couple ideas for it, but i'm sure news.yc will have additional novel applications. (i am a fan of fluiddb and its creator, but am otherwise unaffiliated.)<p>what interesting apps can you imagine with this shared-data system?<p>you can get a high-level idea of it here: http://abouttag.blogspot.com/2009/08/guardian-1000-novels-everyone-must-read.html<p>you can get into the details here: http://doc.fluidinfo.com/fluiddb/	2009-11-18 17:59:11 UTC		7	6

5595676	ask hn: parents of 2 month old baby. going nuts with stress	i never thought i will ask hn for this but since this place is awesome in terms of advice on life events, i have decided to share my story. i hope that this post does not come as attention seeking or anything like that. i genuinely want to hear your opinions on our case.<p>so basically we just became proud and happy parents of a baby girl and she is just about 2 months old. perfectly healthy baby and everything that <i>matters</i> is in good shape. now, i understand that becoming a parent with a newborn is challenging and i am not expecting an easy way out but the stress has been phenomenal. we kind of planned things but were sloppy here and there and suddenly find us in a lot of stress. we have family support around us but they cannot be there every day including the nights which are toughest.  our baby wakes up every 3 hours on average for milk and her mother is pumping milk. we are facing difficult nights and even though my wife is still in her maternity leave, i have to go to work and leave our house latest by 7:30 am. we tried babysitter to help out but it did not turn out well (not the focus of this post). last night, my wife was almost yelling at the baby because she won't drink the milk and it was really frustrating. this needs to change.<p>our own relationship (wife and i) seems shaky suddenly and she has started resenting me. i don't know if it is temporary but it is not pretty. i am trying to be patient with her thinking it could be the hormones etc. but every other day, there is something new that she blames me for. i m not taking it personally but it is hard.<p>question is: other than family support, google (babycenter.com etc.), what else can we do to figure things out better ? i am sure there are many experienced parents on hn and any advice for dealing with a newborn will be useful. i just seem to be lost right now even though i am usually a very confident and "i know what i am doing" kind of person. not in this case :( wife does not even know i am posting on hn.	2013-04-23 15:24:11 UTC		9	40

3225109	ask hn :join a startup vs amazon in india? 	i am a lurker here since a couple of years and i am in need of some advice. i have 5 years of exp in java dev at a couple of big companies. i need to select between the following two options<p>1. smallish startup in bangalore that is doing reasonably well. they have &#60;50 ppl on the the tech side. they are offering around 15 lakhs with a 20% variable pay included in it.
2. software development engineer in test at amazon, chennai. i would be working on test frameworks and automating test cases. the pay is almost 20 lakhs i've experessed my concern of wanting to work on dev and not qa. the hr has told me that i can move into a sde role after a year and relocate to any amazon office after 18 months.<p>i personally want to take up the first option since i'd get out of chennai and working for a startup will be more fulfilling.
i don't really enjoy testing and would be stuck in chennai, but working at amazon would improve my profile and could get me a chance to get to sv in a couple of years.<p>my dream like many of us here is to start a startup.<p>i know that it is ultimately me that has to make a call based on my priorities but i am finding it very difficult and some perspective could help.	2011-11-11 16:33:10 UTC		11	11

3102365	details on the german government malware's applications	the german (more specifically bavarian) newspaper "süddeutsche zeitung" (sz) reports details of investigations where the "bundestrojaner" (government malware) was actually used in bavaria.[1] i could not find a similar source in english so allow me to summarize.<p>some background first: the malware's initial purpose and intention was to provide means of wire-tapping otherwise encrypted communications (skype, https etc.) by listening in right at the source. so, basically they would install the malware on your pc either by covertly entering your home or e.g. while checking your laptop at the airport. needless to say, these actions are very grave invasions of your privacy, thus the premise for the bundestrojaner always was: authorities are only allowed to use this in cases of very serious crime and to counter very serious threats - needless to say, it was sold as a means to prevent against terrorism. and it was stated very clearly that it is only allowed to do wire-tapping and technical measures must prevent the software from doing anything else! the ccc's analysis of the malware a few days ago[2] showed that it goes far beyond that and even offers means of accessing your hard disk and loading additional modules once it has been installed on your system - and that this functionality was intentionally obfuscated in the machine code, so whoever developed that thing clearly knew what they were developing was very illegal.<p>so, the sz reports 5 cases in bavaria in which the bundestrojaner was used and not a single one of them qualifies as "serious crime", rather they were fighting petty crooks and scammers:<p>in one case, they could not get sufficient evidence against a group illegally selling pharmaceutical products and narcotics but the malware (unlawfully!) yielded them 60.000 screenshots - this is the same laptop that the suspect's lawyer then gave to the ccc for analyzing.<p>in the second case, they used the malware against a group of online scammers selling electrical appliances which they would then not deliver but take your money. they are suspected to have scammed around 120.000 people for around 10 million euros. the malware was installed by covertly gaining physical access to one of their systems. (the shocking amount of victims aside, this is still petty crime.)<p>in another case, authorities used the malware to crack down on a group of fences who stole clothes and hygiene products and sold them overseas. they took screenshots but ultimately couldn't make a successful case against the group in court.<p>in the last case in sz's article, they installed the malware remotely to monitor a man selling doping to bouncers. he has a prior record of theft and scamming and was sentenced to four years.<p>sz goes on to sum up a few more instances in other german states where the malware was used, again just to monitor organized crime and organized drug-related crime.<p>so, clearly none of the cases qualify as very severe crime. according to sz, the german federal office of criminal investigation (bka) rejected an early version of the malware specifically for the reason that it offered means of taking screenshots and allowing access to the hard disk; a later version that only offered wire-tapping was found usable, though. the malware found and analyzed by ccc is said to be that older version, according to its maker digitask.<p>i, for one, am going to put my tin foil beanie back on and switch to a more obscure os and architecture combination - and on a more serious note, i feel let down by how unprofessional and downright clueless the government over here handles pretty much all technology related matters. we need stronger pirates more than ever.<p>[1] http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/spaeh-affaere-wie-bayern-mit-dem-trojaner-kleinkriminelle-jagte-1.1159712<p>[1] (google translate) http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&#38;tl=en&#38;js=n&#38;prev=_t&#38;hl=en&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;layout=2&#38;eotf=1&#38;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2fdigital%2fspaeh-affaere-wie-bayern-mit-dem-trojaner-kleinkriminelle-jagte-1.1159712<p>[2] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3088687	2011-10-12 10:38:04 UTC		12	3

3996966	ask hn: startup opportunities in bioinformatics	i'm a first-year computer science phd student currently working in optimization and machine learning. for my phd, i have a long-term goal of building a commercializable piece of technology (an algorithm, a piece of software, etc.) and hopefully turn it into a company. one potential area for this that seems exciting is bioinformatics. i was wondering if anyone here had any insight into developing bioinformatics technologies and turning them into a startup. is bioinformatics a good field for this? are there any examples of comp. bio. technologies that have been successfully commercialized?<p>right now, most bioinformatics research that i see in universities seems to be more on the pure science side. i feel like in this kind of research, progress is extremely incremental, and one individual's work will have a noticeable impact only within a small community of academics.<p>also, let me know if there are other promising areas besides bioinformatics that i should consider for what i would like to do.<p>thank you!	2012-05-19 20:24:25 UTC		12	5

4204977	how to bootstrap in the valley/san francisco for 3 months	me and my startup co-founder are planning a 3 month business trip to the states where we are going to live in the valley and/or san francisco. we are from denmark and of cause want to get as much out of the trip as possible.<p>we are both in our 30's with a couple of startups behind us already. we are outgoing and would love to meetup with fellow hackers and entrepreneurs.<p>we have a place to stay in palo alto for the first week or so and we have a few friends in the valley in other startups that we hope(!) can set us up with desks for some of the time. but we are also more than willing to get to know new people, work from cafes etc.<p>the official purpose of the trip is to network, bootstrap and ultimately meet with a lot of investors to pitch our project.<p>i'm writing here in hopes of getting some good advice of how to survive 3 months in the valley or san francisco. i of cause have a huge amount of questions, and i bet you can tell me stuff i didn't know i needed to know. but to get the started here are my most burning questions:<p>- where should we go to meet and hang out with other cool startups?
- how do we get internet?
- how do we get sims without a contract for our iphones and ipads?
- do you know of a friendly startup with one or two extra desks that we can use for a limited time?
- how do we get around cheaply (transport)?
- and of cause, do you have a spare bed or couch? ;)	2012-07-05 21:09:07 UTC		12	20

1185887	ask hn: what's actually "defendable" about web startups these days?	for example, what's keeps gowalla from copying foursquare's features, and vice versa? unless a startup is working on something truly revolutionary and highly technical, how would a startup answer the question: what's keeping competitor x from copying you?<p>the lack of an ip warchest for today's startups seems to me like a glaring weakness. and you can't answer with "our team", "the way we execute", etc. i mean something that's <i>truly</i> defendable. (i guess facebook did patent the news feed...)<p>just something i've been thinking about lately, but have yet to find a satisfying answer for and thought i'd ask the hn crowd. thanks!	2010-03-12 05:42:11 UTC		16	13
881134	ask hn: how do i find a marketing person for my startup?	i'm on the verge of releasing the second version of an iphone app as well as deploying several new features to bouldr, however, i realize that the features themselves are not going to turn my site into a success.<p>my question is: should i get a dedicated marketing persion on board, and if so, how should i go about finding and selecting them?<p><i>edit (in reponse to revorad)</i><p>a little more detail:<p>bouldr (http://bouldr.net) is a worldwide guidebook for rock climbers and boulderers.<p>i'm in the process of building an iphone application, and have released the first version already this year. from that, i drew on feedback, and have made numberous improvements and changes. the next version is just about ready, and once the last bug is smashed into the ground, i'll be submitting it for review.<p>i'll be building a free version of the app too - i'm building the paid version first so that i can get feedback from people that are genuinly interested in having bouldr on their iphone.<p>ideally, i need to get lots more people adding and updating the site, and in order to do so, i think i need help from someone with the experience necessary to carry through.<p>i have a facebook fan page (http://facebook.com/bouldr), with ~14k fans, so i think i'm doing something right, but i also suspect that the message i'm sending is confused or at least not consise enough to stick.	2009-10-14 12:01:28 UTC		16	26

4306717	show hn: moodtrack, a simple iphone app to track your moods and thoughts	i've often wondered whether there are any patterns or cycles to my moods so i built a simple iphone app that occasionally pings me to ask how i'm feeling on a scale of 1 - 10. i also note down what i'm thinking or doing at that moment and automatically grab my location. i use the data to show some basic statistics on how i've been feeling on average over the past three days, past week and since i started tracking. there's also a graph of my moods over time.<p>i'd love to get feedback on whether people would find something like this useful. i'm curious about what other things people would want to track about themselves and interesting things to do with the data.<p>http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moodtrack/id541505268?mt=8	2012-07-28 22:22:56 UTC		43	29

1743013	ask hn:  please help a virgin blogger.	after repeated requests, i finally started a blog, but i have no idea what i'm doing.  for me, commenting here at hn comes naturally but blogging doesn't.  i'm so busy i don't have time, so i did the next best thing; i am "recycling" my old hacker news comments.  it only takes about 5 minutes each morning.<p>i don't have the most important thing i advise my customers: a goal.  i'm not looking to drive traffic, make money, or get business.  i do want to paint a picture of myself and my work and provide whatever value i can.  i have included a link to my blog both here on my profile and as the last line of every email i send.<p>http://shleppingdata.com<p>after a few months, i'm wondering if i should continue.  is this a waste of time, or does it provide value and can it lead to something else?<p>1. no one has ever commented, so i just turned comments off.  does this make sense or just seem lame?  maybe they don't comment because it's recycled material.<p>2. posterous allows up to 100 entries per screen, so i just set mine at the max.  it's only text and almost everyone should have broadband by now, so it loads fast.  why would anyone set this lower?<p>3. posterous allows tags, presumably to group similar posts, but i can't find any facility for an index or table of contents.  so i just tag every post with it's own title.  again, does this make sense or does it just seem lame?<p>4. i named my blog "shlepping data", because the simplest explanation of what i do is "shlepp ones and zeroes from point a to point b".  (of course there are a lot of details and i'm spending a lifetime mastering them.)  i wanted to leave a touch of lightheartedness along with all the technical talk.  cool or lame?<p>5. any other suggestions from seasoned bloggers are greatly appreciated.  what else could provide value without investing too much time?	2010-09-30 12:15:24 UTC		58	35

3048006	ask hn: has anybody here ever successfully started a videogame company?	i think most of the honest people here 30 or younger will say they got into programming in some part due to videogames.  these days, it seems more viable than it used to, with the various routes for self-publishing available through the xbox live marketplace and the app markets.<p>after seven years of doing much less interesting varieties of programming at work while making silly js games at home - my urge to actually make videogames is stronger now than ever.  so, i took action.  i downloaded the xna toolkit and banged out a basic pong clone in an hour to start off with and moved forward from there.  coincidentally i happen to be friends with an amazing musician who was more than happy to provide me with music and a great artist to provide me with graphics.  fast forward to today and i've got a game that i can feasibly see myself releasing this week.<p>i want to keep doing this and would love if i could start doing it full time; it's been a blast.  i'd like to do this full time but like most people, i'm not independently wealthy quite yet.  i still have to feed myself.  so, all of that is to say, has anyone here tackled the same endeavor and succeeded?  are there people who fund games other than the big successful videogame companies perpetuating themselves or does everyone find success on the side then keep going?  certain platforms sell better than others (i've heard steam's much better than the xbox 360 market)?  any hurdles to watch out for?	2011-09-28 14:33:39 UTC		84	51

2915404	no clear exit	let me begin by saying that i have been actively reading and sourcing y combinator for the last year and am extremely grateful for the community. the articles and information are thought provoking and inspirational. that said, i am not a programmer and thus have never posted.<p>however, i find myself "stuck" and wanted to get some feedback from the group. i have been in the financial services industry for the last twenty years and need to transition out of it and into something that would link my passion to my profession. however, unlike most of you here, i don't necessarily know what that might be. i have taken two non-paid "sabbaticals", if that's what you call getting laid-off and choosing to not continue in your profession but instead take the time to explore other options, however, none of the other options provided a legitimate means of making a stable income that would provide a true transition out of my current field.<p>i have twice before started partnerships, however, most of my newer ideas would require some tech experience of which i have none. i have though of perhaps doing some part-time work for others as a means of starting to move to another field, however, with a regular full-time job it's difficult. thoughts of possible part-time or remote working with my current employer are for naught as i work in a very old and established industry that does not support remote or part-time hours.<p>so, i find myself here typing away at a starbucks at 10pm looking for wisdom and inspiration from others who may have found themselves in this same situation and found a way to transition successfully to a new occupation that more aligns their passion to a profession.<p>thanks again for providing a forum where i can post!<p>have a good day.	2011-08-23 04:59:08 UTC		2	5

5552018	update to my japanese study game for ios, kanaswirl	i've been working on my japanese learning game for the past year. i love anki but it's kinda vanilla and once your reviews for the day are done there's not much you can do to continue studying with it. so i made kanaswirl which is what i wished existed when i started learning japanese four years ago. because i learned the kana by just writing them down a lot. booorrring.<p>so please, check out kanaswirl in the app store:<p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kanaswirl/id525332301<p>the changes in this version are:<p>★ selectively study only hiragana or only katakana (suggested by daniel)<p>★ tweak accuracy coloring (suggested by daniel (he's on fire!))<p>★ i love my shiny new icon. i hope you do too!<p>★ kanaswirl is now 25% smaller. that's almost another photo's worth!<p>★ starts up a little bit faster too :)<p>★ you now get katakana as well in the start screen swirl. ナイス！<p>please let me know what you think!	2013-04-15 15:32:57 UTC		1	0

219303	ask yc:  six year old proposes new number	my son is six years old, and interested in big numbers.<p>we just read a book about big numbers, where we learned that a mathematician's nephew named the number "googol" when the mathematician wrote out a number with 100 zeroes for him.<p>my son, inspired by this story, wants to propose his own number:<p>quadrupillion<p>he has defined this number as "one hundred more than googolplex."<p>i thought this forum might be a good place to get feedback for him. what do you think of his proposal?<p>here is your chance to have an influence on a potential hacker of the future. :)	2008-06-17 01:43:15 UTC		14	89

2258796	ask hn: can we assemble a business from components yet?	in the old days, it seemed that every company wrote their own inventory control system, accounting system etc in-house, to cope with their specific business: their processes, their data etc.<p>then, companies began to customize solutions, such as sap.<p>now, it seems that many webapp companies can get started by stitching together services, for the generic business stuff - things like payments, user-interface forms, forums etc. note: i don't mean assembling the <i>product</i> (or service) - what the business actually does to create value - but all the standard generic "business" stuff.<p>how easy is it to assemble these services?  is there quite a bit of work in the actual stitching together (gluing/interoperating), or is that pretty straightforward? are there gaps in what services you need, that you'd think really should be generic?<p>in the bigger picture, if we truly are at the point of plug-and-play business-creation, it would enable an even greater explosion in businesses exploring niches to fill, how to reach customers, and experimenting with different ways to solve each of the "real" problems.	2011-02-24 17:16:58 UTC		7	2

5409706	ask hn: what should be my hourly compensation? what is yours?	i've been working as freelance web designer/developer in an asian country. i primarily get projects through referrals. my current clients have very low budgets. since, small businesses here are not comfortable with variable (hourly) pricing. i've been doing fixed rate projects only.<p>i consider myself decent at front end design, front end coding and ruby on rails. i have few finished rails applications i've developed, which i haven't hosted because i don't have a server with good rails support.<p>enough about my background. now i get approached by people from countries like us for freelancing, after checking my github or stackoverflow profile.<p>now, since i haven't worked on hourly rate basis, and i'm working for incredibly low price for clients here(recently finished an ecommerce website design and front end coding for $300). i don't know what should be my hourly compensation in respect to the work i deliver.<p>so, i seek you guys/gals help. what should be my hourly rate for doing rails work? and for doing front end coding?<p>if you are comfortable, please share your hourly compensation and some insights regarding this subject matter.<p>thanks	2013-03-20 19:47:55 UTC		3	7

742258	ask hn: small fish v. big fish - exclusivity contract?	executive summary: small bootstrapped startup, approaching potential b2b clients about the product we want to build.  one established company wants to help us build it, in return for an exclusivity deal.  what are the gotchas?  how do we avoid getting screwed?<p>long version:<p>my partner and i want to bring a new technology (mobile devices) to an existing industry which currently isn't using it, but we believe definitely will be using it in a few years' time.  we've spent the last month knocking on doors, trying to gauge interest, and to define what shape a solution might take - basically, doing customer discovery.  there is definitely interest, the industry feels that the times are changing, but isn't exactly sure how that change will happen, and enthusiasm has varied wildly between different companies.<p>my partner and i are both tech people, and we have very limited domain knowledge - we're learning and making contacts as we go, but we started from zero a couple months ago.  we're also trying to bootstrap as far as possible.<p>i had a meeting today with the first company that was truly enthusiastic about what we're proposing.    they "got it" right away, and proposed a partnership to build the solution we have in mind.    they are willing to bring their expertise and domain knowledge to the table (they've been around for 15 years), but in return, they want some form of (time-limited) exclusivity.  they are basically seeing the same opportunity we are seeing, and want to use it to grow and position themselves as a leader - and are happy to work with us as partners, but (naturally) not as competitors.<p>depending on the terms of the agreement (we'd want a good lawyer on our side, of course), there could be significant upsides.  they would effectively become our first (large) client.  we could use their expertise to build a product that makes sense, and their reputation and sales channels to push it into the market - these are certainly not our strengths.  our interests would be aligned in the sense that they would want to push as many sales as possible - thus growing both our businesses.<p>the part i'm nervous about is:  we're a two-person startup with no funding, they're an established midsize company.  how do we make sure we don't get screwed?<p>what are the downsides and hidden gotchas to something like this?	2009-08-04 21:36:11 UTC		4	8

2611042	verpakken is gevaarlijk	verpakken is tegenwoordig erg moeilijk geworden voor grafische handafwerkers 
machines nemen nu de hand over en mensen zitten nu in de problemen door dit soort zaken 
dus bepaalde bedrijven moeten zich echt gaan richten op dat gene waar het meeste geld in zit 
automatisatie is niet altijd gunstig dus.
verpakken is een psychologie voor de mens.
het brengt een zekerheid van hygiëne en de zekerheid dat iets niet kan bederven.
dat het niet stuk kan gaan dat het geheel in de omvang van de verpakking blijft
mensen zijn gauw geneigd de verpakking snel eraf te halen als het product geconsumeerd moet worden.
doordat het product te snel uit de verpakking wordt gehaal blijven er micro resten plastic in het voedsel achter en bij het innemen van het product, gaat 
het zich een baan vormen in de longen.	2011-06-02 07:11:57 UTC	http://www.jwbhandling.nl	1	-1

8221897	ask hn: audio-based monitoring tools?	i remember seeing, maybe a couple of years ago, a web-based server activity monitoring tool that played a stream of sounds based on what was happening to servers or code. commits, successful builds, i think server load as well...<p>the idea, iirc, was to have this constant audio stream on the background, so one could easily detect anomalies without having to look at a dashboard all the time.<p>i can&#x27;t seem to find this tool anywhere now, no matter how much googling i try. maybe i&#x27;m trying the wrong terms, or something.<p>but, since it&#x27;s been quite a while, i am also wondering if there are any other tools lately that target this space. all i could find was peep (http:&#x2f;&#x2f;peep.sourceforge.net&#x2f;intro.html), but this seems to be legacy, and even then only for network monitoring.<p>does anyone remember about the tool i described, or know about some related software?	2014-08-25 14:30:41 UTC		1	0

1420554	great tools for bug tracking, and then some	hey guys, this definitely feels like a "just google it" question, but i didn't come across good discussion on this yet.<p>what do you use for issue tracking and metrics?<p>i've used clearcase extensively, and its way too detailed and complicated to use. its nice to have the features, but when you have to jump through a dozen dialogs and checkboxes just to send a bug to testing or change the status to 'in progress', its way too much work. ontime seems to be the same. you know what i mean. a tool that isn't easy to use isnt going to get used no matter how many features it has.<p>basecamp is pretty great, but its too highlevel. i cant see developers using it to worry about branches of code and releases and bugs.<p>so basically, i need a tool that is somewhere in between basecamp, msproject/clearcase/ontime, is properly usable for devs.<p>i know its out there.	2010-06-10 16:11:28 UTC		1	2

65539	a trend	there is a trend in hacker news.<p>i remember when i first registered on yc news there were way less direct(no external url) submissions. or so it seemed. this should be due to the nearing deadline for yc applications. it is vitally important to get as much positive attention from pg as possible; in fact it serves as one of yc news' main functions. but people should not try to be visible just for the sake of it. sometimes the extra submission may just be the one that irritates yc.<p>don't get me wrong, the majority of these submissions are great, interesting and fun to read. although occasionally you see one of those and you can't help but wonder. what i am trying to say is that people should be sincere about everything they do, and if there is nothing good to say then just listen and learn. i believe that you will get treated by the universe the same way you approach it.<p>but of course the real point of this submission is an attempt to show yc some criticism and analysis skills.	2007-10-09 22:56:41 UTC		10	10

766312	ask hn: staying sharp	here's the (relatively brief) story:<p>i went to university at a top 20 school in physics and mathematics, and paid my own way by working part-time doing web development. after being in a few research internship positions (cdf-fnal and some biophysics work), i realized that, while i thoroughly enjoyed higher level physics, i had developed a passion for web application development. consequently, when i was presented with a very enticing offer in july 2008, i decided to start working full time and do my last four classes (i only had non-science related electives remaining) over the next year or so.<p>as it turns out, the decision i made was a fortuitous one, due to the economic meltdown that occurred only a few months after i went from part-time work/full-time school to full-time work/part-time school. moreover, i do enjoy my job, and the ego boost of knowing that every day my hard work is put to use by tens of thousands of people (which is, in all honesty, one of the reasons i became so passionate about web applications in the first place).<p>but i've started realizing that my mind isn't as sharp as it used to be. as someone who was consistently challenged and put to the test in academia, i'm finding that i don't actually have any day-to-day challenges to push me and keep my scientific mind exercised. with my day job, regular open source contributions, girlfriend and social life, i don't have too much free time either.<p>my question is then: how do my fellow hn'ers keep their minds sharp? should i read more publications &#38; papers? should i try and do more scientifically oriented open source work? or is this just something i'm going to have to accept and deal with?<p>an insatiable appetite for learning sure is a hard thing to satisfy. any advice would be highly appreciated.	2009-08-16 17:09:35 UTC		53	70

836608	ask hn: moving to sf have a couple of questions	hi,<p>i'm a product director who also does front end development. i am moving to the sf area and wanted to ask a few questions.<p>if you were looking to hook up with a startup and start meeting people in the community where would you live? from my research i think mountain view would be a good place to live that is not super expensive. i am working on a few of my own startup ideas and am bootstrapping it myself for the first few months. my work related stuff has already won a few awards so would love to network with any rails/django coders in the area.<p>since i really don't know any of the areas in sf except from what i read online about where new startups are going. i would like to find a place that would be within easy driving distance of meetups and other social/tech functions.<p>i know this is not a normal hn type question, but i think perhaps it could be of use to others that are coming to the area and need a bit of info to make the jump. (i know it would be at least useful to me)<p>thanks for your help in advance.	2009-09-22 09:32:45 UTC		6	9

2557124	help from hn: investor wants to sue me	hi all,<p>throwaway here. i'm 21, i raised investment from an angel when i was 18 (or 19) - &#60;£100k, but a decent chunk of money. i raised this money in the days before i knew how stuff worked, and before i'd "learned my lessons" like, outsourcing your software dev rarely ends well. hindsight is a fabulous thing.<p>fast forward to now, we're 2 years into the investment, the money ran out 6 months ago, i stopped getting paid 12 months ago and we've been trying to make it work/recover ever since. i've even put all of the money i had into this (keeping the servers on etc).<p>now i've been offered a job, it literally fell into my lap with a group of guys i used to work for - good salary, back in the city doing what i used to. its brought us to a bit of a cross-roads because obviously i won't have the time to put into this to make it work.<p>(i have to accept the job due to financial commitments)<p>we've put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this.<p>i should preface this with, our investor isn't technical, and he's a bit direct - he believes what he believes and thats it.<p>ultimately, he wants to sue us based on 2 things:<p>1) in the contract, he would give us the second batch of money when we told him the tech worked. this provision was there because they were worried we couldn't actually make the tech.<p>when our developers finished the code, we checked it and signed it off. the tech was then delivered to us.<p>we sat down post-second batch and said "hey, if we want this to fly off the shelves we have a few things we might want to add/change". the changes we made improved on what we had, and also allowed us to go after new markets. we discussed this with him and he agreed - he even wanted to send me abroad to where our developers were based.<p>he's now saying that we're in breach of contract because it should have been working when we said it was. even though, well, it was and he agreed we should make the changes. as you software guys know you can add a couple of things and improve something massively. its not as though its ever really "finished".<p>i even demo'd the software to him at his house. he saw it work.<p>i have a letter from the developers saying the software works.<p>2) in the email with the scanned letter confirming "the tech was working" our fd said "we're real excited we can get out and sell, and talk to the patent guys". we spoke to the patent guys who said we didn't really have anything patentable, we just had business methods and algorithms (and we're based in the uk) - he advised us to use the money to develop the product and work on competitive advantages.<p>this point came out of nowhere, two or three months after i think i managed to convince him his opinion about the tech above - was wrong. he said we'd promised to patent it, even though we just said we were going to look into it. he refuses to accept that we were advised otherwise.<p>----<p>i guess having written this i don't really know what i expect anyone to say. i guess if someone can answer the question "does he have any grounds to sue me/us?"<p>the thing is - none of the information he has, or has spoken to his lawyers about has come direct from the software developers, or from the patent attorney. he has formed an opinion literally from discussions we've had, he's interpreted some things completely wrong. i'm not talking about things that perhaps he could see differently, but in a way a non-techy would look at a software project. he doesn't appreciate that its not like solid goods, they have bugs, things might need to be changed when you get some customers testing it.<p>he's really difficult, his response to "the developers have written a letter saying the software worked when we signed the agreement and the patent attorney told us not to patent it" is just to repeat his earlier point.<p>he's literally going to sue us just because he can. i may very well go bankrupt, which to be honest doesn't really bother me. our fd might have to put his hand in his pocket. i say that knowing that he has to win first, and i actually don't think we've done anything wrong. there is just no telling him.<p>if anyone can lend any advice i'd be greatly appreciative, i just don't think this is going to end well.<p>can he sue us? what should i do? what do you think? what would you do?<p>major thanks in advance.	2011-05-17 17:45:54 UTC		20	14

2992294	ask hn: i've launched, users have dried up, what's wrong? (repodrop.com)	i've recently launched repodrop - private git repository hosting.  i'm an experienced developer, but marketing is a whole new ball game.<p>i got my initial interest through blog posts, had some beta signups and emailed them at launch.  about 10% signed up, not bad i thought.<p>however, since then there have been virtually no new signups, i thought the site was broken at one point!  i've tried some targeted google adwords and facebook ads that have generated clicks but no signups (even though it is free to sign up with no commitment).<p>i think this is a common slump to end up in for techies-turned-entrepreneurs but like many before me i was blinded and thought it would be fine for me.<p>this is the product url: https://repodrop.com/<p>can you see anything obviously wrong with the product, homepage, signup, features, copy etc..?  do you have any advice what i can do to get some interest?  have i  completely misjudged the market?<p>admittedly it is a mvp at the moment and i plan to iterate on the product, but people aren't even finding out that it is an mvp at this stage and i don't have enough users to gather enough opinion on the required future feature set.<p>thanks.	2011-09-13 16:58:27 UTC		8	11

1537661	ask hn: what's better for email deliverability? own server/authsmtp/sendgrid?	we are running some experiments to decide which route to take for sending emails in our marketing automation saas product. i wanted to get advice/recommendation from you as well as learn from what you have experienced/decided on for "sending emails". we are experimenting to see what performs better for deliverability and here are our numbers for a recent very small test:&#60;p&#62;our server:  408 sent / 60 opened  - 14.7% open rate
authsmtp: 300 sent / 23 opened   - 7.67% open rate
sendgrid: 206 sent / 27 opened     - 13.01 open rate&#60;p&#62;its cheapest for us to send email from our server, authsmtp is more expensive than that and sendgrid is more expensive than authsmtp. you really cannot compromise on deliverability but (1) costs are significantly different and (2) open's is really a partial measure of deliverability, meaning even with 7.67% open rate, authsmtp "may" have delivered disproportionately more than the other channels.&#60;p&#62;would love to hear your experiences and suggestions.	2010-07-22 08:13:59 UTC		2	2

3323530	ask hn: is there a reliable way to sandbox untrusted code?	i'm designing on an application which involves running untrusted code.  the untrusted code does not need to make any system calls, just take a string as input and return a string as output.  there aren't any real constraints at this stage on the form in which the code should be provided.  source code, byte code or binaries would all be ok.<p>are there any ways to do this securely, at the moment?  nacl is intriguing, but there hasn't been much incentive to break it yet.  java and javascript sandboxes have probably been pounded on the hardest, but privilege escalation exploits for them do show up from time to time.  are there any other sandboxes i should be looking at?  is attempting to securely run untrusted code just a foolhardy enterprise?	2011-12-07 12:52:24 UTC		4	4

1863167	ask hn: experience with pen names or aliases?	i've just been discharged from a government job, however my problem is within the terms of the contract i am not allowed to have any online presence using my real name for the next five years (i was working in digital intelligence, it's complicated).
so i am now online using a pen name of sorts and am looking to start my own company, my only issue is i don't want a split identity i don't want to have to be one person offline and one person online. i want to start the company now as i need to sustain an income.
does anyone have any experience trading under a pen name, how do you introduce yourself etc and what do you do when it comes to invoicing etc.<p>i realise this is a bit of an odd question but you guys seem to be one of the more rational sources on the internet that could help me out with this predicament.	2010-11-03 01:12:27 UTC		16	7

2191220	ask hn: my app's been copied.  what do i do?	we've had a very successful iphone app on the market for the past 2.5 years.  we've been planning on releasing an android version within the next 4-6 months.  however, today we found out that somebody in the android market has copied our app almost identically.  they released it about a month ago.  it copies our layout exactly, our functions, our look, even graphics look similar.  now, this isn't a sort of copy, it's almost an identical copy.  if it was just 60% of our app that was copied, that's one thing.  but it's 99% of our app that's been copied.  i'm concerned that our iphone users who switch to android will be confused that we made the app, and also that it will hurt our future android endeavors.  so, what can we do about it?  can we send a cease and desist?  are there any laws to protect us?	2011-02-07 23:22:38 UTC		12	14

4991564	do you need a bs in cs to land job?	i began working for my fathers computer business when i was 8 years old. i started by working in the shop building computers after school and on weekends.
since then i have grown to a lot more responsibilities running the shop. i am 26 and i have been selling service contracts, setting up networks(2-100+ computers), server 2000/2003/2008 with active directory domains, mssql management, and design internal network apps in php and python (around 20+ satisfied customers using apps), along with the general computer repair tasks. (virus removal, upgrades, network security, etc...)<p>my question to the gurus in the biz, even though i skipped college but still have certifications, would i still be able to get a job in it at a small to large company without a bs in computer science if things went sour? everything i see online says a bs is a must. however we have had people working for us who have more than that, who i have had to train myself.<p>footnote in case: i am msce, mcsa, a+, network+, security+, and linux+ certified.	2013-01-01 01:32:13 UTC		3	6

2122781	ask hn: issue of integrity while changing job	i am working since last 5 yr in the present company. i am among the consistent top performer. 3 month back i decided to look for some other opportunity. and the first one only i got the offer. they are giving me around 100% hike (not in us). due to some reason, i was reluctant to that offer. though at that time i was in position to join the company. still during the discussion they said they will give 110% hike but in offer mentioned 100%. so to clarify i sent a mail to them for a revise offer. and send one more reminder. but they didn't sent any reply. so i too get busy with my current job.<p>after 2 month, i thought better to have a discussion with those guy. so i ringed up the hr and asked for the clarification. he told as we can give only 100% hike so we kept silent. but in friendly manner, i told him that at least i expect a professional call from you during that time. because till that offer we had good rounds of interviews (around 4-5) which all went fine. then in that discusion, he apologize for the mis communication and ask me whether i am again interested or not. as i was interested to join that company, i told i may be interested. then he called me after 2 more week extending the final offer with 100% hike.<p>but i am in dilemma whether to join or not? though company perspective i am interested to work. (not sure abt company culture very much though) but due to this unprofessional attitude also because i called them second times for clarification. i think i am struggling with the integrity issue.<p>any advice i really appreciate.	2011-01-20 05:33:42 UTC		1	0
