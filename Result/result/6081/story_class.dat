4470748	ask hn: unusual keyboard remaps, anyone?	i was looking at some old terminal and workstation pictures, which reminded me of the fact that what we're considering a "standard" keyboard layout hasn't been around for all that long. i'm not talking about qwerty or dvorak, but modifier keys (hyper, meta, alt, win etc.) or other auxiliary keys (backspace, delete, scroll lock, undo…).<p>switching your caps-lock to control is probably the most common change people do even nowadays. some also change it to esc (for vi users) or backspace - which, incidentally, at least one terminal had in place of the enter key.<p>if i remember correctly, way back when erik naggum said that he switched his numerical keys to the symbols (i.e. their shifted state) and used the function keys for the numbers (obviously on a keyboard where they're immediately above the numbers and not shifted sideways). he also moved his right-hand position one key to the right, and used the "new" column in the middle for braces, brackets etc.<p>so i was wondering what unusual tricks you've taught your keyboards, currently or in the past. i would guess hacker news to have a diverse enough crowd for some interesting tidbits.	2012-09-03 15:50:20 UTC		1	3

4764990	ask hn: famous entrepreneurs/developers who started on college newspapers?	hi hn, i need your help.<p>i'm an alumnus of san jose state university now working at an arts and technology nonprofit in sf. over the last two years i led an overhaul of the spartan daily's online presence, building a new site, new workflow tools, and new technology platform from scratch to put us on a solid foundation for at least the next ten years.<p>i'm graduating this year, and we're looking for someone to take over for me, but finding a person in the journalism department with the requisite tech skills is difficult.<p>the spartan daily offers the only thing close to a real-world tech job you can find on the sjsu campus, and we pay our senior staff members, so we think it should be easy to recruit from the cs department.<p>however, to make the position more enticing, i want to compile a list of (relatively) famous programmers or entrepreneurs who got their start working on their college newspaper.<p>the only one i know is yehuda katz, one of the core contributors to rails, but i know there are others. can any of you help me out?<p>also, if you're an sjsu student interested in the position or know somebody who might be, please get in touch, my email is in my profile.	2012-11-09 22:21:04 UTC		1	2

2237240	startup feedback	url:http://www.texaslovestickets.com<p>i'm kind of new to hacker news but i would like some feedback on my company from people who know what they are talking about. my idea is not new but hopefully i am different enough to be successful. i am selling tickets for small and medium sized bar type venues. i also sell tickets for school fraternities basically for a 2 dollar service charge on the tickets. i offer print tickets as well as tickets that can be scanned off of phones. i have also developed a 300 dollar netbook/ccd barcode scanner system that i can let venues use for free that can scan print tickets and tickets off of phone screens. are there other small companies doing this type of thing? i am the owner and i have extensive programming experience and my only expenses are web-hosting and a merchant account. i don't think there is a lot of competition for small venues and i am one guy so i don't have to make a million dollars to be happy. do you think this is something i could turn into a full time job? do you see any problems that i haven't thought of? i would just like some feedback from other people in the start-up scene. thanks!	2011-02-18 20:58:52 UTC		1	2

2534899	what's a good funnel (acquisition-through-retention) for a free mobile app?	hackers, this is my first post so please be gentle :)<p>my startup just launched an iphone app a few weeks ago and, aside from improving app performance, we're trying to understand what a good acquisition-through-retention funnel looks like to help us decide where to apply the throttle. we're a free app in the communication / news / social networking categories and our app is meant to be used everyday.<p>does anyone have a funnel they can share (without giving away your app of course) or ideas of where i can make the biggest improvement?<p>i understand the shape and metrics in the funnel depend on industry, type of app, and myriad other variables but just trying to get a ballpark of how we compare to other similar iphone / mobile apps that are built for consumer use (b-to-c).<p>here's where our funnel stands right now from acquisition through retention:<p>1) 75% of app downloads results in a new user (new users / downloads = 0.75)	4
2) 33% of which are weekly active users (have used our app in the past 7 days)	3
3) 66% of which are 3-day active users	0
4) 50% of which are 24-hour active users<p>so for every 100 downloads, we see an average of 8 users who use the app every day. breakdown:<p>1) 75 new users [this seems pretty good to me as a fraction of downloads]	4
2) 25 of which are weekly active users [seems like room for improvement]	0
3) 16 of which are 3-day active users [seems ok]	4
4) 8 of which are daily active users [seems ok]<p>overall, i'd give us grade of a b but that's a guess out of nowhere. any feedback / guidance / comparable figures would be mucho appreciated.	2011-05-11 02:31:53 UTC		2	3

1534757	a comprehensive, introductory course on mindfulness meditation	there seems to be some interest here recently on meditation its beneficial results that are of interest to hackers. developing the capacity for strong, calm focus and eliminating the detrimental effects of unhelpful mental functions are skills that take practice.<p>many of the posts that have been floating around don't give very much substance on the nuts and bolts of how to meditate. since hn is an erudite crowd of people who don't shy away from detailed topics, a more thorough reference is in order.<p>this is a 6 part introductory course that should take roughly a month to complete. it is self-paced and costs absolutely nothing. each week you add on to the foundation you build the week prior. there are 6 lectures covering the topics and practice. each one is a bit over one hour long and has lecture notes to go along with it.<p>the teacher's name is gil fronsdal. he was ordained as a monk and eventually returned to lay life to get his ph.d in buddhist studies from stanford. he is renowned for being exceptionally clear and simple without sacrificing any detail.<p>if programming is one of the most powerful tools used for hacking computers, then mindfulness meditation is one of the most powerful tools for hacking the brain.<p>good luck!	2010-07-21 09:48:40 UTC	http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1762/	2	0

8506690	tell hn: check out t-mobile	i&#x27;ve been thinking about posting this, and the verizon story reminded me. it&#x27;s not exactly related to hacking or startups (though if you&#x27;re a start-up founder or bootstrapper, you&#x27;re probably looking to reduce your expenses), but this is a community i frequent and would like to share it with people here.<p>if you&#x27;re not a t-mobile user, consider checking out their service.<p>i switched (back) this summer, and they paid $190 for my iphone 5 trade-in, and $150 for the remainder of my verizon contract (the latter as a prepaid mastercard, received quickly and easily used for their bills or anything else):<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;www.t-mobile.com&#x2f;offer&#x2f;switch-carriers-no-early-termination-fee.html<p>if you&#x27;re unsure, they&#x27;ll send you an iphone 5s to try for 7 days (i didn&#x27;t try this, so can&#x27;t comment):<p>http:&#x2f;&#x2f;explore.t-mobile.com&#x2f;test-drive-free-trial<p>i have no contract to fulfill with t-mo. i did have to purchase a new device which includes a payment plan, but the way i look at it, i got to upgrade from iphone 5 to 5s (and now the 6 is available), they bought my old phone and paid my fees, and i&#x27;m still paying ~$25&#x2f;mo. less compared to verizon. not a bad deal.<p>service seems roughly equivalent in my metropolitan area (and when i had them the first go-round they were superior to vzw at my location).<p>i hope this helps someone.<p>disclaimer: i&#x27;m not a shill, just an hn reader and occasional poster.	2014-10-25 00:34:45 UTC		5	0

1485912	ask hn: how to get important people to talk to me?	i've been working for a small company developing a web app for the past 6 months or so, and before they hired me, i was working on it by myself. they've lost interest in funding it, partially due to financial reasons, but i'm still really excited about the product which is very close to being functionally complete.<p>now that i've lost my job with this company, i plan to keep working on this product until it's done, but i feel that a major part of ensuring its success is to speak to business decision makers in my metro area (atlanta) to get as much feedback as possible. i'd like to know if they'd buy it, and if not, their reasons. i'm willing to make whatever changes will make it more appealing to my potential customers, which are online advertising firms.<p>i guess my question is, how should i go about getting these people to agree to meet with me? should i join local organizations of which they are likely to be a part? should i just call their companies directly and come right out and ask for a meeting? maybe it's as simple as that, but i suspect it might not be.	2010-07-04 16:44:30 UTC		6	0

3976456	android platformer	so recently i have been working on a project. by recently i mean for the past year or so. it is finally nearing completion, and i wanted to get some user feedback on it.<p>basically, the game is a standard platformer. move around, jump, you know, that kind of stuff. the game is a puzzle platformer though, so things try to kill you while you attempt to solve a puzzle. you collect batteries as you play through the game, and if you use a battery, you get larger, allowing you to move blocks around at the price of your mobility. click the same button to remove the battery and get smaller.<p>thats the basics of the game play, and where the real exciting part begins. i have been working on an inline level editor for the game. it allows you to create your own levels using parts from the game and play them as you edit them. this keeps the game constantly new and fresh.<p>i was hoping i could get some feedback about what i am working on, any ideas to make it more appealing. i would really appreciate it.<p>oh, and i have a video posted here, i am going to update it later tonight with the new level editor stuff and the better ui, but this will do for now :p<p>http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1621630581/android-platformer	2012-05-15 13:35:19 UTC		7	1

7263425	ask hn: my industry's becoming commoditised and i'm scared	for the last 12 years i&#x27;ve worked as a web developer, first solo, then part of a couple of firms, then solo again. i&#x27;ve always prided myself on inquisitiveness and giving businesses what they want, but more and more the budgets - and industry expectation - is to roll out a piece of off-the-shelf software (wordpress, drupal, magento), stick some bootstrap code on it, apply a layer of design and push it out. i&#x27;m not getting job satisfaction and i don&#x27;t feel i&#x27;m doing good work.<p>i&#x27;ve built large custom business systems (integrated sales&#x2f;crm&#x2f;accounting&#x2f;order management), but the demand for these has dried up as saas integrated with other saas works out much cheaper.<p>i watched it happen to my uncle (a chartered accountant) - it&#x27;s gone from a well-respected, well-paid profession to being data-entry using low-qualified staff and a few highly-qualified advisors.<p>designers seem to have it even worse: no need to create, just assemble ready designed components and use off-the-shelf themes). i look at the &#x27;enterprise software&#x27; firms that i&#x27;ve had as clients and their staff have become &#x27;integrators&#x27;, gluing together oracle&#x2f;microsoft systems to give the client (something of) what they want.<p>i was aware of jobs becoming commoditised; naively i didn&#x27;t expect it to happen to me. and i&#x27;m scared. i never wanted to be an assembler, to see all the fun stuff automated; i chose my career in the heady early days of the web, when there was so much to figure out.<p>what do you recommend, and are there any industries or services which aren&#x27;t&#x2f;aren&#x27;t yet&#x2f;can&#x27;t be commoditised?	2014-02-19 13:18:34 UTC		22	0

3443576	why does android fragmentation matter?	i was initially writing this as a response to a comment in http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3443005 a now deleted thread. unfortunately i wasn't able to submit it before the thread was gone. i spent some time writing all of this down and wanted to share my experience as a user who migrated from ios to android. so here is the comment followed by my response. i hope i am not breaking any rules with this hn post - feel free to delete/downvote the thread if i did.<p>http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3443202	3
&#62; one thing i don't understand about all this talk of fragmentation: why does it matter? should i care that some phones have three buttons and some have four? should i care that screen resolutions vary? should i care that the kindle fire doesn't have the stock android homescreen? what do any of these things matter? when i download an app, it works perfectly fine no matter what the platform specifics are. it's all android-compatible.<p>compare the quality of ios apps to android apps.<p>sure, there are examples on both ends of the spectrum for both platforms but my personal opinion is that the average quality of ios apps is much higher than the current average for android - a lot of this quality comes from a single device to test on and design for. almost every app i tried for android just felt like a html widget rendering some 'mobile' version of some site/service. the fun part is, most websites visited with safari on ios felt like native apps - that's not the case with android and device varieties is a strong factor here.<p>i used an iphone for over 3 years (3g model) - i downloaded maybe around 90 apps during that time and bought ~40 in the same period. my highest purchase was probably around 20€ and the average would hover around 5€. most of the purchases were performed in the early phase of me owning the phone when i had a lot to pick from. later on i bought as something new/interesting caught my attention.<p>it's not happening with android. i'm using it for almost an year now. i did one, literally one purchase during that time and it was minecraft pocket edition when it was on sale for less than 1€. based on my example you could generally forget about android users spending less on apps because of their financial/preference differences to iphone users. heck, my financial situation got significantly better during all this time but i don't see myself spending <i>any</i> money on the android app store anytime soon.<p>it's just about the quality in my case. i literally use 2 apps that i consider of acceptable quality on android - opera mobile and baconreader for reddit. opera gained a lot from it's ui redesign they did after releasing the mini version to the iphone, the previous iteration looked and behaved a lot like the default android browser and that resulted with a large user slash back. baconreader is simply the best reddit client available at this point for android but it can't really compare to alien blue (imho of course). i saw no other apps of interest for me with acceptable quality.<p>generally i am disappointed with the os and the apps available for it. my iphone stopped receiving updates after 2 years of usage? not sure about the exact time span but i remember getting them much more often and for a longer period than the samsung galaxy s i am currently owning and guess what? samsung recently announced that it will not be bringing ics to this device - so it's either root the device or stick to older software even though the device is capable of running ics.<p>i mentioned that the os feels bad. i will point out one flaw for starters but will gladly provide more if this starts a discussion. so please tell me who was the genius that decided it's a good idea to unlock my phone if i answer a call using the headset button? i hate searching for the phone burried in my pocket during the winter...<p>to give you a better overview of my purchasing habit during ios usage, here is the list of apps i paid for on it. i will skip the free ones and limit myself to just the ones i found installed on the device, most names are taken from their thumbnails and the fact that i 'paid' for them is from memory so sorry if an error sneaked in.<p>- appsniper<p>- prehistorik<p>- deadly dungeons<p>- aqua forest<p>- assasin's creed<p>- doom<p>- duke nukem 3d<p>- dungeon hunter<p>- dungeon hunter 2<p>- appbox pro<p>- mobile mouse<p>- touchterm<p>- scany<p>- 2do<p>- issh<p>- ipharoh<p>- wesnoth<p>- alien blue<p>- rooms irc client<p>- rage<p>- game dev story<p>- idracula<p>- nightcamera<p>- taptap revenge 3<p>- jotnot pro<p>- orions<p>- doom resurrection<p>- space monkey<p>- worms<p>- worms 2<p>- samurai<p>- vlc remote<p>- zombie<p>- soundhound<p>- sc2casts<p>- spore<p>- wolf3d<p>this came out longer than i initially intended to and a bit more chaotic/rant like than i usually like to write. sorry for that.<p>tl;dr;	3
i used ios for &#62;3 years. buying apps regularly. switched to android and bought 1 (for a ridiculous price) app during an year of usage. i blame it on app quality which mostly comes from device variety.	2012-01-09 18:14:10 UTC		1	2

8785850	ask hn: what should i learn to create my project?	i have an idea that i want to transform into a mvp, but i can&#x27;t properly code. i know the very basics of css+html and javascript, just enough to know that i am capable of learning to code.<p>i want to know not only what language and framework to learn, but what should i use to actually deploy and publish my product (a saas, more on the idea below). as i see on regular beginner&#x27;s learning platforms - codecademy and etc - this is a most overlooked field. should i use aws, a server on digital ocean, some platform as a service that i don&#x27;t know yet but is more user friendly?	2
in all of this the only thing i know is how to buy a domain. after that, i need to learn.<p><i>about the idea:</i><p>i want to create a tool that transforms a list of links on a visual board.<p>imagine you want to learn about quantitative finance. you ask a friend who happens to know a lot about it and he emails you back with a list of links to pages where you should begin to learn. among these links there is a diversity of pages: a wikipedia article, two youtube videos (one is a lecture, other an interview), three books&#x27; amazon pages, four twitter accounts to follow, two blogs, one podcast, a particular post of another blog and a project&#x27;s github.<p>i would like to build a tool that take that list of links and transform into a one-page visually attractive and didatic board, summarizing and giving a small taste of all the resources.<p>think of what facebook do to individual links when you post on your timeline: youtube videos can be seen on the spot, twitter accounts are shown the avatar and description, blog posts are shown some thumbnail image and the beginning of the post text, wikipedia is shown the title of the article and first paragraph. you get the idea. most are just the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;description&gt; of the linked page, a few relevant sites get special treatment (like youtube or vimeo).<p>the mvp would allow anyone to transform your hyperlinks into a public, temporarily available board.	2014-12-22 23:17:43 UTC		1	2
6962898	what does a game developer do to promote his game?	chase race is a completely new gaming experience because it gives you a quite new feeling of the combination of strategy and tactical maneuvers while racing cars are running against each other in simultaneous moves.it&#x27;s a whole new feeling to think both strategy and movement at the same  time.	2
all have 8 seconds to choose his car next move and chase race has exciting strategy pieces that can tune the race cars driving ability.	1
that you can play with in the garage between races, where you tune the car, so the right combination of strategy pieces are placed in the race car before the time trial for pole position.	0
it&#x27;s as if the cars drive like in reality, both stopping distance and acceleration are like in reality.you simply crash, if you drive too fast and the car loses its ability to  make laneshift maneuvers as the number of crash increase.	0
in the pit, you can repair the engine, change tires and refuel, so you do not run out of fuel during the race.	4
there are so many strategic and tactical elements in the chase race app, so it leads too far to talk about it here.	3
but i thought i&#x27;d share this  strategy racing game with others because the more players we get, the bigger the pot, which you can win the world cup.	0
there is no luck in the chase race, but your strategic skills will determine the outcome of the races. who wins the prize?	3
it&#x27;s also really exciting to play for vouchers, which you can buy itune gifts cards for. but try to download from the appstore or the website: www.chase race.com. i hope to see you on the race track.	2013-12-25 12:40:25 UTC		1	0

2)translate username and password to integers using this list, then add them together and save the resulting integer in userhashes.html	2
3)add the username, password, and userhash and use the sum to encrypt temptransform.json, then save it as userhashtransform.json;	1
4)on subsequent user login, take entered username and passwords add them together using all available rawtransforms looking for userhashtransform collisions.  decrypt with sum if username, password, and user hash. if alphabets match, authenticate user.<p>essentially you create a huge solution space problem only the right username/password combo can solve in reasonable time.<p>i bet that samsonite, i'm way off, but please tell me how to protect user data with a client side only js/css3/html5/bootstrap site? i want an open source drop in js login script we can all verifiably agree is secure so this doesn't happen to me.	2012-10-06 10:46:43 UTC		2	0

1737020	ask hn: an ethical dilemma in recommending an android drm solution fix	an alternative android app store invited me to sell my apps in their marketplace, which requires integration of a complicated in-house drm scheme to protect apps from piracy. upon investigating the docs and sample code for the integration process, i was amazed to see heaps and heaps of unnecessary complexity, brittle design, and many opportunities for mistakes in integration.<p>somehow the part of me that abhors terrible software design took over, and before i really thought about it, i had sent them a very detailed proposal for an alternative design that both fully integrated with their existing infrastructure and reduced integration complexity from a collection of scattered changes to java source (which would break compatibility with other marketplaces) to a three-line xml change in an application's manifest (which could even be applied in an automated fashion upon upload to the marketplace), with no need to even recompile existing code.<p>the issue now, after a few rounds back and forth with their team, is that i've come to privately realize a major exploit in my design which would allow the creation of a general-purpose launcher app that would completely evade the drm scheme i recommended.<p>should i continue to help this company improve the developer friendliness of their egregious drm solution? this would (1) make them much more attractive and lead to many more adopters of their marketplace (2) stop a precedent from being set for android developers having to customize their code for a distinct marketplace and (3) rid the world of a piece of software design that, at best, discourages integration, and, at worst, inspires a new era of terrible drm design.<p>alternatively, should i tell them about the exploit, its mechanism, and its implications, and suggest they stop implementation?<p>thirdinatively, should i just keep helping them fix their stuff (which has its share of existing exploits already), and keep quiet about the exploit, leaving it as an easter egg for the curious few with both a deep enough understanding of the android framework and experience with this particular marketplace to discover on their own?<p>(actually this is really two intertwingled choices: {continue helping vs. suggest stopping} and {reveal exploit vs. keep quiet})	2010-09-28 19:57:06 UTC		12	3

2929612	iphone vs android app sales: numbers from an indie developer	hey hn,<p>i've been a full time indie iphone developer for about 9 months. i've recently ported my 2nd highest selling iphone app to android. here is a comparison for the first 2 weeks of sales. if other ios developers are out there that are thinking of porting to android, i hope this may be of help.<p>to keep things fair i'm only comparing one version of my paid iphone app to its android equivalent (fantasy football monster '11). this does not include any ad revenue, in app purchases or ipad sales.<p>date         android  iphone<p>aug 25, 2011 $177.67  $420<p>aug 24, 2011 $261.30  $382<p>aug 23, 2011 $386.68  $386<p>aug 22, 2011 $447.26  $425<p>aug 21, 2011 $422.18  $585<p>aug 20, 2011 $280.06  $403<p>aug 19, 2011 $211.09  $352<p>aug 18, 2011 $194.37  $388<p>aug 17, 2011 $357.39  $342<p>aug 16, 2011 $463.99  $330<p>aug 15, 2011 $384.55  $407<p>aug 14, 2011 $376.20  $483<p>aug 13, 2011 $263.34  $502<p>aug 12, 2011 $209.00  $508<p>total            $4428.08 $5914<p>per day          $316.29  $422.43<p>so, overall the android version of my app makes about 75% of its iphone equivalent. this is significantly better than i expected.<p>one more data point. the android app is currently about 250ish overall top paid, and the iphone version is 350ish. take from that what you will.<p>some quick observations about android from an ios developer's perspective:<p>1) i think developing <i>quality</i> apps is easier on ios. i'm actually a java/.net developer by profession so i should naturally be biased toward android. but once you get past the initial learning curve, i think that cocoa touch apis get you 90% of the way there, whereas android apis get you about 30% of the way there. that is to say, if you want a lot of the nice ui touches you're used to on the iphone, you'll have to spend much more effort getting there on android. the main advantage i feel android has is memory management, but the reference counting method that objective-c uses is second nature once you are familiar with the fundamentals.<p>2) android gives you real time sales analysis. this is pretty incredible. yes you can somewhat simulate this on iphone using 3rd party analytics, but being able to see the moment someone bought your app just brings my obsession with checking sales and stats to another level. you also get your daily reports much sooner (about 12:30am pst as opposed to 5-6am pst).<p>3) android market screws up orders quite a bit. in fact, almost 20% of all orders are declined or cancelled due to some android market error. after checking forums, it seems like this is not unusual. now, i don't know if this means i have 20% lost sales, but still disturbing nonetheless. in android's defense, apple actually never gives you this level of detail. to my knowledge, you don't know if users can't buy your app due to an app store error. but judging from the fact that we get e-mails about this issue every other day on android and i've never gotten a single e-mail about this in the past 15 months i've been on the app store is very telling. google has got to fix this. developers lose, customers lose, and google loses.<p>in conclusion, i feel like the android market has really come into its own. the common wisdom that android owners do not pay for apps is demonstrably false. they may not pay as much per user for apps as iphone owners, but the enormous marketshare android commands is just too much to ignore.<p>i'll try to address any questions or comments in a timely manner, but i'm currently in europe so please forgive me i don't get to all of them. thanks for reading.	2011-08-26 19:18:27 UTC		292	3

7195385	feeling uninspired after failed startup?	hi hn community,<p>i&#x27;m desperately in need of some help here. just a few months ago i stopped building a startup with my friend that i had began 7 months earlier, and ever since then i have been simply languishing. no longer with the commitment of a job or big project to keep me busy and challenged, i haven&#x27;t been doing much of anything. i&#x27;ve traveled some to see friends, tinkered away on some small javascript projects, and blogged a lot -- but that&#x27;s about it. most days i just read books or browse twitter and hn.<p>i have no clue what i should do next. i&#x27;m only 18, but graduated high school two years early and joined a startup immediately upon graduation. so this is really the first time i have been without any commitments. i was thinking about traveling the us some more and finding companies that would be willing to exchange web dev work for room and board, but i haven&#x27;t started looking into that much yet.<p>my hope with posting here is that i&#x27;ll find someone that has gone through a similar experience of languishing and getting nothing done. i feel lazy, embarrassed to meet people for fear of them asking what i&#x27;m up to -- because the answer would be nothing. anyone have advice on how to move forward? how to find inspiration or motivation?	2014-02-07 08:55:14 UTC		1	4

5819841	how can i get an idea for a business?	guys, i have a problem.<p>i knew that i wanted to start a business ever since i was in college. but i just kind of got stuck in this rut. i don't know what kind of business i want to start. i keep flipping and flopping from ideas to ideas, and never know which ones to stick with. i've gone from ebook ideas to dropshipping to consulting... there are a million possibilities to make a million, but i just can't seem to stick with one. i really want to start a business. i wouldn't even mind if it covered my cost of living (which is around $2000 a month). i want to just start already. but i'm afraid of picking the wrong idea, and losing a lot of time, effort, and money into something that will not turn out right. maybe at this point, it is better to just do __something___, without even caring about the success. i just want to pick one idea, and dedicate my entire being into it. i just want to live and breath my own business and not think about anything else. but the initial start is killing me. i don't want to get into a unprofitable market. what should i do? i want to start a business by the end of this month. i want to give it my all. can somebody just give me a business idea?	2013-06-04 15:13:07 UTC		1	2

608342	advice from hackernews on my facebook app and website?	our app is at http://apps.facebook.com/textcontest and our site is http://tmtcinc.com .<p>it is a weekly contest in which you receive a prompt in the am (ex: "what's a funny way to lose a girl in 10 seconds?"), to which you are encouraged to respond. if you have a cell phone, we can text you the prompt. if not, you can use our application.<p>i post and rank the funniest entries that afternoon, awarding points and updating the standings throughout the season.<p>so far it is just a few dozen ppl who play each week, mostly friends or friends of friends. i experimented by spending a tiny amount on targeted ad space on facebook, and got better-than-expected results as far as ctr and getting people to install and even consistently use the app.<p>but i'm hesitant to spend more on advertising if this is just going to be a waste of time.  what do you think?  funny idea?	2009-05-14 06:15:27 UTC		2	3
2035488	ask hn: i don't want to be a software engineer. now what?	i didn't start programming as a kid. i didn't write my first line of code until freshman year of college. problem sets in [functional programming language] were fun and satisfying, then i found myself loving classes like discrete math, algorithms, and complexity theory, so i decided to major in computer science. when it was time to get a job, i had some offers for more money than i thought a 22 year old ever made, so i took one. but i don't love software engineering.<p>i know i'm lucky to have a job, and my salary lets me do all sorts of fun things. furthermore, i have no idea what to do instead, so letting time pass at my current job seems like the best option. but i don't want to find myself with the same problem in 5 years.<p>so i ask you, hn: what should i do? shut up and be grateful my 22 year old self has it better than 99% of the world? have any of you found yourselves with this "problem"?	2010-12-23 19:07:28 UTC		2	3

mysimplecircle.com is like an address book for the 21st century, everyone maintains their own information instead of you maintaining everyone else’s information; which ends up being out of sync when they move or change phone numbers. you add your personal information, address, phone, email, and web links of sites you are on and you share the information with the people that you want to see; this can either by group or on an individual basis. some information you might want to only share with your family and some with friends and you can choose what information you want to share. it can also be any type of information also that you want to share. you can also create groups with preset permissions or set permissions by the individual. there is also a public group that you can add yourself into and share some information, but of course minimal amount, maybe just enough for someone to find you and ask to connect with you. you can show hobbies, professional interests, anything. people might want to connect with you by different criteria if you’re in the public group, by hobby or different interests. if you don’t want to be in the public directory, you can send email invites for people to join you on mysimplecircle. you changed your phone number? just change it in mysimplecircle and the people that have my simple circle accounts will see that reflected automatically.  join a new site? update that in mysimplecircle.com  and share the information to the people that you would like to join you.	2012-02-06 23:58:53 UTC		4	1

5847446	isn't it advantageous for a company to use stackoverflow instead of a forum?	i&#x27;m a coder, and there&#x27;s still a lot of companies using crappy web forum software.<p>why run a forum when you could point customers to stackoverflow, and have your tech support guys lurk there to help them?<p>reasons i see it would be advantageous:<p>- don&#x27;t need to host a forum (less bandwidth, server usage)<p>- better answers as there&#x27;s less duplication, and bounties for unanswered questions<p>- but most importantly, people like me look at the number of questions&#x2f;answers on stackoverflow to see if a new product is worth pursuing or not.<p>full disclosure: i am not affiliated w so, but i am a fan and regular user.	2013-06-09 03:36:27 UTC		6	0

7527967	ask hn: how much experience do you need to start freelancing?	although i&#x27;m currently working full-time as a rails developer and reasonably satisfied with my job, i&#x27;ve been daydreaming about becoming a freelancer&#x2f;consultant. i&#x27;ve had a taste of that lifestyle once before and really enjoyed the freedom. i was able to do things that are impossible to do in a traditional job - for example, i took a 5 week road trip and worked 10 - 15 hours a week while i was on the road. and unlike some hackers out there i really enjoyed the business side of freelancing as well. it was fun to speak with new clients, manage my own income, and send out invoices. the only reason i decided to take a full-time job was so that i could get some professional experience with building enterprise scale web apps and to learn from people more experienced than me.<p>this job has allowed me to grow tremendously as a developer, but i&#x27;ve only been at it for a little over a year and i&#x27;m concerned that potential clients will want someone with more experience. i consider myself to be a pretty good dev (and have a lot of github projects to prove it), but for some reason i&#x27;m fixated on the idea that i need x number of years of experience under my belt before i can be taken seriously as a full-time freelancer&#x2f;consultant.<p>those of you who are freelancers, how many years of professional experience did you accrue before jumping into freelancing full-time? what did you charge your clients when you first got started?	2014-04-03 23:42:20 UTC		1	4

3575257	secondary sales and venture capitalists – an unhealthy mix	looking on all kind of nice seed fundings (in range of millions of dollars) for very trivial ideas, i wonder why actually there are people (mostly vcs) investing in such, from my point of view, non sustainable ideas. i always thought that this is just some kind of game between rich people to fool other rich people to earn money almost from nothing. helge gives in his blog some interesting view on that, which i think reflects some of my thoughts how all this vc buisiness model works.<p>i wonder why i haven't seen much of same things happening in europe. is it because of strong regulations or is it because of more conservative buisiness models?	2012-02-10 10:45:04 UTC	http://techentrepreneurship.com/2011/11/01/secondary-sales-and-venture-capitalists-%E2%80%93-an-unhealthy-mix/	1	2

712020	ask hn: twitter full access?	recently i've come up with simple 'applications' of twitter (amd related services like blogs and comments and whatnot) that for startups and other companies is easily worth $5 / month, i suspect i could build a monetazible product around it.<p>so i looked around, and it seems twitter used to have a full 'firehose' feed, but they stopped providing it. you can get on a developer 'whitelist' where you can get a 'representative' feed, which still isn't the full thing. <i>i want the full thing.</i> i think a lot of services and mashups are using api calls such as 'search', but this is very limited, as i'd want all the other data in order to extract the relevant signals.<p>this is an unfortunate situation. i understand it's their product, but it seems like 'public resource'. to make a bad analogy, imagine if larry page and sergey brin couldn't crawl the web because most of it was on one companies' servers and they wouldn't let them --- it'd be our loss.<p>i found companies like gnip.com that seem to have access to the full twitter data and are also aggregating other data. they're charging $1000 / year, which sounds reasonable, except i don't see a 'trial' to see what to expect. also, how did they get full access and how much are they paying?<p>any ideas and insights would be appreciated!	2009-07-18 18:36:14 UTC		1	3

2344284	ask hn: pls. give me a hard prog. problem (re: talent wars)	this will be an unusual request for a job.<p>i've read fred wilson's blog post: 'the war for talent'. i am living in eastern europe (hungary) and when i read posts like that (and similar techrunch articles) i am always wondering: i know most people in the valley are very talented. but are they that much more talented than people in other parts of the world?	2
my yearly salary is $36.000. it is very good in my country. people in the valley earn $100.000 or more.	2
why are most sv companies not looking for help from other countries? do they think communication problems are so serious that it is not worth it? or do they somehow think that there is absolutely no talent in cheaper countries?<p>here is a crazy request: give me a very hard programming (algorithmic) problem. harder what you usually ask at interviews. (i usually very easily solve interview problems at typical companies.) give me something so hard that if i can solve it in some days you hire me as a freelancer for remote work for $50/hour. (it is a crazy amount for me, but give me a very hard problem.)	1
a problem can be for example something like this: do this and this in o(nlogn) time and with o(logn) memory.<p>does not matter if i will fail. i want to know: the reason i cannot earn sv-level salary is that i am not talented enough. also i love thinking on very hard problems, i am addicted to them. (once i was thinking about p vs. np for a whole month. i learned tons of math during that.)<p>please don't give me something which cannot be solved in 6-7 hours. i have a day job and two small children, so i can think only for 3 hours / day.<p>thanks.	2011-03-19 18:17:16 UTC		2	2

10191949	ask hn: should i join a startup or keep working on my own (for now)?	i&#x27;m a senior computer science student from indian institute of technology, roorkee. right now i&#x27;m facing a situation, surrounded with too many thoughts and unable to walk properly.<p>the situation is, some awesome people at my institute are starting up a logistic based platform, which is going to be great (no doubts here). i was asked to join them, i loved the product they have currently.<p>but the other part of the game is, along my journey at the institute here, i have created a passion for open source and some exciting fields of the computer science.<p>i (kind of) believe that i come up with too many ideas, ranging from anything to everything, i try to note them down and work on them to reflect them on my github[1] and my blog[2].<p>i have a strong attraction towards &#x27;data science&#x27;, &#x27;systems &amp; infrastructure&#x27; and &#x27;distributed systems&#x27;.<p>last year, i found out about datadog[3] while working on the &#x27;github&#x27;s 3rd data challenge&#x27;. i immediately loved the organization because it deals with all the things i like(data &amp; infrastructure), so i applied for an engineering internship, went through the interview process and got the job. but later things went wrong and i wasn&#x27;t able to go through the visa process.<p>on applying again, being pessimistic i think about not getting the visa (h1-b) this time too.<p>initially i wasn&#x27;t interested in studying higher but now i&#x27;m getting a feeling for it, not because i&#x27;m out of other options, just because i have some things in my list(to-do) relating to academia and i would love to see them happening. although i can&#x27;t go for it anytime soon, because i don&#x27;t have that much money.<p>so the situation is, what to do? the startup is going to be awesome, their product is great but i&#x27;m lacking a strong ignition towards it, that i see while working on my own little projects. not sure if it&#x27;s because of my addiction towards it.<p>[1] https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;pravj&#x2f;	0

269413	advice on doing development for equity/deferred payment	i am the founder of ideas2it(www.ideas2it.com) which has a onshore/offshore team. the idea is to be technology partners for startups to bring their ideas to market without taking too much funding. a good case of this model is www.scoobydeal.com, a rails site which we implemented from concept to completion in just 3 months.<p>though i am willing to share the risk on ideas i believe in, by taking part of the compensation in equity, i am being repeatedly asked to do the whole work for equity or deferred payment.<p>there is a particularly interesting(very interesting technology, good background of the founder,etc) project on the table, which i am being asked to do on deferred payment. i.e. payment on angel funding, till then 1% interest after first 6 months.<p>what are the pitfall of such a deal? if i go for it, how should i structure the deal?	2008-08-07 06:15:10 UTC		4	3

1009518	ask hn: have any of you ever wanted to write a compiler or interpreter?	hi everyone,<p>i'm looking for feedback on a project i would like to start. basically, i would like to start an educational project built around compiler and interpreter design.<p>i remember wanting to learn how to write a compiler for the longest time. however, each time i'd approach the subject to learn more, i would run into some kind of hurdle and eventually get distracted by other projects. the hurdle usually came in the form of poor access to good educational information.<p>there are books available like the famous dragon book. however, i feel that there needs to be an alternative entry vector into the field of compiler and interpreter design. the project i'm considering would consist of a simple yet fully functioning compiler (or interpreter) with a heavy amount of documentation. beyond this trivial implementation, subjects like jit, stack vs register, dispatching methods, and compiler frameworks could be explored.<p>i have a small interpreter half written for a compiler design class i took at university. but i also plan on building a web site to hold all the documentation and educational material.<p>would any of you benefit from a project like this? i'm willing to go it alone for quite a while, but eventually i would need help from the open source community.<p>thanks,	2

48800	troublesome manager.. what would you do?	so i'm a senior at top 10 engineering university and since january i have been working as lead webdev on a large, sponsor/government-funded project. i've done everything from focus groups, usability studies, surveys and have been creating a top-notch site. <p>i was away for two weeks in the time between summer semester's end and the beginning of fall semester and got an email from my manager saying essentially "hey, i've been working with someone else on the site". what was created from that was a complete bastardization of the design and was all new code. i had lots of php for general ease of dev and the new guy did all 50+ files in html.<p>fast-forward to yesterday, new guy won't be working on it anymore and my manager wants me to take over. i've looked at this guy's code and it's a horrible mess - i want nothing of it. deadline is in about a week.<p>going back to my code is an equally large task as he had been adding other pages, content and "design features".<p>what would you do? i'm sure i am not the only one that has had this problem.	2007-08-31 17:34:01 UTC		8	0

4843814	ask hn: how do you deal with overblown self-assessment of team members?	the management wants to have a "profile" of every developer, listing all the skills and the level of expertise.<p>i tend to downgrade my skills because i compare myself to some really good developers and use their expertise/skills as a reference. and i am not the guy to list "risc assembly" just because i played around with it for 2 hours.<p>however, some of my team members wrote in their profile stuff like "javascript +++++" and "unix ++++" (+ = basic knowledge, +++++ = professional level).	1
of course, this is very distorted, since they just scratch the surface of jquery ($.ajax and other basic stuff; we are not talking about vanilla js and its architectural features) and their unix skills consist of opening a terminal in ubuntu linux and doing "mkdir bla" and "rm -rf bla".	3
the thing is: i dont want to complain to the management because it might look unprofessional, and i dont want act like a smart-ass within my team and tell these people to downgrade themselves.<p>is there a sensitive way to approach this issue?<p>p.s. i have no clue how these profiles are going to be used by the management.	2012-11-28 18:07:09 UTC		10	3
307310	im in	hi everyone... i have been reading hn for about six months now.. firstly i'd like to say that this is a great community from which i've got invaluable information on not only startups but also many other useful links and info about programming and web developement in general. also off topic stuff(like the hyperbrain ownerś manual) which i could really relate to. i didn't create an account for so long as i thought(and still think) that i didn't have much to contribute. i've been interested in the internet ever since the first dial up connections came to my town(i was 11 then i think) but because i went to a residential school i didn't have a lot of access. now that i've finally got time(and a lot of it) i am gonna start pursuing web dev.<p>now for the question part. i've been learning python since past 2 months and have picked it up quite well. i plan to start with some framework for server side now(probably django). i have very less knowledge of html so i plan to learn that next and then learn javascript for client side stuff. am i on the right path? any suggestions and recommendations would be appreciated.	1

857809	xoopit for gmail closing	dear xoopit for gmail user,<p>we will be officially turning off xoopit for gmail on november 13, 2009, to focus our efforts on making my photos for yahoo! mail an amazing product and bring those features to all yahoo! mail users. given our focus, we decided we cannot adequately support the xoopit for gmail product and give you a great experience in the future. here are some details to guide you through this transition.<p>do i need to download any files or pictures?<p>most xoopit for gmail users follow standard gmail conventions and choose to archive—not delete—mail. in this case all of your data should still be accessible via gmail. if you have ever posted to a blog from xoopit you should download those photos and host them on another site (e.g., flickr). if you do not download these photos by november 13, 2009, you will no longer be able to access them through xoopit.<p>are there gmail features that can help me?<p>yes! the following gmail labs features may help with your migration away from xoopit.<p><pre><code>    * search autocomplete	2
* youtube previews in mail	3
* picasa previews in mail	0
* flickr previews in mail	3
* google search	3
</code></pre>	3
you can also do searches like "filename:(jpg or png)" (to see all the emails that have photo attachments) or "has:attachments" (for all the emails with attachments). see gmail's page on advanced search for more details. you won’t have the exact same experience as xoopit, but it will help.<p>to help you through this transition, we've compiled a list of the most frequently asked questions and resources here.<p>thank you for using xoopit for gmail. we’ll miss you!<p>the xoopit team	2009-10-02 19:29:40 UTC	http://www.xoopit.com/faq	11	4

243920	ask yc: finding a co-founder(s)	i've been out of school for almost a year and a half now, working as a financial analyst for a large finance/accounting firm in los angeles.  i've known for quite some time that i won't be truly happy working for a large company and that entrepreneurship is in my blood (no one in my family works for anyone else).  i also spent two years in college doing sales for a small web services/software company and got a lot of exposure to the development of a saas solution and the web as it relates to small-to-mid-size businesses.  i spend a significant portion of my free time researching the web, writing mock business plans, and trying to develop ideas that i have.<p>but the one thing i continue to struggle with is finding someone else who wants to form a startup.  i work with some very smart people, but the problem is, their whole game plan is built around climbing the corporate ladder, whereas mine couldn't be more opposite.  so what is the best strategy for someone like myself to find a trustworthy, hard working partner to form a startup?  i fully respect what programmers/engineers/hackers bring to the table and i feel that i would compliment those skills very well.  i also have a pretty good understanding of the web and wouldn't consider myself one of those "pie-in-the-sky" business types that are responsible for that stereotype.  i'm just a guy looking to build something cool, solve some problems, and maybe make enough to quit my day-job.  sorry for the long post, but what are your thoughts?	2008-07-11 19:44:30 UTC		19	3

3598852	cloud-based mysql database monitoring from monitis	new feature provides significantly faster insight and root cause analysis	0
san jose, calif., february, 15, 2012 – monitis, the leading cloud and web application monitoring software provider, today announces that it has added comprehensive mysql database monitoring to its award-winning application performance management &#38; monitoring platform. the robust software-as-a-service (saas) tool enables users to gain significantly faster insight when conducting root cause analysis.	3
the mysql monitoring feature includes 246 monitoring variables and more than 21 different metrics to provide one of the easiest to use, yet comprehensive database monitoring tools available. it was first introduced into the free monitor.us platform back in june last year and has seen the code battle hardened by many hundred free users over the last 8 months.	0
hovhannes avoyan, founder and general manager at monitis commented “this feature makes it easy for systems administrators and web developers to measure and monitor the performance of their php environments such as joomla and wordpress, from multiple locations around the world. it gives them a true picture of application performance from where ever in the world the user is. because the monitis mysql monitor is part of the monitis platform it provides an unprecedented holistic view of software, database and underlying hardware, giving pressured techs the ability to quickly and easily diagnose the root cause of slow application performance.”	3
the service uses a small linux agent that can monitor inside an organization’s firewall and distributed systems. the monitis agent connects to a local or remote database and collects a variety of health and performance metrics that are graphically displayed in real-time on a web-based dashboard. users can also set up notifications (should their database go down or pass a certain level of access volume) based on client-defined thresholds and rules.	1
some metrics tracked and reported on by monitis — which can be set up in minutes — include:	4
•	database size	2
•	resource utilization	4
•	analysis of responsiveness/latency	0
•	analysis of throughput	3
•	database usage	4
•	scalability	1
“monitis’ saas delivery and pay as you go pricing mean it’s easy to get going and has low set up and running costs. it puts the power of mysql monitoring in the reach of techs who otherwise wouldn’t have had the time to set up or budget to afford such a comprehensive solution.” adds avoyan	4
monitis mysql monitoring provides much greater check-in frequency, as low as every 5 minutes, and the ability to check the performance of the database from multiple locations around the world.	1
about monitis	0

4073569	do you code mindfully? whats wrong with multitasking? 	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe1dwwojpu0<p>with all the attention mindfulness is getting these days, was just curious to know how many of you do actually believe in it and regularly follow it.<p>somehow i feel its the "right" thing to do (focus on the one thing at hand and the present moment) but then i have following queries on it:<p>1] i am an avid thinker belonging to the camp of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cogito_ergo_sum , and i think with all the millions of thought in my head there will be one "aha" thought that will solve my problem or will give me the next big idea! now, this is inherently in contrast with the mindfulness and the "no-mind" thing. where the idea is to not follow the thoughts so much and just observe them, so eventually they will decrease in quantity ( and increase in quality?). thus you will be able to pay complete attention to the task at hand and perform it with your full heart.<p>there is nothing wrong in it, but consider the following scenario : while i am having my fries at mcdonalds, i get this thought of putting local advertisement on the paper wrapper being used. now should i follow this thought ( which has, hypothetically, the potential to make me a millionaire ) or just observe it and let it pass and enjoy my fries?<p>2] it is extremely difficult to focus on a single task in this digital age. i for instance am working on 5-6 things at any given time ( coding, skype, google reader, support, stack overflow )	3
i know there are techniques available to curb that. but is it worth it? whats wrong in multitasking? are there any proven benefits of not multitasking?<p>i do not intend to criticize the whole "mindfulness" thing. i just feel it looks good on paper and theory, and so am asking you fellow coders about your opinion on the topic and whether you follow it.	2012-06-06 13:08:54 UTC		1	1

4183713	a picture of prototypes in javascript.	javascript prototypes are like a stack of glass sheets with drawings on it. you add more to the picture by stacking another layer of glass.<p>the topmost sheet is the current 'object', and next sheet underneath it is the 'prototoype' of the current object, usually referred to via the "__proto__" key.<p>you can occlude values of the same key, like you can occlude pictures drawn on the same spot.<p>you can only write to the topmost object, as in a stack of glass, where you can only draw on top (unless you manually uncover the sheets).<p>this analogy isn't perfect. in real life, you need to choose which sheet to put upon a stack -- that is, two sheets can't simultaneously be the topmost sheet. but in javascript there is superposition, so to speak.<p>--<p>i have found that you can have a pythonic class system by mixing coffeescript semantic sugar, and the object.setproperty system. you can have rubyesq class (module) property injection as well.<p>https://github.com/jaekwon/cardamom/blob/master/src/clazz.coffee	2012-07-01 03:19:36 UTC		2	4

862730	ask hn: how would you help a person to choose an occupation?	this isn't an abstract problem: i have a very close person in my life, who's 25 and he does not have specific skills. he works in the office as an hr, hates his job and wants to change his life. we agreed, that he will quit his job (having enough savings) soon after we choose what is he going to learn to do in life. the problem is, he does not really know what could that be and feels completely lost.<p>i would like to help him very much, not just seem like i'm helping. so, i decided it would be not such a bad idea to come up with a certain algorithm (which, possibly was used before or could be reused in future for others). while i believe certain personal aspects should be involved when helping to make such a decision, i still can't get rid of an impression there should be some general abstract patterns of which i'm not aware.<p>what would you do? any ideas or suggestions?	2009-10-05 20:42:10 UTC		3	3

2635252	ask hn: what is the $ value of audience data? (bluekai, magnet, exelate, etc..)	the company i work for, a fairly large web publisher, was recently approached by a company wishing to purchase our audience data. we have never sold audience data before, and therefore don't know exactly what commission we should expect a data exchange to take.<p>in the ad network world, i know that commissions range from the 50%-&#62;80% range, depending on a few different factors, as ad networks do have substantial overhead (their ad serving/technology platform, trafficking labour, accounting, salesforce).<p>i would expect data exchangers, on the other hand, to have lower overhead in comparison, as all the transactions are fully digital and automated - meaning their only real costs are software development and business development.<p>does that mean we should expect the data exchangers to ask for proportionally less than what networks take? (i.e. they take 10%-&#62;30%, versus the 30%-&#62;50% more common in the network world?).	2011-06-08 22:23:45 UTC		4	0

8347407	ask hn: pledges for saas startups valuing sustainability and ethics; any interest?	i&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all familiar with the regular posts that pop up here about startups shutting down on their users, often with very little notice.<p>as a potential user, this often makes me uncomfortable investing a lot of time into products i come across.  it&#x27;s difficult to tell the difference between a sustainable business model with clear vision and values, vs the typical &quot;hypergrowth&quot; startup which a year from now will probably have either shut down, completely pivoted, or been acquired.<p>an idea i had which could help alleviate this problem: a set of standardised &quot;pledges&quot; which startups can commit to, which outline some mututally agreeable obligations between the service and the end user.<p>this could of course cover many areas, but the ones that i think would make a good start are: long-term service (x years minimum of guaranteed service), personal data integrity (no selling data to 3rd parties), no data lock-in, transparent subscription pricing, and privacy-first (user data always private unless opting-in).<p>draft for the more detailed conditions of the pledges here:<p>- https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;jamesisaac&#x2f;pledges&#x2f;blob&#x2f;master&#x2f;pledges.md<p>advantage for users: easy to recognise at a glance that the company is following agreeable standards (don&#x27;t have to scrutinise marketing copy &#x2f; terms of use &#x2f; privacy policy).  advantage for providers: clear focus on values could be a usp over competitors.<p>i&#x27;ve created an example of how this could be presented on my product&#x27;s landing page: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;nachapp.com (scroll to &quot;our values&quot;)<p>so, is anyone here interested in this?  i think it would work best as a group&#x2f;community effort where the pledges are finalised by consensus.  so, if you&#x27;re either a user who&#x27;d like to help define what constitutes a good product, or a founder who&#x27;d potentially be interested in committing to these pledges, it would be great if you could drop me an email (contact details in profile) so i can coordinate the effort and keep everyone updated.	2014-09-21 15:49:56 UTC		6	3

7954056	ask hn: good way to recognize and reward team members?	i am a product manager in a startup and we are about to release our mvp.  our team has worked hard and i want to recognize some individuals that worked hard to get it out on schedule.  for obvious reasons i need to keep it simple &amp; cheap but also want to make it something that our guys would take pride in receiving.  the only thing that comes to mind are stickers like those seen on helmets that college football teams give to players that made big contributions.  i know ohio state &amp; florida state are two examples the come to mind.  i would love any suggestions you all have.<p>edit:  would love to give raises and days off but given 1) we are in a startup and 2) i am their peer not their boss, neither of those are options at the moment.  also, i should have added this to my original question, i have tried to be steadfast with my verbal encouragement &amp; praise as we have been picking up momentum.  therefore i was looking for anything that would be meaningful in addition to that.	2014-06-27 14:30:00 UTC		6	1

1510773	tell hn: it's not about domains, it's about a package	i often see advice about domain names and how choosing the correct domain name is one of the most important things to have a successfull concept, but in my opinion it's not about domain names, it's about branding/accounts in general.<p>if you don't have the twitter account, facebook page, linkedin, ... to go with your (domain) name, it's pretty useless to register the domain. people expect a package, not only a domain.<p>that is why tools that do it all (like for ex. http://www.namechecklist.com/ ) are in my eyes far more important then any domain checking tool, you don't want a domain, you want the whole package. it makes finding the correct name harder, but in general it's that name that has to be as unique as possible. it's always better to think about things like this is advance, it's harder to change afterwards...	2010-07-13 08:33:26 UTC		8	0

214037	ask yc: abandon my new corporate job to build my startup?	over the last few months, a friend and i have been growing a startup. we just graduated college. he's moving back home to continue programming at a company he's been with for years. i chose to move to a neighboring city to take a stable job at a growing, somewhat large (~200 people) internet company.<p>i just started yesterday and i already feel like this wasn't the right decision. our plan was to continue working in our free time to grow the site, but i want to dedicate 100% of my time to it, something that my partner is unwilling to do due to overbearing student loan payments and the allure of a near-six figure salary at his job. i fear that we'll both become too busy and worn out from our jobs and lose momentum with our venture.<p>are there any people here who have successfully grown a company in their free time, ultimately making their venture full-time? i wonder how many people here are working on their startups part time?	2008-06-10 16:54:48 UTC		22	2

2624596	ask hn: soon-to-be cs graduate. best resources for finding decent job.	i'm currently positioned to graduate from my cs major this december. it's from a state school and is abet certified. i really love to program and enjoy learning as much as possible about different coding techniques as well as getting really in-depth with the details around programming.<p>that being said, i'm currently on the lookout to try and find a job once i graduate. i'd like to have something lined up by the end of summer. i'm for sure planning to relocate (preferably to the sf bay area). i've been an entrepreneur my entire life, but am ready to trade that in so that i can focus on learning as much about programming as possibly without the extra headaches of running your own business. i've spent a lot of effort to learn and effectively use most of the web based technologies, as well as the standard desktop programming languages (c++, c#, java, etc.)<p>so far, i've been searching for jobs on dice and monster, searched through some on craigslist, and have been networking with anyone i know, and whom those people know, to find people in companies that would allow to get my foot in the door.<p>i've applied directly on some of the bigger companies web sites (google, apple, etc.), but am still waiting to hear something back. i'm married and have a young child, so some amount of stability within the company at the moment would be nice, but not absolutely necessary as i've survived this long without much financial stability.<p>any help / advice would be much appreciated.<p>thanks.	1

5574293	bitcoin, artificial intelligence, economy and buddhism	greed has been a major problem for both bitcoin and our society as a whole. it surely leads us to both economic and environmental disaster and the time is running out. even though bitcoin was envisioned as decentralized exchange system the reality shows us that it turned into the vehicle for speculators, day traders and bankers plus professional miners taking control away from a little guy who is left behind as usual.<p>did satoshi think about that when he envisioned bitcoin? what we see now is that bitcoin exposes one important issue, namely human psychology and the fact that it absolutely has to be factored in.<p>now, what if we will have bitcoin 2.0 or some other crypto 2.0 that is based or run by ai that bases its principles of work on fairness, altruism, and kindness? (i.e. buddhist values)? the system will be designed in a way that everyone will have a fair chance to get a block, and it will not depend on the capital the person has. furthermore, the ai could be trained to detect "greedy" transactions and mitigate them, so no matter how much fat banker or day trader try to accumulate bitcoin 2.0 he will not be able to. imagine what this could do for human society as a whole. it is like we can erase everything and start from the scratch all over again without any fat cats having any advantage.<p>what do you think?	2013-04-19 01:41:45 UTC		4	0

my government blocks all the political or barely political websites (eg gmail.com) in my country. i am in us right now and would like to build a web circumventor or proxy server to help those in the country. i know there are already lots of proxy servers, but most of them are banned too. plus i want to learn how to do this myself. if you have advice or resources (eg books/tutorials/code) on how to build a great proxy server, please let me know.<p>(i am thinking about implementing it on the google app engine server (python))<p>thanks,	0

worked so hard that i poured my entire soul and heart into my new product. so if you believe every soul is unique then there must be something unique about it, right?<p>after all the work done i think it is time to push my baby out the door even though it thinks it is not ready. but who decides readiness? my first product was not even half ready when i launched it so i think this should be ok to release.<p>i was a total newbie when it came to anything related to internet application development. my brain was wired for only database and java programming.	4
so i had to learn php,javascript,jquery etc from scratch, do the research, experiment, learn and implement. so 2 yrs is complete end to end, evenings and weekends. in 2006 i quit my job and started working on my first product and did consulting on the side. now i have quit consulting permanently and working on my new product. i can say, i have finally burnt all my bridges :)<p>here is the product info	3

i will know that and will automatically email you the license information.<p>after that if you like to review it and provide feedback it would be awesome.<p>email me directly at support@mockuptiger.com for all of the below<p>if you hit any issues installing on your desktop or domain<p>here is the download with instructions<p>http://www.mockuptiger.com/how-to-download-and-start-mockuptiger-on-desktop  (note, in step 6, enter 'hacker' as last name)<p>for server install<p>http://www.mockuptiger.com/how-to-installhost-mockups-on-your-own-server-or-domain (note, in step 3, enter 'hacker' as last name)<p>thank you	3

971404	ask hn- could any one person have all of these skills?	i own a popular discussion forum that has grown over the past few years into one of the top resource sites for it's niche. i am looking to transition the site away from being just a discussion forum and more toward a full blown site, similar to one that a trade publication might have, with news, articles etc... i already have the base of traffic and now i want to serve them additional content and add new features.<p>i need to have a site built around the forum, or modified, to enable a quality interface, easy editing options, simple advertising interface, email marketing etc...<p>there is also a current database with the posts and the users and if there is a larger infrastructure created, then that database would need to be accessed by several new parts of the site in different manners.<p>i think i could afford to hire maybe one full time programmer at this time, while i handle all of the marketing, content creation, community management etc...<p>is it possible to find someone who is a jack of all trades that can build out the infrastructure, figure out how the databases need to run and interface with different parts of the site, integrate them with an email marketing solution like aweber, etc...?<p>the features that i am looking for for the website to have all include things that currently exist, from q and a to article display to commenting and rating, profiles etc... nothing too revolutionary or proprietary.<p>i have no technical skills whatsoever, i don't eve know basic html, and i need to know if this is the type of thing that could be reasonably expected of one person, or am i being too greedy in what i expect?<p>assuming said programmer exists, is that a very rare skill set, or could any normal programmer working full time bang something like this out?<p>also, what would an appropriate salary range be for a programmer like this if i offered no equity?<p>would that range change substantially if i offered equity? would my chances of landing someone good change?(the site is already profitable, although the profit would be eaten up by a programmers salary)<p>finally, are there people i could hire to help me figure out the technical requirements i will have and to help me hire someone appropriate, since i am in no position to judge anyone's technical abilities?<p>thanks a bunch	2009-12-02 03:05:47 UTC		8	3

8528817	ask hn: i keep doing the same thing over and over, how do i change?	so in the past 4 years i worked on creating a saas product in a particular niche and it goes down something like this:<p>1) build product<p>2) get a few paying customers<p>3) start working on improving it for customers<p>4) realize product is bloated or is pretty lacking in features.<p>5) build more features.<p>6) no increase in sales, keeps building<p>7) gets tired, refund users, abandon working on it.<p>8) starts hating 9-5 job, repeat the whole cycle again.<p>is my problem, finding a market fit first? i automatically assumed that because of poor sales, i must be lacking in features so i immediately start building. but i get really burnt out by doing this. i almost always end up refunding my customers because i realize what i spent months building is lacking.<p>the biggest problem i have is, when i start to make incremental changes to the product, i keep having the urge to restart from scratch. however, it&#x27;s a huge time sink to do this again and again (4 times already). i&#x27;m beginning to think this is just an issue with me.<p>i&#x27;m basically in my fourth iteration and i think it&#x27;s finally clicking. something is deadly wrong with my thought process.<p>any insight would help.<p>i built the product. i built the website. i got a few customers. then i get burnt out building more features or making it &quot;perfect&quot;. then i can&#x27;t work on it anymore and so i look for a job.<p>after 4 years, i either introduce a change in my process and turn this into a sustainable income or i just give up completely.	2014-10-29 18:10:08 UTC		8	4

1829124	ask hn: how do you tune your life?	time is a valuable asset and we have a limited amount to spend on our project, considering that we have also to live a good life to avoid stress and burnout. how do you tune your life and manage your time to be able to waste as less as possible?<p>i will begin with what i do. i have a full time job and i work on a personal project on my spare time. of course with all this work the risk of burnout is big, as i already experienced in the past: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1545774<p>i can tell you how i manage right now. i'm 20 minutes biking from work, and usually 15 minutes from anywhere else. biking saves me a lot of commuting time, because i don't have to rely on public transportation. here in amsterdam i can bike where i want and it's much faster than taking a tram. moreover it's healthy, so i can keep fit during the week too.<p>i start working at 9, but i wake up at 6, so each morning i get a couple of hours to work on my project. this implies of course that i have to go to sleep early in the evening, so i usually go to bed at 10 to have the sufficient amount of sleep, which is crucial to stay productive.<p>i'm now in the proceeds to buy a house. the main reasons to buy a house still apply, but i have some more: living in my own house will mean i will not have to deal with a landlord, which is making me lose a lot of time right now. moreover when i will be living alone, i will pay someone to clean the house instead of doing it myself. i value my time more than the money cleaners ask and i'm willing to spend money to get back time. washing machine for clothes, dishwasher for dishes and i don't iron clothes at all (if you learn how to hang them it's almost useless).<p>to avoid the burnout, i made up some rules: no work in the evenings, so when i go home from work and i'm tired i don't have the pressure of doing something on myself and i can spend those 2 spare hours after dinner relaxing (reading a book or some hobby). on friday i dance tango, on weekends i usually work on my project but still i go to parties or out with friends. sometimes i go on a trip somewhere. i go running for one hour every weekend, to keep fit, release stress and clear my mind. this all helps to avoid burnout and stress.<p>how do you tune your life?	2010-10-25 09:27:25 UTC		99	1

1862800	important information about google buzz class action settlement	google rarely contacts gmail users via email, but we are making an exception to let you know that we've reached a settlement in a lawsuit regarding google buzz (http://buzz.google.com), a service we launched within gmail in february of this year.<p>shortly after its launch, we heard from a number of people who were concerned about privacy. in addition, we were sued by a group of buzz users and recently reached a settlement in this case.<p>the settlement acknowledges that we quickly changed the service to address users' concerns. in addition, google has committed $8.5 million to an independent fund, most of which will support organizations promoting privacy education and policy on the web. we will also do more to educate people about privacy controls specific to buzz. the more people know about privacy online, the better their online experience will be.<p>just to be clear, this is not a settlement in which people who use gmail can file to receive compensation. everyone in the u.s. who uses gmail is included in the settlement, unless you personally decide to opt out before december 6, 2010. the court will consider final approval of the agreement on january 31, 2011. this email is a summary of the settlement, and more detailed information and instructions approved by the court, including instructions about how to opt out, object, or comment, are available at http://www.buzzclassaction.com.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------	2

8816842	ask hn: how best to collaborate between designers and developers?	this is a question about productivity and task management software. i recognize that when it comes to topics like these everyone has their own opinions and there rarely is one &quot;correct&quot; answer. i&#x27;m looking for perspective more than anything else.<p>this is my situation. in one of the organizations i contribute to, we collaborate very successfully using github for code sharing, task management, code reviews, the whole nine yards. on top of this, we use slack to manage private and group messages. this works very well for us; we communicate well, are rather productive, and friction between contributors is low. to top it all off, this group is a comfortable size (eight people) made up of dedicated, experienced individuals.<p>the story for the other group that i contribute to is quite different. we&#x27;ve always used github for code sharing, but we&#x27;ve never really tapped into its more powerful features for code review, issue and task management, etc. when it comes to interpersonal communication, we use facebook almost exclusively, which has led to a general breakdown of focused discussion, which means that we easily fall off topic and little gets done. this group is larger and much more diverse. it&#x27;s a student organization, so there&#x27;s a strong emphasis placed on inclusion. few more than a handful of members have any solid experience, though that by no means implies that they lack talent. because of the emphasis on inclusion and diversity, this group has much more representation by artistically-oriented designers. in the past it has been argued (rather naively and without real deliberation) that we should abstain from services like github for task management since these services are prejudiced towards programmers.<p>the question then is this: for those people who feel that they&#x27;ve collaborated successfully on a team made up of both designers and developers, what, technological or otherwise, has best contributed to your overall success and cohesiveness?	2014-12-30 21:29:07 UTC		1	0

7942352	ask hn: how to scale 1 server : 1 customer model?	hi guys i need some help figuring out this pattern.	3
i have a web application currently running on flask at site.com	0
for each of my customer, i want to have a droplet from digitalocean running the copy of the flask app.<p>i want to consolidate them under a subdomain like customername.site.com<p>so when they go to customername.site.com, the ip points to their own server.<p>now the problem i have is handling cases like:	4
user logs in at site.com, needs to be logged in at customername.site.com	3
user logs out at customername.site.com, needs to be logged out at site.com	3
how do you configure an encrypted password for a new droplet instance?	1
how do you update all droplets with updated code?<p>the reason i have one user per one droplet is because they run cpu and network intensive background jobs in parallel. i don&#x27;t want them to interfere with each other.<p>i guess i&#x27;m trying to achieve horizontal scalability, by just cloning an instance of my original web application, instead of trying to force everyone on the same instance.	3

6001664	the best thing i ever did	was tell apple, no.  im not changing my app. (and nor will i write any more for your app store)<p>the next best thing i did was stop being a slave to this machine.<p>why would i let apple force me to write more code when an app has been tested to the extreme, but they have &quot;opinions&quot; which are not related to security or reliability, which force me to redesign a perfectly good app?<p>it&#x27;s not about walled gardens anymore kids, no its not about security.  its about minimum wage kids telling you to redesign your app because those kids have an opinion. (and they are soo valid)<p>i have lost any respect for apple i may have had.  and although i make more than my developer fees cost, im done with both ios and mac app stores.<p>apple&#x27;s opinions mean less than nothing to me.  i make working&#x2f;secure&#x2f;non douchy (looking at you facebook) software at my own expense, and i dont care what apple thinks about it.<p>so maybe ill be the one stewing over it, or ill probably just let it go, once the terrible ios7 wrecks ios.<p>but thats a side note.  im a pro, and i really dont care what apple thinks.<p>i suggest you adopt the same approach.<p>ditch the app store its a fucking joke.	2013-07-07 10:26:20 UTC		1	4

5602613	ask hn: which design rights are enforceable in the united states?	hey guys,<p>i created a puzzle game as a side project a few years back.  it's similar to a rubik's cube, but in 2d instead of 3d.  here's the google play listing:<p>http://goo.gl/o7x6i<p>an identical listing also appears in amazon's and barnes and noble's stores.  yesterday, i received a takedown notice from amazon that advised me to contact rubik's cube's security team.  their representative sent me this note:<p>&#62; (y)our images of the cube is infringing our designrights. please see attached certificate. you will have to change the design of your cube or get a license from rubik's cube.<p>&#62; attachment: http://goo.gl/08cq6<p>i'm based in the us and they are based in sweden.  my understanding of us ip law is that puzzle design is not protectable, and i was very careful not to call my puzzle a rubik's cube in its description.  i don't know what the rules are in europe.<p>the name, design, and logo of cognicube are distinctively mine.  i don't believe the concept of sliding colored bricks to solve a puzzle is protectable in the us.<p>the only thing i can see in their application that is even remotely similar to cognicube is their logo.  it's is an isometric projection of a rubik's cube from the corner.  in the tablet version of cognicube, there's a view that shows all six faces of the cube displayed in quasi-3d.  it's not my logo, and it's drawn from a different angle than the image in their trademark.  (it also has six faces instead of three.)<p>compare:<p>- their logo: http://goo.gl/ozd0c<p>- my screenshot: http://goo.gl/3stve<p>i know that hacker news is not an outlet for legal advice, but i imagine you guys may have run into similar issues before.  are eu design rights enforcable in the us?  do you see anything i've done that infringes their rights in the us?<p>i've only made a couple hundred dollars over the last few years on this project, so it might not be worth contesting, but if i'm actually infringing something, i'd like to know for next time.  =)<p>thanks!	2013-04-24 17:08:29 UTC		2	3

i'm currently using googlegroups for a listserv, but i'm a bit frustrated by the whole google account thing for sign-ups - i would rather be able to just add their e-mail to a db. does anyone have experience with alternative listservs? this wouldn't be a newsletter, per se, as anyone in the group would be able to send emails to the list. ideally, the contents of the e-mails would be backed up automatically, and, if possible, viewable online through some sort of feed.	4

7618288	ask hn: side-project website creation tools? 	hey folks,	1
a friend and i are thinking of working on a (small) side project and i&#x27;m stumped over what tools to use to create our website. basically it will be a listing of all the organic meat farms in our state that a user can search to find the products being sold near their location. for example, you could search for a grass-fed beef farm within 20 miles of your zip code.<p>i haven&#x27;t really worked with websites using lots of data and needing search capabilities before. i am ok with using a bit of css and a small (emphasis on small) amount of html to tweak the design, but i&#x27;m really not familiar with anything more complicated than that. ideally, i would like a solution available for free or a low monthly cost (this is a side project after all).<p>here are the goals&#x2f;workflow&#x2f;revenue thoughts:<p>a farmer&#x2f;rancher would register for an account and fill out a form with their address, the types of meat they sell, whether they deliver or require pick-up, the characteristics of the product (organic, grass-fed, hormone free), and any other relevant data.<p>a consumer would come to the site, not need to register, and search for products by type (for example, hormone free, grass fed beef), and be able to limit a search to a certain distance from their zip code or see the results on a map. if they click on a result they would be taken to the farm&#x27;s website or a results&#x2f;bio page with a phone number.<p>revenue would probably come from email marketing to customers who sign up, or from ads shown on the page or a yearly fee to farmers.<p>any thoughts? wordpress, weebly? i&#x27;m not really sure how all the options available to me would work with all the searching users would be doing. mapping seems an important component, and registration is a biggie. but i do not need ecommerce abilities, as its a side project and i don&#x27;t want to get into the business of selling food products over the internet. ideas, suggestions?	2014-04-20 20:04:16 UTC		2	0

2219566	ask hn: starting a business with full time job	hi guys, first post on the board...<p>i was curious if any one has a success or horror story about creating a startup while working full time in a corporate environment (eventually transitioning to the startup).<p>i have a great idea for the industry my employer is in. i have already began building the product on force.com on my own time and have my first customer with 500 users waiting for me to finish.<p>i would not be competing with my current employer, but creating a service that would in turn help my employer (and their competitors)  sell products more effectively. this is something i have tried pushing through our company with no success, so i figure it's time to do it myself.<p>i am working as fast as i can in my spare time, carefully separating my personal time from my employer's time. i should complete my work sometime next month.<p>has anyone been in a similar situation and had issues with their employer when leaving? i dont want my employer to claim rights over what i have created in my spare time.<p>thoughts? suggestions?	2011-02-15 01:11:55 UTC		5	3

7550950	ask hn: how can i pay for college?	hello<p>i am currently a high school senior and need to commit to a college by may 1st. i was accepted into a number of large universities with great computer engineering departments, but i was denied from the &quot;name&quot; schools (ivy&#x27;s, mit, stanford) that have the resources to truly cover financial need. my top choice school is usc, as i was accepted into the iovine&#x2f;young academy for arts, technology, and the business of innovation (https:&#x2f;&#x2f;iovine-young.usc.edu&#x2f;), which appears to be an awesome program focused on exactly the areas i want to study. i was lucky enough to have been awarded a half-tuition merit scholarship, in addition to $8,000 in federal loans. however, that still leaves a $30,000 a year gap. i have some college savings from past internships and a florida prepaid savings plan, but not nearly what i need. as my parents currently have no income, i don&#x27;t think they would qualify for a federal plus loan or even be able to cosign a private college loan.<p>[continued in comments- hn&#x27;s character count is inaccurate for some reason]	2014-04-08 01:47:25 UTC		9	0

1017138	hello hn, take a look at my new (beta) app bonmp3?	hi hn,<p>first off, it's been great following you since september. i really feel like i've learned some valuable insights into technology, business, science, and so many other topics from you. and attending this recent startup school was probably the turning point for me, when i resolved to make something that people want to use, that people love.<p>i've always been really interested in music. i played bass and drums for years growing up, though between you and i, i never managed to develop a good sense of rhythm. my older brother was seemingly infinitely talented in every instrument he touched, and played in local bands for years. of course i was jealous.<p>it's been a long time since those days, but i've finally settled on my contribution to the music scene. it's a music distribution service that bands and musicians can sign up for. nothing too different so far, however, instead of the status quo of a ~70% return on album sales to the musician, we're targeting 90%. we're also going to donate <i>most</i> of that other 10% to the save the music foundation for the first six months, and 1% for each month afterwards, as long as the service is alive and kicking. we like to call it music distribution with a conscience.<p>i really don't plan to make (a ton of) money off of this site, or quit my day job, which i'm hoping will help differentiate us from the competition. the business infrastructure behind music is showing signs of aging, inefficiency, etc, etc, and the vision here is to show how simple and efficient music distribution can be, and (hopefully) that it pays to put the musician first.<p>anyway, i should probably give you the link so you can tell me how beta my beta service is. in case you haven't gathered so far, it's pretty solidly in the beta category. and by beta, i mean it should all work but is still facing some big development efforts:<p>http://bonmp3.com/<p>thanks hn!	2009-12-27 15:35:16 UTC		11	4

8576848	ask hn: maybe found huge security problem, unsure what to do	let me just start off saying i&#x27;m 100% amateur and i don&#x27;t really know that much so i could be all wrong.<p>i was browsing the website and got redirected to a random url. tracing the requests back i found that the redirect was caused by improperly sanitized html. the exploit more or less gives you an iframe worth of functionality. this allows for very sophisticated phishing.<p>firefox is not vulnerable to this (you might be able to guess what the vuln is from that).<p>now this actually pales in comparison to the 2nd exploit i found. i&#x27;m significantly less sure this works but i&#x27;m still pretty sure it will. i have only tested it out on the preview mode and not published.<p>the preview mode does sanitize(hits their server and comes back, basic stuff like &lt;script&gt; gets cleaned up). it just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job at it. now, they could have 2 different checks, one being more secure when publishing but this seems unlikely. i&#x27;m not really familiar with the applicable laws so i&#x27;m not willing to actually publish an attack to test.<p>the 2nd exploit allows me pretty much free reign on their page. more or less it lets you execute whatever javascript you want.<p>i have sent the company 2x messages through a form they have for reporting securities vulnerabilities. however i&#x27;m not even sure that they got through as i never received a confirmation email (it said one would be sent).<p>i tried calling as well but i just discovered it last night and i haven&#x27;t gotten through to anyone who knows anything.<p>my conundrum is this is an extremely popular website. top 100 on alexa, 30bn+ market cap. if this vulnerability is actually real i&#x27;m not sure i&#x27;m comfortable sitting on the information for a prolonged period of time considering how easy it would be to exploit.<p>in the meantime i&#x27;m going to continue to try and contact the company but i&#x27;m not really sure what my next steps should be otherwise.	2014-11-08 13:49:21 UTC		80	2

87522	an offer	hello friends,<p>recently, a startup made me an offer to move to san francisco from missouri to work with them.  it would be great to get your thoughts and opinions, and to learn from your experience.<p>i'm nineteen, and i've been programming for seven years.  i left high school when i was seventeen to work in the video game industry.  over the last few years, my job has improved my programming skill from "decent" to "pretty competent".  i can hold my own, fix bugs that aren't mine, and implement new features and big systems.  some screenshots of my three-year-old demos can be found here:  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16941908@n08/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/16941908@n08/</a>   and you can actually play those demos by downloading them from here:  <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?b9mvmstg04v" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?b9mvmstg04v</a>  <p>the startup is a group of seriously awesome fellas, and they're extremely smart.  it would be fantastic to jump into the startup scene feet-first by joining them.  <p>to keep confidentiality, let's say that i would be anywhere from the 7th to the 10th hire.  i was offered a salary of $60,000.  as to the stock, i'm extremely new to the terminology, so please bear with me.  to avoid saying the exact share numbers, let's pretend that i was offered four shares, vested over four years.  the total number of "authorized shares" is then 2391.56, and the total number of "issued shares" is 1916.1.  (again, those numbers are not the actual numbers, but they are accurate in proportion with each other.)  there is a double trigger acceleration of 50%, so if they were bought before the shares were fully vested, i'd receive 50% of the rest.<p>is that offer reasonable?  i'm certainly not counting on them getting bought.  i'd simply like to find an interesting project and then really throw myself at it.  <p>some other questions, if you don't mind:  what's it like to live in, or near, san francisco?  what would you do in this situation?  <p>thanks a lot.  i really appreciate your feedback on this.<p>shawn	2007-12-09 23:37:28 UTC		39	4

(i live in the east bay)<p>i don't know of many programmers in my school. i know one person who has a sort of entrepreneurial side of himself but i don't need the entrepreneurial sense (he also doesn't do much), i need someone with a greater or equal knowledge of programming and (more importantly) a drive to actually use that knowledge. i know a few people in startups and plenty of people who work in some part of silicon valley, but most of those people are considerably older than me (40+) and/or not someone who i would want to work with.<p>you might be wondering how being in high school is related to finding a co-founder, or if not a co-founder someone to work on a particular project with, and it's because based on what i've read/heard, people find co-founders in college/university. i don't have that advantage of being grouped with people of similar interest.	2011-03-30 23:29:40 UTC		2	2

i wrote a c compiler for a very large subset (not all) of c89 for this cpu:  https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;roberteldersoftware&#x2f;recc	3
i wrote emulators for the cpu in 4 different languages: https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;roberteldersoftware&#x2f;recc&#x2f;tree&#x2f;master&#x2f;emulators	1
i wrote bare bones microkernel:  https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;roberteldersoftware&#x2f;recc&#x2f;tree&#x2f;master&#x2f;kernel	3
i can cross-compile the preprocessor, lexer, parser and code generator and run them inside a kernel task, which runs inside the cpu emulators for javascript, python, java, and c (but it is currently super slow): http:&#x2f;&#x2f;recc.robertelder.org&#x2f;compile-demo&#x2f;<p>i&#x27;m looking for feedback on what direction to go in next.  what would you like to see most?<p>directions i can go in:<p>-  fully client side c compiler and ide	0
- full access to parse tree, static analysis with rich html annotations for errors	4
-  for example, if a function call has arguments that don&#x27;t match the prototype, show a detailed graphic demonstrating that the arguments don&#x27;t fit into the function	0
-  write a proper shell for the kernel	4
-  cpu emulators for more languages	2
-  make the compiler produce faster code (it is currently anti-optimized for code simplicity)	4
-  implement currently unsupported c features (float, double, union, goto, k&amp;r c style functions, ...)	3
-  work toward having better static analysis (warnings) than gcc or clang (but only for c89)	1
-  write blog posts (about what?)	3
-  work toward compiling the linux kernel	4
-  create learning tools to help visualize the os and program stack as the program executes (in addition to showing stack values, provide type annotations via background colours&#x2f;graphics eg. (0x10000 &lt;= unsigned int))	3
-  static analysis for misra c	3
-  a web based visual tool&#x2f;animation that shows you every step of how the c preprocessor works	3

5516386	web & application design: we've been designing for a very specific use case	i realized something recently and curious what others think. we seem to design for the web, desktop applications, etc. based upon three specific things:<p>1. seated close	1
2. relatively large screen	0
3. precise mouse<p>if you take any of these things away... you can no longer cram functionality into screen space as we currently do.<p>it is the reason behind responsive design and the "mobile first" approach. you take away the precision mouse and the large screen and you have trouble. i'd actually say true screen size isn't even as much of an issue as is the precision (or lack of) of your finger. especially considering you can put the mobile phone very close to your face.<p>in principle, mobile design is even similar to the other end of the spectrum, tv design. although the screen is large, you sit far away, effectively reducing functional screen size. throw in the use of a controller or even gesture control (i.e. kinect) into the mix and the similarity between mobile and tv is even more striking.<p>it seems we've been designing for a very specific use case that is currently changing with phones, tablets, and even smart tvs. but do you think the "sit close, large screen, precise mouse" design paradigm going to fade away entirely? i suppose perhaps it can't because of productivity applications... but i wonder if there will be an upheaval there? will see cluttered screens and toolbars give way to cleaner interfaces (everywhere)?<p>and would that even be beneficial? or akin to trying to fit a square peg into a round hole?	2013-04-09 04:05:26 UTC		1	2

phonon does not depend on other frameworks like jquery and completely supports amd (asynchronous module definition). also, if you have experience on android, the page lifecycle is based on android activities (oncreate, onready, etc).<p>why use phonon? it is simple to use, really light, cordova friendly and the backend components are essential to create a quick, functional hybrid app.<p>feel free to try it! it is open source :)	2015-03-08 15:54:43 UTC		1	2
